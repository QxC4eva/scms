<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All Water-type attacks (with the exception of <a href="/bw/moves/water_pledge">Water Pledge</a>), even those from the wielder's ally in multi battles, hit the wielder with 100% accuracy regardless of the intended target, and give a Special Attack boost of one stage instead of doing damage. If the wielder and a Pokemon using <a href="/bw/moves/follow_me">Follow Me</a> are out at the same time, and a Pokemon uses a Water-type attack targeted at the Follow Me user's team, Follow Me will take precedence. If <a href="/bw/moves/hidden_power">Hidden Power</a> is Water-type, it will be redirected and absorbed as well. <a href="/bw/moves/soak">Soak</a> is also redirected and nullified by Storm Drain. If a Pokemon with <a href="/bw/abilities/mold_breaker">Mold Breaker</a> uses a Water-type attack, it will be redirected but not absorbed by Storm Drain. If two Pokemon have Storm Drain in a multi battle, the faster Pokemon will draw the attack. In the event of a speed tie, the Pokemon who has been on the field longest will draw the attack.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Storm Drain was next to useless in Generation 4. Now it has given rise to <a href="/bw/pokemon/gastrodon">Gastrodon</a>, one of the best anti-metagame Pokemon currently. The immunity plus the Special Attack boost allows Gastrodon to check almost everything on an offensive <a href="/bw/abilities/drizzle">Drizzle</a> team and as such makes it an easy fit to a lot of teams. Outside of Gastrodon, <a href="/bw/pokemon/cradily">Cradily</a> is another possible good user of Storm Drain, given its typing, but it certainly isn't as good as Gastrodon is. Storm Drain can get really annoying fast if you have nothing to take out Gastrodon with. Storm Drain is also why Gastrodon is viable in Ubers, letting it be one of the best <a href="/bw/pokemon/kyogre">Kyogre</a> counters in the game.</p>
