<h2>Competitive Usage</h2>
<p>Reckless is limited in distribution, with only 7 fully evolved Pokemon getting this ability. It's actually pretty useful, with a few Pokemon, such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/staraptor">Staraptor</a>, benefiting greatly from the boost to the already devastating power of STAB Double-Edge and Brave Bird. While the increased recoil damage owing to the increased damage output cuts down on their lifespans, most of the wielders are frail already, and would appreciate the boost to their moves far more. An oddity of this ability is that it boosts the "Jump Kick" moves by 20% but doesn't increase the damage they cause to the user on missing. This means that <a href="/bw/pokemon/hitmonlee">Hitmonlee</a> can unleash ferociously powerful attacks with little consequence (Hi Jump Kick becomes 234 Base Power factoring in STAB and Reckless). <a href="/bw/pokemon/mienshao">Mienshao</a> has Reckless as a Dream World ability, but generally prefers <a href="/bw/abilities/regenerator">Regenerator</a>.</p>
