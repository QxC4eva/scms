Overview
########
- The nerf to Drizzle hurt Politoed's viability a lot.
- Rain is still a threatening force in the current metagame, especially because it's so unprepared for, and Politoed is the centerpiece of most rain teams.
- Politoed even has a unique set of support moves to further support its team, such as Encore and Perish Song.
- It has pretty average stats all across the board.
- Offensive movepool is mediocre.
- It now faces stiff competition from the likes of Zapdos and Deoxys-S as a rain setter.

Rain Support
########
name: Rain Support
move 1: Scald
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Encore / Perish Song
move 4: Toxic / Rain Dance
ability: Drizzle
item: Damp Rock
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========
- Scald is a must-have for every bulky Water, and Politoed's Drizzle even gives it a sizable power boost.
- Ice Beam has great coverage alongside Scald, as it hits Water resists like Grass- and Dragon-types for super effective damage.
- Encore is a nice way of stopping Pokemon that think they can set up on Politoed, and it even gives frail rain sweepers like Kabutops and Keldeo a free switch-in.
- Perish Song can be used instead to pseudo-phaze while also serving as a last-ditch attempt to sweepers.
- Toxic cripples many Pokemon that like switching in on Politoed, like Gastrodon and Latias.
- Rain Dance, on the other hand, is a great move to use on a predicted Mega Charizard-Y, (Mega) Tyranitar, or Hippodown switch, foiling their plans to remove your weather.
- Protect can be used alongside Perish Song to defeat setup sweepers with more ease, but it also wastes crucial rain turns.
- Rest + Sleep Talk can be used as it is Politoed's only form of recovery, but it's fairly gimmicky and lessens the amount of support Politoed can offer to its team.

Set Details
========
- HP and Defense are maximized to let Politoed take on the physical attackers it cripples with Scald.
- Damp Rock is the item of choice, as it lengthens the duration of rain from five turns to eight, giving Politoed's teammates more than enough time to wreck havoc.
- Leftovers can be used instead so Politoed has some form of healing, but it greatly lessens the effect of Drizzle.

Usage Tips
========
- Politoed's main role is to activate rain with Drizzle.
- Due to XY mechanics, rain only lasts for a limited amount of turns, which means that you need to send Politoed back in to re-activate rain.
- Scald is usually the most spammable move for Politoed, as it has decent power under ran and can cripple both offensive and defensive Pokemon with a Scald burn.
- Keep track of Politoed's health, as it will need to continuously keep switching in and out to active rain.

Team Options
========
- The most obvious teammates for Politoed are those that require rain support or really appreciate it.
- Swift Swim Pokemon are an extremely scary force to face in the rain, with the best examples being Kingdra, Kabutops, Ludicolo, and Omastar.
- Bulky Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile love the rain, as it alleviates their Fire-type weaknesses, letting them make better use of their bulk and have an easier time setting up.
- Thundurus-T and Jolteon can absorb Electric-type attacks aimed at their Water-type teammates and fire back 100% accurate Thunders.
- Grass-types like Amoonguss and Ferrothorn are nice to deal with opposing Water-types like Keldeo and Azumarill, and they also appreciate their Fire-type weaknesses being alleviated.
- A backup rain setter is also recommended to ease the pressure off of Politoed; Zapdos, Deoxys-S, and Thundurus are great examples of this.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Focus Blast / Scald
ability: Drizzle
item: Choice Specs / Damp Rock
evs: 172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
- When boosted by Choice Specs and rain, Hydro Pump will hurt despite coming from a relatively low base 90 Special Attack stat.
- Ice Beam provides great coverage for Politoed, letting it hit bulky Grass- and Dragon-types, such as Celebi and Latias.
- Psychic is used primarily for Mega Venusaur, but it also hits roadblocks for rain, such as Tentacruel and Toxicroak, really hard.
- Focus Blast is used to get past Ferrothorn, a common check to both Politoed and rain teams as a whole.
- Scald can be used instead as a more reliable STAB, and it also has a decent burn chance that can cripple defensive checks like Latias and Mega Venusaur.

Set Details
========
- Maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature is used to guarantee the highest damage output.
- 84 Speed EVs let Politoed outspeed everything up to uninvested base 80s, most notably Mega Venusaur.
- The rest is thrown in HP for more bulk.
- Choice Specs is the preferred item, as it gives Politoed insane power.
- Damp Rock can be used instead to lengthen the duration of rain, but Politoed will then miss out on crucial KOs, such as a 2HKO on Mega Venusaur with Psychic.

Usage Tips
========
This Politoed is played much more offensively, as it greatly pressures its opponents with boosted Hydro Pumps
Politoed's coverage moves should only be used on predicted switches into Water resists, as Hydro Pump will almost always be a better choice otherwise
Politoed still sets up rain with Drizzle, providing some sort of utility, just keep in mind that it will be limited to five turn if using Choice Specs

Team Options
========
- This variant of Politoed's teammates should mostly be those that can work their best on offensive rain teams.
- Swift Swim Pokemon are again great choices, since Politoed also can soften walls for them to blow past late-game.
- Keldeo is a great partner for offensive Politoed, blowing past Chansey and Ferrothorn, two Pokemon that usually trouble it.
- Electric-types like Thundurus-T and Jolteon are also appreciated to take on Electric-type moves while firing off powerful 100% accurate Thunders.
- Backup rain setters are hugely appreciated, especially if Politoed uses Choice Specs; Deoxys-S, Zapdos, and Thundurus are great examples that would fit well on offensive rain teams.
- Tornadus and Tornadus-T are also great rain setters that can also utilize a 100% accurate STAB in Hurricane; Tornadus-T is also an excellent pivot that's appreciated on offensive rain teams.

Other Options
########
- A Choice Scarf set is a nice alternative to the sets above, but it forces Politoed to lose out on Damp Rock, which it really hates unless its new item gives a sizable power boost, which Choice Scarf doesn't.
- Chesto Berry + Rest is a good option to fully cure Politoed so it can keep supporting its team, but again, the loss of Damp Rock really sucks.
- Haze is a more reliable way of just getting rid of an opposing setup sweeper's boost, but Encore and Perish Song provide more utility in the long run.
- Refresh can be used to cure Politoed of troubling status, but its other support moves are usually superior.
- Surf is an alternative STAB that has both reliability and power, but Scald is almost always better due to its higher utility.
- Hidden Power Grass hits Pokemon like Gastrodon and Rotom-W for super effective damage, but it doesn't even OHKO Gastrodon, even with a Choice Specs boost, making it relatively useless.

Checks & Counters
########

**Water Immune Pokemon**: Water immune Pokemon not only check Politoed very well, but also are great checks to other rain Pokemon. Gastrodon is the best of these, since its secondary Ground typing also lets it wall Electric-types. Vaporeon, Toxicroak, and Jellicent are also good checks, but they face trouble from common Thunders and Hurricanes that rain teams carry.

**Ferrothorn**: Ferrothorn is an excellent check to Politoed while also checking many rain Pokemon, like Kingdra, Thundurus, and Kabutops. It does need to be wary of a Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast from Politoed, as well as strong Hurricanes and Keldeo's Secret Sword that are common on rain teams.

**Mega Venusaur**: Mega Venusaur is also a nice Pokemon to check both Politoed and rain teams as a whole, despite rain limiting its recovery. Mega Venusaur does need to watch out for Choice Specs-boosted Psychic, as that is a clean 2HKO, and also needs to be aware that rain teams commonly carry Hurricane users like Tornadus-T.

**Other Common Rain Stops**: Checking Politoed isn't a big deal, but checking rain teams as a whole is. Latias, Latios, Celebi, and Rotom-W are all great checks to both Politoed and rain teams. The former two have a nice typing that lets them wall Keldeo and Thundurus, while the latter two can take on Grass- and Electric-types while having STAB moves that can hit the majority of rain teams super effectively. Latias, Latios, and Celebi are hurt by a boosted Ice Beam from Politoed, however, while Rotom-W is severely crippled by Toxic.

**Other Weather Inducers**: Mega Charizard-Y, (Mega) Tyranitar, and Hippodown are all common weather inducers that can strip Politoed of its precious rain. They need to be careful, however, as they're all hit super effectively by Politoed's Water STAB, and Politoed can even use Rain Dance on a predicted switch to foil their plans in changing the weather.
