<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to lower target's Defense one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Acid is, like most low-power moves, completely useless competitively. If you want to lower the opponent's Defense, Screech is easily better. For a more powerful Poison-type move, Sludge is much more powerful. Don't bother using it, ever.</p>
