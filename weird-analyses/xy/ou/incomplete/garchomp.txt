
Overview
########

    Excellent STAB typing and high attack allow it to hit hard
    Good user of Stealth Rock, it is rather fast and has respectable bulk
    Good set up sweeper as it can utilize different items efficiently to set up and sweep
    Unique 102 base Speed allows it to outpace certain important threats though still being outsped by Pokeon such as Keldeo, Gengar, and Thundurus-I
    Mega Evolution can run a mixed set to more success than Chainchomp in previous gens


SET NAME
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 4: Fire Fang / Stone Edge
ability: Rough Skin
item: Yache Berry / Garchompite
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Swords Dance helps Garchomp sweep defensive teams when given the opportunity to set up
    Earthquake is the primary attack and STAB move, allows it to hit Pokemon such as Aegislash and Heatran hard
    Outrage is the secondary STAB attack, allows it to hit many Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake such as Rotom-W, Aegislash, Landorus, Thundurus, and Gyarados.
    Dragon Claw can be considered over Outrage if being locked into Outrage is concerning -- such as in the case of Fairy-type Pokemon on the opponent's team
    Fire Fang helps Garchomp take down Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory easier
    Stone Edge can be used over Fire Fang if one wishes to hit Togekiss, as it would otherwise be immune to both of Garchomp's STAB moves.
    You can also consider running Substitute in the last slot. You lose the ability to beat things like Skarmory but Dragon- and Ground-type coverage is still decent, and you have more safety against faster threats


Set Details
========

    EVs maximize Speed and Attack, max speed allows it to beat Pokemon such as Landorus-I and Thundurus-T with a Jolly nature, as well as others below 101 base Speed such as Jirachi, Volcarona, Celebi, and Kyurem-B
    Yache Berry helps it survive Ice-type attacks from faster Pokemon such as Starmie, Greninja, and Keldeo, giving Garchomp the opportunity to survive a hit and attack back.
    Garchompite can be used on teams with Sandstorm support, and hits noticeably harder than the standard Yache set due to Sand Force and the base Attack boost.
    The additional bulk gives it the ability to survive priority attacks from Scizor or Breloom better, but the drop in Speed makes it lose to anything base 92 Speed and above
    Other berries can be used in place of Yache Berry: Lum helps it against random Scald burns, Will-o-Wisp users, and Toxic users, Haban berry helps it survive against certain variants of Latias and Latios
    Life Orb can be used to secure the kill on Pokemon like Gliscor and Landorus-T with Outrage. It hates the recoil but makes it even more threatening


Usage Tips
========

    Like most set up sweepers, it is best to save this type of Garchomp mid-late game so its checks and counters are weakened for the most part
    Switch it in safely on defensive teams, and Swords Dance on a predicted switch. This strategy can be used for Pokemon such as defensive Excadrill, Heatran, and even Pokemon like Ferrothorn to an extent.
    If running Lum Berry, you also have opportunities to set up Swords Dance on a status move such as Will-o-Wisp and Toxic. This is also helpful against Scald users like Jellicent
    Be wary of using Outrage if there is still a Fairy-type on the opponent's team, as you could potentially be giving them a free turn if you use Outrage too early


Team Options
========

    Best used on offensive teams, as Swords Dance has great wall-breaking potential and can apply offensive pressure in a pinch
    Thundurus-I makes a good partner because it can deal with Skarmory very easily, and also can utilize Prankster Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats for Garchomp to sweep through such as Latios, Keldeo, and Infernape
    Rotom-W can also threaten Skarmory, and can switch into Ice-type attacks from Pokemon like Starmie or Mamoswine
    Offensive Heatran can deal with Swords Dance Mega Mawile with Will-o-Wisp, can lay down Stealth Rock, and can threaten Ferrothorn and opposing switch-ins with Fire Blast
    If using Mega Garchomp, Smooth Rock Tyranitar and Hippowdon are important for keeping the Sand Force boost for Garchomp

SET NAME
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 4: Swords Dance / Fire Blast
ability: Rough Skin
item: Lum Berry / Focus Sash
nature: Jolly / Naive
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Garchomp is a good user of Stealth Rock because it can force switches from Pokemon like Heatran and Aegislash, then set up Stealth Rock
    Earthquake is primary STAB and gives Garchomp some offensive presence
    Outrage is used to round out Garchomp's coverage by hitting the Levitate users, Flying-types, and Ground-type resistant Pokemon
    Dragon Claw can be used if one does not wish to be locked into Outrage, though the damage output is noticeably weaker
    Swords Dance gives Garchomp extra sweeping capabilities if it is still around late game, and makes Garchomp an additional threat to the opponent's team
    Fire Blast can be used to hit Ferrothorn, Skarmory and Forretress harder, though Garchomp trades coverage for sweeping capabilities


Set Details
========

    Jolly nature with max Attack and Speed allow it to outspeed anything base 101 and below, Garchomp wants to hit as fast as hard as possible
    In the case of Fire Blast, Naive is used so there is no drop in damage
    Lum Berry is useful for both setting up Stealth Rock and sweeping, as Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock during a Toxic or Will-o-Wisp, or it can utilize Lum Berry to set up Swords Dance
    Focus Sash can be used so Garchomp functions more like a suicide lead. It can set up Stealth Rock against Pokemon like Starmie, Latias, and Latios. Or, it can simply choose to kill those threats instead
    Rocky Helmet is also an item to consider which is pretty useful against weaker U-turns, Aegislash Shadow Sneaks, or Talonflame Flare Blitzes in order to rack up more residual damage in tandem with Rough Skin

Usage Tips
========

    Unlike the Swords Dance set, this Garchomp is best used early game to get Stealth Rock up early
    As such, it is very common for this Garchomp to be used as a lead
    This Garchomp is more efficient at weakening things early game as opposed to flat-out sweeping with Swords Dance
    By weakening the opponent's team, cleanup sweepers can come in late game and finish up


Team Options
========

    Gengar, Talonflame, Starmie are all decent options to consider to aid in a late-game cleanup in combination with Garchomp, as they are all able to take down physically bulky threats with ease
    Ferrothorn and Forretress can make good entry hazard combinations with Garchomp because they can set up Spikes while luring in things like Heatran, which Garchomp can switch into
    Similarly, Garchomp can bring in Pokemon like Gliscor, Skarmory, and Hippowdon, which both Ferrothorn and Forretress can spikestack on

SET NAME
########
name: Mixed
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Draco Meteor
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Stone Edge
ability: Rough Skin
item: Garchompite
nature: Naughty
evs: 224 Atk / 32 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Earthquake gets a nice attack boost with Sand Force, and hits extremely hard with Mega Garchomp's boosted offenses
    Draco Meteor is used to hit common switch-ins such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon, putting them in a 2HKO range with Stealth Rock up.
    Fire Blast takes advantage of Mega Garchomp's mixed capabilities, being able to hit Skarmory and Ferrothorn much harder than usual because it is a specially based attack
    Stone Edge completes Mega Garchomp's coverage, allowing it to hit Togekiss. Furthermore, Stone Edge gets a nice boost from Sand Force


Set Details
========

    Naughty nature is used for maximum mixed damage output, as it can dent many bulky teams easily with Earthquake and Draco Meteor
    32 Special Attack EVs allow for Garchomp to 2HKO the standard Hippowdon with Draco Meteor and Earthquake under Sand
    Max Speed EVs let Garchomp hit 283, capable of outspeeding all Heatran and Adamant Lucario, as well as most bulky Rotom-W sets.
    However, it is outsped by max Speed Gyarados, max Speed Rotom-W, and Kyurem-B


Usage Tips
========

    This set is best used to take down slower, defensive teams
    Best used early-mid game to take down walls
    Should be brought in safely with a U-turn or a double switch
    Hit and run with this set. Stay in and fire off attacks accordingly, then switch out

Team Options
========

    Sandstorm support is highly recommended, so Smooth Rock Tyranitar or Hippowdon are common teammates to use. They can also set up Stealth Rock to help Mega Garchomp break down defenses
    Sand Rush Excadrill helps clean up in Sandstorm and can use Rapid Spin if need be to keep Garchomp healthy
    Swords Dance Aegislash can take advantage of weakened physical walls and can clean up lategame with Shadow Sneak as well
    Choice Band Azumarill is also a good teammate as it benefits off of Garchomp's wall-breaking abilities and has Aqua Jet to finish up late game


Other Options
########

    A Band set can be used for some instant offense and pure physical power
    Toxic could be used to cripple incoming Hippowdon or Landorus switches
    If used on rain, Aqua Tail can be considered on the Swords Dance set to hit Landorus, Gliscor, and Hippowdon harder
    A Scarf set can be used to revenge kill certain threats -- this would be used more as a clean up sweeper as opposed to a wall-breaking type of sweeper
    Substitute in tandem with Swords Dance can be considered as well, but the lack of coverage hurts its ability to sweep. It can be utilized with Salac Berry to outspeed the majority of the metagame
