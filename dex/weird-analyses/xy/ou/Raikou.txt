Raikou Skeleton

Overview
########
- High Speed and Special Attack make Raikou a threatening offensive Pokemon.
- With an Assault Vest, it counters top threat Thundurus and can handle Pokemon such as Greninja and Aegislash.
- It also works as a threatening sweeper with SubCM.
- Poor physical bulk and no way to hit Excadrill, and most other bulky Ground-types, for significant damage hinders it.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Shadow Ball
item: Assault Vest
evs: 252 SpA / 32 SpD / 224 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

- Thunderbolt is a reliable STAB for Raikou that has the most output and allows it to deal significant damage to threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Keldeo.
- Volt Switch gives Raikou a safe move with which ot pivot around.
- Hidden Power Ice hits Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp, which are otherwise significant threats to Raikou, for 4x super effective damage.
- Shadow Ball is mainly filler, but has uses in 2HKOing Latios and dealing the most damage to Aegislash, Latias, and incoming Excadrill.

Set Details
========

- The EVs provide enough Speed to outrun Thundurus and hit as hard as possible, with the rest in Special Defense so that Raikou takes special hits a bit better.
- Enough Speed can be run to tie Starmie, but it isn't common enough for that to be worth it.

Usage Tips
========

- You should not be switching in over and over with this, as it will easily get worn down.
- When in doubt, Volt Switch out. Well, unless the opponent has a Ground-type that might come in. In that case, it's usually best to go for Hidden Power Ice or Shadow Ball to get some damage off.

Team Options
========

- Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mandibuzz that can handle Ground-types and physical attackers in general are useful teammates.
- Hazards limit this Raikou's longevity immenesely due to its lack of Leftovers, so Defog support from the aforementioned Mandibuzz or Skarmory, or Rapid Spin support from Excadrill, is very helpful.
- Works well with partners that also use U-turn or Volt Switch.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Substitute / Volt Switch
item: Leftovers
evs: 32 HP / 252 SpA / 224 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

- Calm Mind boosts Raikou's Special Attack so it can sweep, while allowing it to take special hits very well.
- Thunderbolt is the main STAB attack that deals the most damage in general.
- Hidden Power Ice hits Ground- and Dragon-types (except Mamoswine and Kyurem-B) that would otherwise wall Raikou.
- Substitute protects Raikou from status and revenge kills.
- Or, Volt Switch can be used to allow Raikou to pivot around and be useful throughout the game.

Set Details
========

- The Special Attack and Speed EVs give Raikou enough Speed to outrun Thundurus and allow it to hit as hard as possible.
- The rest is dumped into HP to give Raikou a little extra bulk.

Usage Tips
========

- This thing sets up on Thundurus and Toxic Aegislash, two of the biggest threats in OU.
- Don't try and set up until Raikou's counters have been removed. It's not worth it.
- If you choose to run Volt Switch, use it to pivot around throughout the match. Just make sure Raikou doesn't take too much damage, such that it can be revenge killed by priority.

Team Options
========

- Pokemon to take out pesky Excadrill, specially defensive Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Choice Scarf Garchomp are heavily appreciated. Offensive Water-types&mdash;such as Keldeo, Manaphy, and Greninja&mdash;and Life Orb Deoxys-S are standout options.
- Defog or Rapid Spin support is necessary if you choose to run Volt Switch, as Raikou incurring too much residual damage is never a good idea.
- Pokemon like the aforementioned Keldeo as well as Terrakion and other powerful physical attackers make good partners to take out Chansey, which hard walls it.

Other Options
########

- A Choice Specs set can be used to hit hard and pivot around with Volt Switch.
- Aura Sphere with the event-locked Rash Nature can work on a Choice Scarf set.

Checks and Counters
########

**Ground-types**: Basically, Mamoswine, Excadrill, Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Gastrodon. Choice Scarf Garchomp and Landorus-T are 4x weak to Ice, but can outspeed and OHKO it.

**Physical attackers that aren't hit super effectively by Thunderbolt**: Raikou's disappointing physical bulk means hard-hitting physical attackers, such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, can handle it easily.

**Special walls**: Unaware Clefable stops Calm Mind Raikou dead in its track. Additionally, Sylveon, Chansey, and a host of other special attackers threaten it.

**Entry hazards and status**: Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic, and burn severely limit Assault Vest Raikou's longevity and general ability to last throughout the battle.
