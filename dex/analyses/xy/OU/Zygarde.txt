Overview
########
- Often ridiculed due to its low stats for a legendary, and dismissed as an 'inferior Garchomp'
- It has very well-placed stats, boasting great bulk, decent power, and usable speed
- Powerful STAB combination
- It has great boosting options in Dragon Dance and Coil
- Solid offensive movepool allows it to threaten a majority of opponents, while also possessing Extreme Speed
- It lacks immediate power compared to its fellow Dragons
- Useless ability
- Does not have a reliable Dragon-type attack, which limits its sweeping prowess
- It takes a tad longer for Zygarde to be a threat opposed to other Dragons, but does not make it any less of one

SubCoil
########
name: SubCoil
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Coil
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Dragon Tail
ability: Aura Break
item: Leftovers
nature: Careful
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD

Moves
========
- Substitute blocks status, as well as various weaker attacks
- Coil boosts Zygarde's Attack, Defense, and accuracy, which ensures a perfectly accurate Dragon Tail
- Earthquake is Zygarde's most reliable attack
- Dragon Tail prevents slower phazers from phazing Zygarde's Substitute, hits airborne Pokemon, and forces out unfavorable matchups or opposing stat boosters

Set Details
========
- Max HP provides 105 HP Substitutes, enough to take 2 Seismic Tosses
- Maximum Special Defense prevents attacks such as Mega-Venusaur's Giga Drain and Vaporeon's Scald from breaking the Substitute
- Coil makes up for Defense
- 0 Attack EVs ensures STAB Foul Play will not break the Substitute, so the remaining EVs go into Defense
- Leftovers is essential to recover health lost from Substitute

Team Options
========
- SubCoil Zygarde has an almost unfair advantage against defensive teams
- Set up a Substitute against the many foes unable to break it, then boost away
- Dragon Tail any problematic Pokemon behind the safety of the Substitute to drag out the opponent's setup fodder again; repeated attempts will easily wear down the opponent's Zygarde check(s)
- Specially based Fairy-types, especially Unaware Clefable and Togekiss, can pose a problem due to their immunity to Dragon Tail, so Pokemon that can threaten them make good partners: Aegislash, Scizor, Charizard-Y, and Mega-Venusaur are such options
- Draco Meteor and Ice Beam are two special attacks Zygarde fears greatly, so Pokemon that can take one or preferably both of these moves make great partners; Azumarill, Sylveon, Aegislash and Scizor come to mind
- Teammates should pick up the slack against offensive teams which do not provide Zygarde an opportunity to set up
- Pokemon that can spread paralysis can slow down offensive Pokemon so they too fall victim to Zygarde, so Klefki and Thundurus-I make good partners; Klefki even provides Spikes for Zygarde's Dragon Tail
- VoltTurn users such as Talonflame and Thundurus can easily harass offensive teams, but slower users such as Scizor and Rotom-W can instead try to bring Zygarde in safely

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Outrage
move 4: Stone Edge / Extreme Speed
ability: Aura Break
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Dragon Dance boosts Attack and Speed, preparing Zygarde for the sweep
- Earthquake provides solid damage with no drawbacks, making it Zygarde's most reliable attack and premier sweeping move
- Outrage hits crazy hard after a single boost, but locks you in and confuses you afterward
- Stone Edge hits Togekiss, and picks off Flying-types such as Thundurus and Tornadus without resorting to Outrage
- Extreme Speed outpaces opposing priority, most notably that of Talonflame and Mamoswine, though their inability to OHKO means Extreme Speed isn't too necessary

Set Details
========
- Maximum Attack power with Adamant for greater sweeping potential after a single Dragon Dance
- Maximum Speed ties with neutral natured Kyurem-B, and also outspeeds neutral natured Mega Garchomp and Landorus-T as well as Jolly Gyarados
- Jolly with 164 Speed EVs outruns Mega Alakazam and Mega Aerodactyl at +1, though the lack of an Attack-boosting nature substantially drops Zygarde's power
- Remaining EVs go into HP
- Lum Berry allows Zygarde to set up on status users, such as Rotom-W, Trevenant, and Gliscor, while also snapping Zygarde out of Outrage confusion
- Life Orb gives Zygarde a significant power boost, since its base Attack is not as good as other Dragons

Usage Tips
========
- Dragon Dance Zygarde's greatest advantage over Dragonite is its resistance to Stealth Rock as opposed to weakness, lessening the need for hazard removal
- Between the boosted speed, high bulk, and powerful STAB combination, Dragon Dance Zygarde can pose a serious threat to offensive teams
- Zygarde should be set to sweep after one Dragon Dance, cleaning up with speedy and powerful Earthquakes or Outrages
- If possible, eliminate or weaken Ground resistant / immune Pokemon before going for the sweep, so as to avoid being forced into using Outrage early
- Extreme Speed lets Zygarde perform the occasional revenge kill
- Zygarde uses its good bulk or resistances to tank a hit and set up, or threatens foes with STAB Earthquake to gain free turns
- If Life Orb is used, take care not to let Zygarde's health drop too low

Team Options
========
- Rotom-W is a great partner regardless of the coverage option; it takes on Togekiss for Zygardes that lack Stone Edge, and can handle Talonflame and Mamoswine for Zygardes without Extreme Speed
- Magnezone traps Skarmory, which will otherwise be a royal pain for Zygarde to overcome
- While Stealth Rock benefits any offensive Pokemon, it is especially helpful for Zygarde since it weakens a good majority of Ground-resists, which may allow Zygarde to pick them off with its weaker move as opposed to using Outrage to KO them
- Zygarde finds it easier to set up on opponents weak to Ground-type moves; Tornadus-T lures in Rock-types or Steel-types such as Heatran and Tyranitar and U-turns away from them, even a Sylveon's dry Baton Pass can be used for the same effect
- Dual Screens aren't necessary, but eases Zygarde's job of setting up, while its natural bulk makes it even more challenging to take down behind Screens; Klefki and Deoxys are such candidates

Parashuffler
########
name: Parashuffler
move 1: Glare
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Dragon Tail
move 4: Substitute
ability: Aura Break
item: Leftovers
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

Moves
========
- Glare paralyzes everything Thunder Wave does, plus Ground-types as well
- Earthquake is Zygarde's most reliable STAB move, and targets grounded Electric-types which cannot be paralyzed
- Dragon Tail phazes out foes, bringing out new opponents for Zygarde to paralyze
- Substitute is used to take advantage of the free turns paralyzed foes give, especially those that keep switching in not wanting their teammates to also be paralyzed, while also guarding against status

Set Details
========
- Since Zygarde cannot boost its Defense with Coil anymore, Defense is maxed out to tank physical foes
- Zygarde's impressive physical bulk lets it serve as an emergency check to a huge variety of physical attackers, such as Mega-Pinsir, Talonflame, Landorus-T, and Terrakion, as well as unboosted foes such as Garchomp, Gyarados, and even Mega Charizard X, which Zygarde can paralyze or phaze
- Max HP and Defense for absolute physical bulk
- Remaining placed into Special Defense

Usage Tips
========
- Paralyze everything, Earthquake Electric-types
- Substitute against status users so they do not impede your job and shorten your staying power
- Dragon Tail paralyzed opponents so you can drag in new foes to Glare
- If the opponent persists in repeatedly sending out their already paralyzed Pokemon, take advantage with Dragon Tail or Substitute on the switch, or spamming Substitute until they are fully paralyzed

Team Options
========
- Attackers that have trouble outspeeding opponents, such as Mega-Heracross and Bisharp, greatly appreciate Zygarde's paralysis support
- This set's performance is greatly enhanced by entry hazards, as it forces a lot of switches
- Klefki, Forretress, Ferrothorn and Skarmory offers Spikes while covering Zygarde's weaknesses; Tyranitar provides Stealth Rock and can take advantage of paralyzed foes
- Rotom-W, Thundurus and Gliscor are immune to both paralysis and Earthquake, making them a big annoyance; Mega Venusaur and Kyurem-B can handle all three for the most part, though Kyurem-B does stack weaknesses

Other Options
########
- Camouflage for weakness removal and STAB Extreme Speed, but Dragon Dance and Coil gives Extreme Speed the same boost and powers up Zygarde's other moves
- Land's Wrath < Earthquake
- Haze, but Zygarde lacks the tools or offensive presence to deter most foes from setting up again, plus it has Dragon Tail
- RestTalk + Dragon Tail, but Hippowdon would make a better bulky phaser while having moveslots to spare

Checks & Counters
########
- Zygarde thrives on setting up, so disrupting it from doing so is a good way to keep it under control, though phasing may not be the solution
- Unaware Clefable and Quagsire stop Zygarde cold, the latter of which threatens with STAB Moonblast
- Taunt can prevent Zygarde from doing much more
- Status, especially burns, will heavily cripple Zygarde, though Substitute coupled with Zygarde's speed can make it difficult; Gliscor and Rotom-W with some speed investment are one of the few status users that can outpace Zygarde
- Togekiss only really fears Stone Edge
- Sylveon's Hyper Voice, Icicle Spear, and Infiltrator Noivern bust through Zygarde's Substitute
- Skarmory does not mind repeatedly switching in and being phased by Dragon Tails due to its resistance, high Defense, and Roost, eventually outstalling Dragon Tail PP
- Bulky Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Skarmory can stop Dragon Dance sets
- Ice-type attacks, though Extreme Speed outpaces even Ice Shard
