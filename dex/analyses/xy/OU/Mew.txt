Overview
########

With access to every single TM, HM, and tutor move in the game, Mew is a top contender for the title of the most versatile Pokemon. The Defog buff gave it the niche of being one of the few users of the move that isn't weak to Stealth Rock. Mew is also the only relevant Defog user with access to Will-O-Wisp, which allows it to negate the Attack boost provided to several Defiant users by Defog.

However, none of Mew's stats are particularly good by OU standards; its offensive stats are only above average without a boost and its Speed leaves it outsped by many threats. Its average defensive typing leaves it weak to common attacking types, such as Bug, Dark, and Ghost, with little neutralities to boast for itself. Because of these problems, and despite Mew's monumental menu of moves, it can only run a couple of viable sets without being outclassed. When Mew does its few jobs, however, it does them exceptionally well, and opponents would be foolish to let their guard down against it.

Stallbreaker
########
name: Stallbreaker
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Soft-Boiled
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Knock Off / Night Shade
ability: Synchronize
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 136 SpD / 120 Spe
nature: Careful / Calm

Moves
========
This set makes Mew one of the best stallbreakers in the game. Taunt and Will-O-Wisp allow Mew to dismantle many stall cores, especially those involving Mega Venusaur, Skarmory, Blissey, and Chansey. Soft-Boiled provides Mew with reliable recovery. Knock Off is another great stallbreaking tool and rids opposing walls of their precious Leftovers or Eviolite. Night Shade is another good option and allows Mew to deal consistent damage to any Pokemon that isn't Normal-type. Other coverage moves can be considered to hit Mew's typical checks and counters. For example, Ice Beam can be used if your team has problems with Landorus, as Mew can take a hit and OHKO 87.5% of the time. Earth Power and Aura Sphere also allow Mew to better handle Steel- and Fire-types, such as Heatran and Aegislash, though without investment, all the aforementioned moves aren't particularly powerful. 

Set Details
========
The Speed EVs allow Mew to outspeed Jolly Mega Tyranitar and everything slower. The rest of the EVs are invested in HP and Special Defense to make Mew as specially bulky as possible. The nature further boosts Mew's Special Defense. Careful is preferred if using Knock Off, but otherwise Calm is better to minimize Foul Play damage. A specially defensive spread is used as most Pokemon on stall teams these days use special attacks, which allows Mew to wall them even better. Leftovers provides passive recovery.

Usage Tips
========
This set single-handedly dismantles many stall cores, such as the famous SkarmBliss. Use it if your team needs a utility Pokemon that can also threaten stall. Don't use it as a wall, as its bulk is nothing to write home about, even after investment. Always try to keep Mew as healthy as possible, as it may have to frequently switch in and out. Never try to keep Mew on a Pokemon that might potentially carry a status move unless you have a cleric in your team. Be wary of using Will-O-Wisp if your opponent has a Fire-type, as it may give them a free switch-in. If your opponent sends in a cleric, Taunt it as soon as possible. If you are using Knock Off, spam it as often as you can. Against offensive teams, Mew can spread burns easily and can give one of your sweepers easy setup opportunities.

Team Options
========
Mew can wear down common stall Pokemon so that your sweepers can break past them. It can spread burns quite well, thus crippling many physical attackers. A burned Pokemon also makes for good setup fodder for your own sweepers. Mew hates status, so a cleric or a status absorber makes for a very good teammate. Sylveon and Clefable are good options for a cleric, as they have good synergy with Mew and can also check Conkelldurr, who loves to switch into Will-O-Wisp to activate Guts. RestTalk Gyarados is a good status absorber and also checks both formes of Mega Charizard, which can switch into Mew quite easily. Mew also appreciates teammates that can take on common Pursuit users such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Aegislash. Hippowdon and Mega Scizor are good examples of teammates that can easily beat the aforementioned Pursuit trappers. Something that can switch into Heatran, such as Rotom-W and Conkeldurr, is also appreciated.

Entry Hazard Control
########
name: Entry Hazard Control
move 1: Defog
move 2: Soft-Boiled
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Taunt / Stealth Rock
ability: Synchronize
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 136 SpD / 120 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========
Defog is the main move on this set, removing entry hazards on both sides of the field. Soft-Boiled provides recovery, allowing Mew to clear entry hazards throughout the game. Will-O-Wisp can burn the opposing Pokemon, slowly wearing them out and and crippling most physical attackers. Will-O-Wisp nullifies the Attack boost that Defiant users like Bisharp might get from switching into Defog. Taunt prevents Mew from becoming complete setup bait. It is also very useful against opposing support Pokemon, as Mew is generally faster than most of them. Stealth Rock can be used if your team lacks a setter. Mew can use Stealth Rock after Defog, ensuring that Stealth Rock is only up on the opponent's side of the field.

Set Details
========
The Speed EVs allow Mew to outspeed max Speed Jolly Mega Tyranitar and burn it before it can set up Dragon Dance or use Crunch on Mew. The rest is invested in HP and Special Defense to make Mew as specially bulky as possible. A Calm nature further boosts Mew's Special Defense. A specially defensive spread is used, as most of the wallbreakers in OU are specially oriented. Moreover, most of the Pokemon on stall teams are specially oriented, and this set acts as a very good stallbreaker. Leftovers is the item of choice and provides passive recovery. 0 Attack IVs minimize confusion and Foul Play damage.

Usage Tips
========
This set works best on bulky offense and balanced teams. Mew can switch in on many defensive Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Chansey, Taunt them, and then use Defog. If the opponent has a Defiant user, it is generally better to not use Defog immediately. Will-O-Wisp is the better option in this case. Try to keep Mew at high health if the opponent's entry hazard setters have not been KOed yet. Don't use Mew as a wall; just use it as an utility Pokemon who can use Defog and stallbreak for your team. Don't bring it in on strong unresisted STAB moves, as its bulk is not spectacular and it will get worn down fast.

Team Options
========
Pokemon which appreciate the removal of entry hazards from their side of field, such as Charizard, Talonflame, Dragonite, Pinsir, and Kyurem-B, are good teammates. Mew appreciates teammates that can deal with strong Pursuit users such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Aegislash. Hippowdon and Scizor can easily handle the aforementioned Pursuit trappers. Unaware Quagsire is a good teammate as it counters Defiant users. A Pokemon to take on Mega Charizard is needed as Mew can't do anything against either forme. Heatran is a good option as is RestTalk Gyarados. Mew appreciates cleric support as poison and burn ruin its bulk and force it to frequently waste turns by using Soft-Boiled. If you can't pack a cleric, a status absorber can work too. Again, RestTalk Gyarados is a good candidate.

Other Options
########

Due to its huge movepool, Mew has no lack of options. It can use both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot to good effect; however, it is let down by its mediocre Speed and four moveslot syndrome. Mew can also use a Choice set to grab surprise revenge kills, but its main selling point is its versatility, and it isn't an exceptionally good user as it lacks powerful and spammable STAB. Mew is one of the only Pokemon that can use Transform somewhat reliably due to its above-average bulk. A lead set with Taunt, Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and Explosion can also work quite well, but it is somewhat outclassed in this role by the Deoxys formes. Mew can also run a Baton Pass set with either Nasty Plot or Swords Dance and Rock Polish, which can be devastating to unprepared teams. Baton Pass can be used on any set to bypass Pursuit, provided that Mew is faster, although Pursuit is typically not a problem because of Will-O-Wisp.

Checks & Counters
########

**Heatran**: Heatran sponges anything that the support sets can throw at it, although if Mew is running an offensive set with super effective coverage moves, the latter can win in an one-on-one situation.

**Prankster and Faster Taunt Users**: Prankster Taunt users such as Sableye and Thundurus and faster Taunt users like Deoxys-D can shut down the support sets easily.

**Pursuit Trappers**: Strong Pursuit users can put Mew in a checkmate situation, but they must be wary of Will-O-Wisp.

**Charizard**: Mega Charizard X can Dragon Dance on Mew and proceed to sweep its team while Mega Charizard Y switches into Mew easily and can fire off sun-boosted Fire Blasts.

**Status**: Burn and poison ruin Mew's bulk by whittling down its HP and slowly wearing it out.

**Bisharp**: Bisharp can switch into Defog, get a Defiant boost, and sweep Mew's team, although it should be wary of Will-O-Wisp.

**Strong Special Attackers**: Strong special attackers, such as Mega Charizard Y and Choice Specs Keldeo, can easily 2HKO Mew and don't fear Will-O-Wisp.
