<p>Welcome to Team STINKY MUSIC! This is my most successful Little  Cup team to date and probably my most edited too (x_x). Anyways, this  really is a gimmicky team, carrying five Life Orbs and one Choice Scarf.  Most notably, it doesn't have a single Oran Berry. This is all-out  offense, attempting to kill everything with a wide variety of sweepers. I  can say personally that I have never used anything like this team, nor  seen anything like it. While almost all of the sets are standard, I  haven't ever used a team without a single Oran Berry. I used this team  with a new alt and got to second (asdf still no LC #1 ranking for me  ;_;).
Anyways, here's Team STINKY MUSIC!</p>

<p>(By the way, this is a joint team with Elevator Music; he just  was busy with school, so I used this team. The name is due to him and  the team being based around Stunky.)</p>

Omanyte @ Life Orb<br />
Swift Swim<br />
Modest<br />
236 HP / 36 SpA / 236 Spe<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- AncientPower<br />
- Ice Beam / Spikes<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Omanyte is best described as an "accident". We originally had  Omanyte to counter SubDour, which really threatened Stunky. However, EM  felt we had a weakness to Scarf Machop, so we moved Omanyte to the lead  slot and put a Ghost in the last slot. The Ghost has since been taken  out and we are somewhat ScarfChop weak, but that's irrevelant. Well, we  ran calcs and realized that Omanyte could OHKO Machop with LO Hydro  Pump. Since there had been a absolute boom in Machop leads during that  period, we decided to run Omanyte. I certainly haven't regretted it, as  Omanyte is one of the best leads I've run. Here's how it fares against  the top ten leads (from July x_x):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Machop</strong>: OHKO with Hydro Pump. No  one runs max speed Machop/ScarfChop as a lead, and no one expects  Omanyte to run Life Orb and OHKO, so we're safe here.</li>
<li><strong>Snover</strong>: OHKO with AncientPower.  If it's Scarf, then go to Gligar after Omanyte dies, U-turn and then  switch to Stunky to finish it off. Sash is the same except skip going to  Gligar. Oran variants/other variants are OHKOed.</li>
<li><strong>Meowth</strong>: It can't do anything  except Seed Bomb which is semi-rare and Hydro Pump is an  OHKO.</li>
<li><strong>Kabuto</strong>: Hydro Pump it down to its  sash, then finish it off. Waterfall is only a 3HKO. Earth Power  variants are troublesome (but rare).</li>
<li><strong>Aipom</strong>: Same thing as Meowth. The  spread survives LO Fake Out + Brick Break while OHKOing back with Hydro  Pump.</li>
<li><strong>Hippopotas</strong>: OHKO with Hydro Pump.</li>
<li><strong>Abra</strong>: OHKO with Hydro Pump,  though most of these will usually screen first turn. I haven't seen many  of them though.</li>
<li><strong>Diglett</strong>: Omanyte is screwed. Use  Ice Beam in case it decides to Stealth Rock. Otherwise, go to Gligar and  U-turn then deal with it from there.</li>
<li><strong>Gastly</strong>: Scarf variants are OHKOed  by Hydro Pump, though most usually run Thunderbolt or Energy Ball.  Trick Room is taken down to its sash and then revenged by  Stunky.</li>
<li><strong>Chimchar</strong>: This is a really  troublesome lead. When I had Mantyke, I'd usually take the Fake Out with  Omanyte and go to Mantyke on the HP Grass. But now, I usually just  sacrifice Omanyte, U-turn with Gligar to break its sash and go to  Stunky/Staryu from there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hydro Pump is sheer power. Due to Omanyte usually killing  leads, I ran Stealth Rock in case I had a chance to set it up (which I  usually did). Ice Beam and AncientPower are coverage moves for hitting  Dragons and Snover. I've considered running Spikes over Ice Beam, as  Spikes would really help this team out and it really doesn't fear DDTini  due to Scarf Gligar. From what I've seen though, there really isn't any  time to set up Spikes and Ice Beam is generally the superior  option.</p>

Stunky @ Life Orb<br />
Aftermath<br />
Jolly<br />
12 HP / 252 Atk / 244 Spe<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Hidden Power Ground</p>

<p>Stunky was what EM wanted to base the team around. At the  beginning I was skeptical, but Stunky is the team's MVP by far. Having a  powerful Crunch and Sucker Punch is incredibly helpful, being able to  take down threats like Staryu and Taillow. It also is the team's general  revenge killer. I guess Hidden Power Ground is random, but I laugh so  hard every time someone tries to switch in Aron on Stunky. I can't say  anything about Explo- KABOOOOOOOM. Taking out Houndour, Carvanha, and  opposing Stunky is amazing and a great momentum-swinger for this team,  who greatly appreciates the free switch. Seriously, people need to use  Stunky more. Even killing silly Scarf Gligar users with Crunch + Sucker  Punch is fun. All in all, Stunky is really good post-Misdreavus,  contrary to popular belief. I think it's because it doesn't have to run  Oran and Pursuit anymore.</p>

Gligar @ Choice Scarf<br />
Sand Veil<br />
Adamant<br />
236 Atk / 236 Spe<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Aqua Tail<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- U-turn</p>

<p>Scarf Gligar is the glue of this team. Without it I'd be  screwed over by a lot of things, Elekid, Diglett, and Taillow included.  U-turn's free switch is also invaluable for this team, as there aren't  that many immunites to switch in on. Being able to scout is also great.  For some reason, people like bringing Gastly in on Gligar only to get  U-turned. Stunky can then get the kill on Gastly or a free Crunch on the  switch-in. Aqua Tail and Stone Edge handle stuff like opposing Gligar  and Taillow, but I generally dislike locking myself into those moves  earlygame due to a free set-up being possible. Normally, I identify  myself as Scarf early. This usually causes my opponent to switch when I  switch Gligar into their Elekid (for example) even though I usually will  U-turn. Occasionally, I will go for the kill, but only after seeing  that there are no more set-up Pokemon on the opponent's team that are  immune to the attack of choice. Gligar is usually the Pokemon I save  till the end because Scarf Gligar beats almost everything one on  one.</p>

Chinchou @ Life Orb<br />
Volt Absorb<br />
Modest<br />
58 Def / 228 SpA / 220 Spe<br />
- Agility<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Ice Beam</p>

<p>This used to be Rain Dance Mantyke, but then I was disappointed  at having a weak Hidden Power Grass to hit other Water-types. The loss  of a Ground-immune Pokemon has kinda hurt this team, but the extra power  is amazing. Life Orb Agility Chinchou is incredibly strong. Having a  STAB Thunderbolt is very helpful to this team. While it certainly has a  somewhat hard time setting up, it can still work its magic against  non-HP Grass Staryu, non-HP Grass Chinchou, and even Elekid. I'm using  Ice Beam over Hidden Power Fire/Grass because opposing Chinchou really  can't do much to me and Snover is kinda rare, since it usually comes in  on Gligar, which promptly takes a huge chunk out of it with U-turn  before Stunky kills it.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/137.png" alt="" /><br />
Porygon @ Life Orb<br />
Trace<br />
Timid<br />
76 HP / 236 SpA / 196 Spe<br />
- Agility<br />
- Tri Attack<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Shadow Ball / Thunderbolt</p>

<p>Porygon is just too freaking strong. Even with a Timid nature,  it reaches 19 Special Attack and even higher with a Life Orb. While I  have missed the bulk from Oran Berry at some times, the sheer power is  enough to make me use it. It sets up on threats to this team like Scarf  Gastly locked into Shadow Ball, Scarf Chinchou locked into Thunderbolt,  and even Water Absorb Mantyke. People often think that the loss of  Download makes Porygon a lot worse. However, Trace is still an amazing  ability and actually gives Porygon a lot more situations to set up in.  It also is my Agility Chinchou check if I know the Chinchou has HP Grass  (which doesn't OHKO my Chinchou), as Porygon survives Hydro Pump and  delivers a huge blow with Tri Attack. Shadow Ball and Ice Beam are  coverage moves, the former hitting ghosts hard and the latter smashing  Gligar. I'm considering Thunderbolt over Shadow Ball since Ice Beam  OHKOs Gastly anyways and Aron has an easy set-up on Porygon. Other than  that, I've loved the switch to Porygon. It's also the best bot (see  #littlecup if you don't know!)</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/120.png" alt="" /><br />
Staryu @ Life Orb<br />
Trace<br />
Timid<br />
240 SpA / 240 Spe<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>When I was using this team, I found that the original lack of a  19 speeder was disturbing. I tried a Overheat/Flare Blitz/Return/Quick  Attack Ponyta, as Snover was becoming a problem for this team. However,  the weakness to Stealth Rock and the fact that Flare Blitz + Quick  Attack was illegal caused me to change to HP Fire Staryu. Staryu gets  great coverage with its four moves, basically only losing to Chinchou.  Nothing except Munchlax and Chinchou can safely switch into Staryu. Some  teams just aren't prepared for Staryu. They switch Wynaut into an Ice  Beam only to be promptly KOed by Hydro Pump without activating Oran.  Being able to kill SubGastly, tie with Taillow, Gligar, and opposing  Staryu, and generally hit like a truck is invaluable for this team. I'm  considering using HP Grass over HP Fire due to Snover not really facing  Staryu most of the time and Chinchou being annoying.</p>
</div>

<p>With the recent banning of Misdreavus, many people assumed  Stunky would fall off of the radar. Elevator Music and iss both decided  that this would be a great chance to use Stunky for its other niches and  to catch people off guard. This team is very unique&mdash;not only  because of Stunky, but because it is a team of 6 sweepers that attempt  to break down the opposing team's core and sweep. It doesn't even have a  single Pokemon with an Oran Berry!</p>

<p>Life Orb Omanyte starts off the team with a splash. Omanyte is  beaten by many leads, but the leads that it does beat are quite common.  Additionally, with Omanyte, switching in is almost impossible without  perfect prediction. Omanyte generally sets up Stealth Rock and weakens  the foe's special wall before it bites the dust. While Omanyte doesn't  always prevent Stealth Rock, it does get it up reliably. This is  actually fine for this type of offensive team, because it won't be doing  much switching, while the opponent will be switching constantly to  answer Team STINKY's many threats.</p>

<p>Next up is this team's star, Stunky. Stunky brings a Gastly  counter to the team as well as some invaluable priority. With Life Orb  and a decent Attack stat, Stunky makes for one of the best late game  cleaners and revenge killers. Hidden Power Ground allows Stunky to hit  opposing Dark-type resists without having to use Explosion, which should  be saved for Pokemon like Gligar. After Explosion opens up a hole for  Team STINKY, its onslaught of special sweepers can come in and hopefully  plow through the rest of the opponents team.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Gligar plays the role of a lure for Stunky with  U-turn as well as a revenge killer. It also gives Team STINKY a  Ground-type immunity, which is very crucial for Little Cup. Gligar is  also one of the best partners for Stunky because it beats Diglett and  Elekid, two Pokemon that would otherwise run rampant against this slow  team. He can also use his Gligar to check opposing Swords Dance Gligar,  which also give this team trouble. Gligar also has an important task in  checking Croagunk, who is a major nuisance to this team.</p>

<p>Chinchou is Elevator Music's and iss's first late-game sweeper.  It can come in on many special attackers and set up Agility. If Omanyte  did its job right, the opponent's special wall (likely Munchlax) should  be in Hydro Pump's KO range. Thunderbolt, Hydro Pump, and Ice Beam make  for an almost unresisted combination in Little Cup; in fact the only  Pokemon that resists all three is Chinchou itself. After an Agility,  Chinchou outpaces the whole metagame, including Choice Scarf Diglett.  This makes Chinchou a very big threat to the opponent right off the  bat.</p>

<p>Second is the best, and Porygon steps up to the plate as the  second special sweeper on Team STINKY. Porygon has been a dangerous  threat ever since the Pomeg glitch allowed the use of Tri Attack along  with two coverage moves backed by a high SpA stat. With its excellent  bulk, it finds the time to use Agility quite often. If the opponent's  Munchlax has taken prior damage, Porygon can muscle through the big blob  with Tri Attack. This helps out Team STINKY immensely, considering  Munchlax beats four of this team's six members as long as it has full  health.</p>

<p>Staryu is quite an underrated threat. With the opponent's team  weakened, Staryu can clean up the foe's team with its 19 Speed and great  coverage. With four attacking moves, the only Pokemon that can switch  into Staryu at all are Chinchou and Munchlax. As Elevator Music and iss  point out, not even Wynaut can safely switch into Life Orb Staryu.  Having a 19 Speed Pokemon is quite important for offensive teams,  because otherwise you run the risk of being swept by various Pokemon,  such as Carvanha, SubGastly, and other 19 Speed Pokemon.</p>

<p>This team obviously has its strengths, but unfortunately it has  trouble dealing with a number of threats. First and foremost, a  conservatively played Croagunk dismantles this team. It picks off each  of the sweepers one by one, and Gligar can't do much besides risking  getting hit by Ice Punch. Chinchou also hurts this team pretty badly,  since the only switch in that Team STINKY has is its own Chinchou, which  risks being KOed by Hidden Power Grass. Due to the special nature of  this team, Munchlax has a field day against it. It will almost assuredly  net at least one kill, if not more. It has high Attack, HP, and Special  Defense stats, meaning that it not only survives special attacks, but it  OHKOes the sweepers back most of the time. However, Munchlax can be  worn down and bypassed, meaning this team has very few weaknesses. It is  one of the most unique and clever teams in the late Little Cup  metagame.</p>
