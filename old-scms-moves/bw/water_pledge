Use with Fire Pledge and Grass Pledge for additional effect.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. If one of the user's allies chose to use Grass Pledge or Water Pledge this turn and has not moved yet, they take their turn immediately after the user and the user's move does nothing. Power triples if this move is used by an ally that way, and a rainbow appears on the user's side if the first move was Fire Pledge, which causes this Pokemon and its allies to have twice the chance of side-effects occurring, but this effect does not stack with Serene Grace. A swamp appears on the target's side if the first move was Grass Pledge which causes the Speed of all opponents to be reduced by 1/2. Does not consume Water Gem when used.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Water Pledge is fairly useless in singles play, as the Pokemon that have access to it have superior options such as Surf, Scald, or Hydro Pump. However, in doubles, it can be used together with Fire Pledge to double the effect chance of your side's moves (though this does not stack with Serene Grace). When used together with Grass Pledge, Water Pledge can also be used to slow down the opponent; this is helpful to assist slower Pokemon on teams that would rather not run Trick Room.</p>
