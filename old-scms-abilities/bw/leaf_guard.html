Prevents status effects in sun.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If sun is the prevailing weather condition, the wielder cannot be afflicted by status conditions. Leaf Guard also prevents drowsiness and the use of <a href="/bw/moves/rest">Rest</a> in sun. Leaf Guard will not cure previously existing status conditions when sun comes into effect.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Really, Leaf Guard is a situational ability that is generally worse than other options. <a href="/bw/pokemon/leafeon">Leafeon</a> gets it but would rather use <a href="/bw/abilities/chlorophyll">Chlorophyll</a>, and the same applies to <a href="/bw/pokemon/tangrowth">Tangrowth</a>, except it also gets <a href="/bw/abilities/regenerator">Regenerator</a>. Thus, it is pretty much the worst of the beneficial sun abilities.</p>
