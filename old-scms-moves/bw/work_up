<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack and Special Attack by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Work Up is a fine boosting move for some mixed attackers as it boosts both Attack and Special Attack. However, many of the best users of Work Up, such as Infernape, lose crucial coverage in order to use the move, and the move is generally ignored. Growth outclasses Work Up when used under sun as it raises both stats by two stages. Most often, Swords Dance and Nasty Plot are chosen over Work Up as mixed sweepers are sometimes easier to wall. Some +1 sweepers might be too weak to muscle their way through certain walls despite being a mixed attacker. However, one notable user of Work Up is Virizion. Virizion's good bulk and typing allows it to grab multiple boosts from Work Up, turning it into a great mixed sweeper.</p>
