[SHORT DESC]
User becomes invulnerable, then attacks the next turn. Nullifies Detect and Protect.

[LONG DESC]
<p>User becomes invulnerable, then attacks the next turn. If the target uses Detect or Protect, this move does normal damage, and the effects of Detect or Protect are nullified for the rest of the turn. However, the use of Detect or Protect still applies to the internal counter, meaning they still have half the chance to work the following turn.</p>
