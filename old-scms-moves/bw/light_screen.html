[SHORT DESC]
Doubles your team's Special Defense for 5 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For 5 turns, the user and its party members take 0.5x damage from special attacks, or 0.66x damage if in a double or triple battle. This is not treated as a stat change. Critical hits ignore this protection. It is removed from the user's side if the user or an ally is successfully hit by Brick Break or Defog. Brick Break will not cancel the effect if it fails to hit the target, or if it is used on a Ghost-type. Lasts for 8 turns if the user is holding Light Clay.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Dual screens is a popular strategy, and Light Screen can provide your team with a good amount of special bulk. This is quite useful to shield a Pokemon trying to set up, and can also be used on defensive Pokemon that wish to augment their bulkâ€”especially those with good Defense but poor Special Defense. Light Clay is a useful hold item that extends the duration of Light Screen to 8 turns, and rarely will the strategy of dual screens be used without it.</p>
