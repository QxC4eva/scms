<p>This is my first warstory so this is probably gonna suck ass. But I'll show you my team xP. If you saw me me there I was wearing a white The Cab shirt with rockets on it. A black and purple CR (Colorado Rockies) hat, Olimar and Pikmin white vans slipons. Also carried around my purple skateboard.</p>

<p>So I come here with Eric Wu (guy on left who went to world's and shit for TCG last few years and going this year) and don't know what to expect. I've never been to any video game tournament in my life. I'm confident as fuck from the training and effort I put in the last few weeks, putting Pokémon over school). But when my first round match started I was scared shitless of going home for nothing. However, my team scrapes the first guy and I'm like, alright, I can do this. Second round, still easy as fuck and he's going home. I think it was the 3rd round when I played Danukes AKA OnyxTiger. I didn't even know it was this kid til after the whole tourny. But anyway, this guy was the one who taught me everything. I learned the doubles metagame from him and he gave me a shitload of training. He put up a good fight but in the end, I made it to the 4th round. This next guy was easier then Danukes but still was a good match. My Palkia outsped his Special Rending, mymax Timid Speed against his Modest xP. Then later his Kyogre paralyzed mine, but then his Kingdra's Draco Meteor missed. But next turn my Top Mach Punched it, leaving him at 1 HP, and gave him another break. My Top was MVP as it got me to the Finalist's Lounge next turn. My friend Eric did fuckin beast too. He knew nothing til Friday night where I gave him a team and taught him everything. He got to Finals too with the Mewtwo/Abomasnow leads double Blizzarding everything. He told me his Scarfed Kyogre saved him a few times though. About 2:30 then and we gotta be back by 4:15 for finals.</p>

<p>I thought this was pretty funny, that when we went to Quizno's for some food, I went to have a sip of my drink and was like this is hella fucking shitty. I finished anyway and went to go back to get a refill and turns out it was fucking Pepsi. WTF man. Coke is one millions times better.</p>

<p>So Eric and I are running back almost late cause it's like 4:12 and they were calling us in the loudspeaker or whatever. Turns out there 29 people instead of 32, so 3 must have gotten booten out by hacked Pokés or something, idk. Three people get a bye including Eric getting a free spot in Top 16 (even though he's going to Nats for card game). So I'm scared shitless I ain't gonna make it to top 16. I face some random kid first round in finals (well, maybe he wasn't random; I just don't know my Smongonites). And my battle was on one of the TV screens. I had like two fans in the audience which was cool xD. Anyway I knock the shit out of this guy. 4-0 too, as my leads, Palkia and Toxicroak, were basically untouched. This fool tried to Stone Edge and it missed twice (idk why the fuck you would use that move anyway) But it wouldnt have changed the battle since I still had my Kyogre and my Top. I'm the first one to make in it Top 16. I'm so proud of myself for getting so far. My next match also got up on the screen, which was pretty fucking cool. I get some white guy idk who the fuck was but battled fucking beastly. First turn I get a Blizzard crit my Croak and I gave it up from there. I looked down at my shirt and you could see it moving hella fast from my heartbeat pumping like a motherfucker. I send out my Hitmontop next. The turn I Protect with Palkia in, he switches in Metagross and also switched in Giratina I think, so my Sucker Punch fails. Next turn I know what's coming and I had no idea what the fuck to do. Gross is going to Explode and I can't Protect again and my Top doesn't even have Protect. I didn't want my Kyogre on the bench to die either so I go after Giratina. Palkia kills that, Top does barely anything to Gross with Mach Punch. And here comes Explosion. Bye bye Palkia and Top. I'm left with Kyogre. And he still has 3 Pokémon. Game over for me. He's got Abomasnow, Weavile, and hail out. And I have a slow Kyogre with a Wacan Berry. Watch!: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f7oF5X_83g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f7oF5X_83g</a>. Anyways, I made top 16, got to meet Danukes and Deagle, the motherfuckers I trained with :D. And I met magickzzl; she was pretty cool. I probably saw some other Smogonites I didn't recognize. Oh, and Marriland himself was there.</p>
