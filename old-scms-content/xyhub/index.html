            <h3>Endless Battle Clause</h3>
                <h4>Posted by Jukain on <strong>December 18, 2013</strong></h4>
                    <p>As per the decision of the Smogon tiering leaders, a new clause call the <strong>Endless Battle Clause</strong> will be put into effect in all official Smogon tiers, as noted <a href="/forums/threads/endless-battle-clause.3495355/">here</a>. The goal of the clause is to ensure that strategies able to create an endless game&mdash;one that only ends when the opponent's Pok&eacute;mon have all been PP stalled or he or she forfeits. Currently, this clause only encompasses the use of Leppa Berry, Recycle, Heal Pulse, Block/Mean Look/Spider Web, and a healing move (such as Recover or Softboiled) in the same moveset. This is how it works (writing provided by Hugendugen):
                    <blockquote>Fortunately only Slowpoke, Slowbro, Slowking, Blissey and Smeargle are legally able to use this combination (Ralts, Kirlia, Gardevoir and Gallade as well if you count Wish). To use the strategy, one of these will switch into a defensive Pokemon, or one unable to 2hko them, use Block and then PP stall the opponent with recovery and Leppa Berry + Recycle. Once the opponent begins to Struggle, the user can simply continue to Heal Pulse, with Leppa Berry + Recycle, until the opponent forfeits.</blockquote>
                    <p>This clause for now specifically blocks this strategy, but any strategies determined to have the ability to cause an indefinite battle will be banned under this clause in the future. If you find any such strategies, please report them to a tiering leader! If you don't feel comfortable doing that, contact a <a href="/mentorship/profiles/">Smogon Mentor</a> and he or she will definitely address your concern.</p>

            <h3>Gengarite is being Considered for a Quickban</h3>
                <h4>Posted by Jukain on <strong>November 21, 2013</strong></h4>
                    <p>Gengarite, which enables Gengar to transform into Mega Gengar, is currently up for discussion on the forums as a reference point for the OU Council to decide whether it will be given a quickban. Like in the cases of Blaziken and Deoxys-N, the Council, which consists of Aldaron, Haunter, M Dragon, McMeghan, and Nachos, would vote on whether or not to ban Gengarite. A simple majority (3/5) would secure a stress-free, simple ban. The Council has opened a discussion <a href="/forums/threads/gengarite-tiering-discussion-now-with-poll.3493175/">here</a> where you can get your voice heard. If you would like to help sway the view of the Council in this controversial vote, then post!</p>
                    <p>Gengarite is under quickban consideration primarily because of its ability, Shadow Tag, which traps the opposing Pok&eacute;mon in. This can have highly disurptive effects, allowing teammates troubled by certain walls to sweep due to their removal. The topic of debate is primarily whether this disruption is so significant that it is unhealthy for OU. Points of contention include the scope of its trapping abilities and limitations, which are the deciding factors in whether it should be quickbanned or not. Calls to wait for suspect testing proper have also been made. If you want to view high-quality discussion with points from both sides, check out <a href="/forums/threads/gengarite-tiering-discussion.3493146/">this discussion</a> in the Policy Review forum. In here, discussion is limited to badgeholders and select other members, so you can get the best possible perspective on the debate. In any case, no matter your views, share them and perhaps bring a few others over to your side!</p>

            <h3>Blaziken and Deoxys-N Quick-Banned from XY and Pok√©Bank OU.</h3>
                <h4>Posted by Jukain on <strong>November 13, 2013</strong></h4>
                    <p>The OU council has concluded that Blaziken and Deoxys-N, two Pok√©mon allowed initially in XY, will be quick-banned from both current XY OU and Pok√©Bank OU. This means that there will be no public vote; the council has simply decided that this is necessary. Both have been preeminent threats since XY's inception, and are detrimental to the balance of the tier. Blaziken is simply a monster sweeper. Its power is unparalleled, being virtually impossible to counter or even check if the player lacks a Talonflame or Azumarill on his or her offensive team. Defensive teams can opt for Slowbro, defensive Gyrados, or in Pok√©Bank Jellicent, but these Pokemon just are not cut out for any other team in this metagame. With the addition of Baton Pass to its movepool and thus the ability to passed the boost it gains from Swords Dance and Speed Boost, it can pass to a teammate that could handle it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Deoxys-N is also way too powerful for OU to handle. Its dual 150 offenses in addition to Speed give it plenty of power to work with, and a devastating STAB Psycho Boost as well as a list of coverage moves that goes on for days make it virtually impossible to handle with any Pokemon&mdash;conventional or not. Deoxys-N was so obviously broken that there were some people who did not even realize it had been excluded from the initial banlist in the first place. It was not a Pokemon OU could adequately deal with in any way. Therefore, it was banned.</p>
                    
                    <p>Actual suspect tests will likely not begin until Pok√©Bank OU is released, so these will probably be the last bans until that time. Stay tuned for the latest XY!</p>
