<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/454.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Hippopotas</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 100 HP / 212 Def / 180 SpD<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Slack Off<br />
- Crunch</p>

<p>Of course, if i'm having a sandstorm team, the most important pokemon in the team would be Hippopotas. Why? Well, it's probably the only pokemon in the tier that can set up permanent sandstorm (fuck the move sandstorm).</p>

<p>The set is pretty standard and would'nt need much explanairy. What i usually do is set up rocks, stay in if my opp leads with something i can kill with EQ/Crunch, or switch out if i can't. People might be wandering why would i use Crunch over Roar, well, Crunch actually hits a few notable pokes hard. For example, it 3HKOs Slowpoke (With Sandstorm in effect), and OHKO Gastlys, while Gastly can't even come close to OHKO'ing it with Sludge Bomb/Shadow Ball or even the rare HP Ice (heh).</p>

<p><strong>Drilbur</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Sand Rush<br />
EVs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 212 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Rock Slide<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>OK, here comes my first sand abuser. Comatthew6 (yes, that nigga) introduced me to this set like two months ago, well like most people, i was curious of why would you use Eviolite on such an offensive poke, and i didn't know the use of protect either. But at that time i was like whatever, imma try it. So i laddered for a bit, and to my surprise, this set has scored me a lot of 5-0's and 6-0's on the ladder, including against some well known people.</p>

<p>Swords Dance is pretty much the only attack-boosting move available on Drillbur, so wynaut (Hone Claws Herp Derp). Earthquake and Rock Slide forms the infamous EdgeQuake combo (I'd call it SlideQuake here), while Protect is a good scouting move, while gives me the chance to evade moves like Fake Out. 36 Defense EVs might not seem much at a glance, but when paired with Eviolite, i can actually live a fuckin High Jump Kick from standard Mienshaos (Screw those random Life Orb Mienshaos).</p>

<p><strong>Lileep</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Storm Drain<br />
EVs: 68 HP / 220 Def / 220 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Energy Ball<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Stockpile<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>Sand Abuser Number 2. This thing is a pain in the ass to take down in Sandstorm (Tbh it's only if you're spamming special attacking moves at it). It's pretty much the Cradily of Little Cup, if you have tried taking down a SandStorm Cradily in NU, you'll probably know how annoying it is! </p>

<p>Stole this set from comatthew6's RMT(obviously) cuz it's better then other lileep sets i've used by far. Lileep is already annoying under Sandstorm with the Sp Def. boost, so after a Stockpile or two, it's literally impossible to take down barring crits. Energy Ball is Lileep's main stab, hitting stuff like Slowbro and Drillburs hard, while HP Fire surprises people who switches into a steel type trying to wall this set. (I don't think i need to explain why is Recover there or do i need to?)</p>

<p><strong>Slowpoke</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 116 HP / 236 Def / 36 SpA / 116 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Scald<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Slack Off</p>

<p>Sloooooooooooooooooowpokeeeee. This poke is my main physical wall, since physical moves still hurts unboosted Lileep pretty hard. It's the Slowbro of this tier, not only being sloooooooooooooooow but it's also a fuckin BEAST. </p>

<p>236 Defense EVs to take as much physical hits as possible, while with the Special Defense EVs, i can live a fuckin Dark Pulse from Houndoor at full health and KO it back with Scald (Ofcuz with eviolite). Fire Blast was in Psychic's spot to take down steels, but seeing that Timburr is still pretty annoying to the team, i decided to be mean and use Psychic over Fire Blast.</p>

<p><strong>Timburr</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Guts<br />
EVs: 156 HP / 36 Atk / 156 Def / 156 SpD<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Bulk Up<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Mach Punch<br />
- Payback</p>

<p>This thing rapes. Yes, it rapes. Timburr is one of the most broken shit of LC as there's only a few pokemon capable of taking hits from it well and or OHKO it (Uhm Acrobatics Driftloon?). I remember i first encountered this set is when i was tired of using Scraggy, and someone suggested this (Idr who was that). I quickly gave it a shot and not to my surprise, it rapes (Yeah i expected it to rape unlike that fuckin Drillbur).</p>

<p>Bulk Up is one of the most retarded set up moves in my dictionary (Orly) cuz it's pretty much Curse without the Speed Drop. Drain Punch and Payback gives Timburr nearly perfect coverage, while Mach Punch finishes off weakened pokemon that can hit Timburr hard otherwise (Fuckin Taillow).</p>

<p><strong>Gastly</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 36 Def / 196 SpA / 76 SpD / 200 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Hypnosis<br />
- Sludge Bomb<br />
- Shadow Ball</p>

<p>Sub-nosis Gastly, probably the best Gastly set (and yes, i stole this set from comatthew6's rmt again). Hypnosis fucks up stuff like munchlax who tries to switch in and trap me with dat big pursuit or Fuckin Stunky. Sludge Bomb and Shadow Ball are both reliable stabs, hitting stuff incredibility (how do i spell this again -_-) hard, barring faggots who brings in steel types vs me. </p>
