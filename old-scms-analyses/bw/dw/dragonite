[Overview]

<p>While Dragonite's presence in OU has often been harmed by faster, sleeker Dragon-types such Salamence, Dream World brought it one of the most game changing abilities: Multiscale. With Multiscale, Dragonite gained the ability to set up on nearly every threat in the metagame due to Multiscale halving damage from attacks when Dragonite is at full health. Additionally, Dragonite's large movepool and great offensive stats make it one of the scariest sweepers in the metagame. While Dragonite's Speed may seem underwhelming, its bulk and versatility compensates, and it is thus one of the most fearsome Pokemon in the Dream World metagame.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive Dragon Dance

move 2: Outrage

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The addition of Multiscale makes Dragonite's classic Dragon Dance set much more fearsome than before. Dragonite can essentially nab a free Dragon Dance even if the opponent sports an Ice-type move because the power of attacks is halved, and its bulk allows it to live through most moves. With just one boost, Dragonite can begin its rampage against the many frail Pokemon in DW OU, though with two boosts it will outspeed Pokemon that can cause problems, such as Choice Scarf Genesect. Outrage will do massive damage to any Pokemon that isn't a dedicated physical wall or a Steel-type. One should note that Outrage should not be spammed until all of these Pokemon are removed from the battle by other members of the team.</p>

<p>Fire Punch demolishes Ferrothorn, Scizor, Skarmory, and Genesect switching into a predicted Outrage. ExtremeSpeed is preferred in the last slot because it makes Dragonite a pseudo-revenge killer, but Earthquake can also be used because Dragonite would be walled by Heatran otherwise. When choosing between ExtremeSpeed and Earthquake, it is often best to see what your team needs more; Earthquake is a reliable answer to Heatran, while ExtremeSpeed is best used if you need a strong priority user.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread strengthens Dragonite's offensive potential by maximizing Attack and Speed for a quick sweep. With an Adamant nature, Dragonite's main checks—particularly Heatran—won't even be able to switch in without fearing a swift 2HKO if it has obtained at least two boosts. The item choice is based entirely upon preference. Those who wish to escape getting KOed quickly by errant Ice Beams or Ice Shards can opt for a Yache Berry, though this is not as useful as Leftovers or even Lum Berry. Since one of the most common ways of dealing with Dragonite is through status, Lum Berry will often be of good use; however, Leftovers offers reliable recovery and can often help out when sweeping. One should keep in mind that Lum Berry also has the ability to remove confusion after Outrage has confused Dragonite.</p>

<p>While Heatran will be troublesome without Earthquake, Dragonite is often able to plow through it given enough Dragon Dance boosts. However, this is not always the best alternative, so if one chooses to forgo Earthquake for a priority move in ExtremeSpeed, packing a means of defeating Heatran will be wise: Water-, Ground-, or Fighting-type moves should suffice. Additionally, Dragonite loves the presence of status absorbers such as Gliscor or Starmie, so their support is often appreciated. On another note, Rapid Spin support is important if one wants to be able to sweep at any given point in a match, as it preserves Multiscale and ensures that Dragonite will not be revenge killed easily. Again, Starmie works well here, as it packs Rapid Spin. Sun support works very well because it gives Fire Punch an additional buff. One should always pack a Pokemon that can adequately deal with Skarmory because without insurance against Skarmory, Dragonite can lose the boosts that it worked hard to gain by Skarmory's Whirlwind.</p>

<p>While Waterfall can be used on rain teams, it lacks the coverage presented by Fire Punch, and Dragonite would be forced to run Earthquake to prevent being walled by Ferrothorn. Brick Break is another move that works well on this set, as it provides perfect coverage with Outrage. However, it's a weak move, so you are generally better off running Earthquake, ExtremeSpeed, or Fire Punch in its place. Another option for the set is Fire Blast, which can be used instead of Fire Punch to potentially 2HKO Skarmory without any boosts. However, Dragonite prefers not to use a nature that lowers its great defenses, and with an Adamant or Jolly nature, it does not appreciate the cut in Special Attack either. In the rain, one can choose to use Aqua Jet instead of ExtremeSpeed as a priority move because it removes fast Choice Scarf users such as Landorus and Chandelure.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: ExtremeSpeed
move 4: Fire Punch / Waterfall / Dragon Claw
item: Choice Band
ability: Multiscale
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dragonite's high base Attack and decent base Speed allow it to successfully pull off a Choice Band set. While many key threats in the Dream World do outspeed Dragonite, it can make up for this with its massive power and access to priority moves. Outrage is Dragonite's main STAB attack, and does a giant chunk of damage to Pokemon that do not resist it; it even has the chance to 2HKO Heatran after Stealth Rock damage. Another asset available to Dragonite is Earthquake, which hits the aforementioned Heatran for super effective damage. However, Earthquake must be used with caution, as Dragonite will not be able to switch moves and might get set up on by Pokemon such as Latios. ExtremeSpeed is one of Dragonite's more reliable moves, as it makes Dragonite a potent revenge killer that can take out weakened faster foes such as Gyarados and Thundurus. The choice of move for the fourth moveslot really depends on the necessities of your team; Fire Punch is a reliable move to take down defensive behemoths such as Ferrothorn, also landing an OHKO on Genesect. However, one must keep in mind that most Genesect run Ice Beam, meaning they can get past Dragonite easily if Multiscale is broken. Waterfall is also a decent option, and it is also powered up by the ubiquitous rain . However, if one fears that getting locked into Outrage is unfavorable, Dragon Claw can be used as a reliable, albeit less powerful STAB.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are standard for a Choice Band user; maximum Attack and Speed for maximum power is a good motto to follow. With an Adamant nature, Dragonite has over 600 Attack with a Choice Band. While Dragonite is by no means fast, it outspeeds what it needs to, such as Breloom, Heatran, and Tyranitar, and it can tank most hits and KO Pokemon back with the appropriate move. though Dragonite does not have to necessarily invest fully in Speed to do so. However, there is usually no better place to put the EVs, and investing in Speed allows Dragonite to Speed tie with opposing Adamant Dragonite and Gyarados.</p>

<p>One thing that every user should note is to ensure that Chandelure is not on the opposing team before using ExtremeSpeed. If one uses ExtremeSpeed and the opponent brings out Chandelure, Dragonite will be a sitting duck for it to take it out or set up with Substitute and Calm Mind until ExtremeSpeed's PP expires. Another problem with the set is that every time Dragonite switches in, it will lose 25% of its health if Stealth Rock is up, so Rapid Spin support is obviously very helpful. Choice Band Dragonite also heavily appreciates Wish support because it has no reliable way of healing itself; Blissey, Chansey, and Jirachi thus make great partners for this set.</p>

<p>While there are other noteworthy options available to Dragonite such as Superpower, these can possibly limit Dragonite to using its inferior ability, Inner Focus. This is often unfavorable, and the given moves provide Dragonite with all the necessary coverage. Another option is Brick Break, and while it is inferior to Superpower in every aspect other than the drops in Attack and Defense, it can be used alongside Multiscale, making it viable. However, Earthquake is generally a better move because it provides Dragonite with similar coverage.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulky Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Dragon Claw / Outrage
move 3: Fire Punch / Earthquake
move 4: Roost
item: Leftovers / Lum Berry
ability: Multiscale
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 44 Atk / 212 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While the conventional offensive Dragon Dance set relies on using Multiscale to obtain a Dragon Dance boost, this set utilizes Dragonite's great bulk to sponge hits with ease and attempt a sweep. On average, bulky Dragonite is able to nab more Dragon Dance boosts than the offensive variant, though it won't be able to sweep as quickly. Since this set focuses more on consistency and bulk, Dragon Claw is the preferred option for Dragonite's primary STAB move; it allows Dragonite to use another move instead of getting locked into one, and preventing it from healing. However, one can use Outrage if the power drop is too large to handle. Fire Punch and Earthquake both provide Dragonite with great coverage, though choosing between the two can be difficult. With Fire Punch, Heatran completely walls Dragonite, but with Earthquake, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Bronzong all have their way with it. Roost is key to this set's success because it provides reliable recovery, as well as a neutrality to Ice-type moves and a chance to regain Multiscale.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs give Dragonite a decent amount of Attack to boost from while also allowing it to outspeed Starmie after just one Dragon Dance. Maximum HP EVs are invested because this Dragonite does not mind taking hits; in fact, it sets up thanks to its ability to sponge hits with its bulk. A spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used, but it usually leaves Dragonite too weak to do any major damage until it gets 3 or 4 boosts. Dragonite's item choice depends upon the team's needs; if the team packs a cleric such as Chansey or a status absorber such as Starmie, one can run Leftovers without a second thought. However, a Lum Berry is also a good option because one of the most common and popular ways of dealing with Dragonite is through status. Using a Lum Berry can also give Dragonite an extra turn of setup, which can be deadly in the long run.</p>

<p>While Dragonite can use Waterfall or Brick Break to take down Terrakion, Heatran, and Tyranitar, the two moves are fairly weak, and with only 44 Attack EVs, they will not be able to provide the good attacking power that one would hope for, even though Dragon / Fighting coverage is unresisted.</p>

<p>Partners for this set include those that can use Rapid Spin to ease Dragonite's setup. Starmie is remarkable in this regard because it can take down troublesome Skarmory and clear the field of entry hazards. Wish support is appreciated, but this Dragonite set is more independent than the offensive one due to the ability to heal itself. Thus, one does not need to worry about Dragonite's recovery. A cleric is always appreciated, however; Pokemon that can use Aromatherapy or Heal Bell will ease Dragonite's sweep immensely, and can often provide it with a second chance for sweeping.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute + Dragon Dance
move 1: Substitute

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While most Dragonite sets focus purely on the offensive characteristics of Dragonite, a Substitute + Dragon Dance set abuses its great 91 / 95 / 100 defenses of Dragonite and the utility of Multiscale to set up and quickly take down the opposition. Behind a Substitute, Dragonite can avoid all forms of status and also gain a way of avoiding getting revenge killed. Roost reliably recovers Dragonite's HP and even eliminates its Flying typing for one turn, which means that most Ice-type attacks will struggle to even do decent damage. On top of all of this, Roost gives Dragonite a chance to reactivate Multiscale, which can make opponents wrench their hair out in frustration among other things. Multiscale even activates when Dragonite is behind a Substitute, so it will be able to tank even super effective hits and keep its Substitute. Dragon Dance boosts Dragonite's Attack and Speed, so its offensive prowess is still one of the most threatening in the metagame. While Dragon Claw may seem like a weak move, at +6, the difference in Base Power does not matter much as it will still rip through most Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are useful for Dragonite because they allow it to outspeed Jolteon after one Dragon Dance and Choice Scarf Landorus after two. With 80 EVs invested in Special Defense, Dragonite will be able to stall out Choice Specs Politoed's Ice Beam solely with Substitute and Roost, thus allowing it to overcome even Ice-type moves that would normally hinder a sweep. While Dragonite can run either Earthquake or Fire Punch instead of Roost to deal with Steel-type Pokemon, nothing in the game enjoys taking +6 Dragon Claws, and the general utility of Roost should dissuade one from attempting to use extra coverage.</p>

<p>While Rapid Spin support is unnecessary due to Roost, one can opt for using Starmie to provide Rapid Spin and a means of breaking down durable physical walls such as Skarmory. In addition, Starmie is a great revenge killer and an adequate check to problematic Pokemon such as Choice Band Terrakion. However, Dragonite can often deal with most threats if at +1 because of its Speed and ability to Roost off damage and use Substitute. Also, Dragonite can stall out Stone Edge because of its meager 8 PP and low accuracy, so preparing for some of Dragonite's usual checks is often unnecessary. Toxic Spikes support allows Dragonite to stall out most walls that are not immune to Toxic while allowing Dragonite an easier time setting up. Ferrothorn does a good job walling this set, especially if it has Gyro Ball, so Chandelure can often provide good team support as well as a way to break down most walls. While this set is less reliant upon one's team than any other Dragonite set, it still needs a way to deal with Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Heatran effectively. Skarmory won't take much damage even from +6 Dragon Claw due to the lack of Attack investment. Also, Skarmory's access to Whirlwind makes Dragonite lose the time spent setting up, so Chandelure is also a good partner for this reason. Perish Song users such as Politoed and Celebi should be removed promptly before Dragonite proceeds to set up, and Unaware Quagsire and Ice Punch Metagross laugh at this set too. One should prepare adequately for Heatran and Hippowdon because both can sponge hits and use Roar to phaze Dragonite away, effectively decreasing the effectiveness of this set. This set works well in the rain because rain removes sandstorm, which in turn would cancel out Dragonite's Leftovers recovery. Without Leftovers recovery, attaining Multiscale becomes harder, and this set loses some of its main purpose: using healing and bulk to set up and sweep.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Dragonite most often runs Dragon Dance or Choice Band sets, it works very well as a rain abuser too. With rain support, Dragonite can effectively lure out its counters and wreak havoc with its amazing movepool. Hurricane's accuracy is perfect under rain, and with STAB and a large Base Power, it can destroy unprepared teams. It also KOes Breloom and Virizion handily, putting a stop to any sweep that was planned. Both Surf and Aqua Tail work very well under rain, as their Base Powers are effectively raised to 135; they also do heavy damage to Tyranitar and Heatran that try to switch in and wall Dragonite. ExtremeSpeed makes Dragonite a pseudo revenge killer that can check frailer threats that have lost HP due to prior damage. However, both Thunder and Draco Meteor are options for their damage output. Thunder also dissuades Skarmory from switching in on Dragonite, while Draco Meteor does heavy damage to any physical walls. The last move depends on the type of team Dragonite is on. Roost provides the ability to regain health, which works well for defensive players. It also mitigates the Life Orb damage that Dragonite takes. However, for those who worry about Chansey and Blissey walling this set, Superpower is another viable option.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>One must keep in mind the illegalities associated with Multiscale: with Superpower, Dragonite is forced to use Inner Focus, an inferior ability compared to Multiscale in all ways. However, that is not always a problem, as Superpower is also helpful for coverage purposes. Draco Meteor can be used for extra initial power, despite the drop in Special Attack. While running a Life Orb on a set with Multiscale may seem counterintuitive, it's actually very useful to nab extra KOs. Furthermore, Dragonite can simply Roost away any damage if worse comes to worst. Despite this, Dragonite also has the ability to run Leftovers on the set, but the drop in power is quite noticeable. If running a physical move such as Aqua Tail or ExtremeSpeed, Dragonite can also run an offensive EV spread of 252 Atk / 252 SpA / 4 Spe at the cost of some bulk.</p>

<p>Most people expect Dragonite to be the common Dragon Dance or Choice Band set, but with moves such as Hurricane and Aqua Tail, Dragonite will not be able to feign a Dragon Dance set for very long. While counters to this set include Pokemon that can take rain-boosted Aqua Tail and STAB Hurricanes, because the set is mixed and powered by a Life Orb, even dedicated walls will fall. However, Chansey and Blissey present a tough challenge unless Dragonite carries Superpower, so one should prepare accordingly. Terrakion works very well as a teammate to beat down the pink blobs, as does Breloom, as they appreciate the opportunity to switch in safely and set up.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Dragonite is undeniably one of the most diverse Pokemon in the game, with only Pokemon like Mew giving competition. Not only does it have a large attacking movepool, but it can utilize support options such as Thunder Wave, Tailwind, Heal Bell, and Haze to support teams. However, one must always take into account the illegalities associated with each supporting move, as Heal Bell and Multiscale are not compatible. Another option is Agility, though it is fairly redundant with Dragon Dance boosting both Attack and Speed already. Dragonite also has access to Dragon Tail, allowing it to phaze Espeon and thus break Baton Pass chains, and it can be used on more defensive sets.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Dragonite's sheer versatility makes it impossible for one set of concrete checks and counters, so the easiest way to be prepared for all threats is by utilizing a revenge killer that can take down Dragonite. Choice Scarf Terrakion, Genesect, Landorus, Latios, and Rotom-W can all come in and threaten an OHKO after Stealth Rock has broken Multiscale, while Timid Choice Scarf Chandelure can Speed tie with +1 Dragonite. However, one must note that these checks will fail should Multiscale be active. In addition, should Dragonite be at +2, it will outspeed the said checks and KO them with the appropriate move, so limiting Dragonite's opportunities to set up is heavily advised.</p>

<p>Physical sets such as Dragon Dance and Choice Band have more defined counters than the others; walls such as Skarmory and Slowbro can take a hit or two and retaliate back by either phazing or straight up KOing Dragonite. Should Dragonite be locked into Outrage, any bulky Steel-type will be able to come in and hurt Dragonite; Heatran, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn can all deal heavy damage to Dragonite or set up entry hazards. However, Dragonite can pack the appropriate move to KO all of these Pokemon, so one must be wary when switching in a Steel-type, as losing a solid counter to Dragonite early on in a match is certainly inadvisable. Other solid defensive presences that do well against Dragonite are Cloyster and Porygon2; both can sponge a hit and KO back with an Ice-type attack. Cloyster can also break through Multiscale due to Icicle Spear hitting multiple times. To add insult to injury, Porygon2 will even Trace Dragonite's ability, Multiscale, making it even harder to take down. Mew and Tangrowth are other solid counters, though Tangrowth can get 2HKOed by a +1 Fire Punch. Other noteworthy Pokemon that can be problematic are Choice Scarf Haxorus and Salamence; Haxorus can simply OHKO Dragonite through Multiscale with Outrage thanks to Mold Breaker, while Salamence is safe as long as Multiscale is broken. However, these two Pokemon have trouble surviving boosted ExtremeSpeed, so it is advised to carry another check or counter to Dragonite.</p>

<p>Possibly the most reliable way of taking down Dragonite is Stealth Rock support. With Stealth Rock, Multiscale will always be broken when Dragonite switches in, making it easier to take down. Residual damage from sandstorm is also very helpful in taking down Dragonite, as it cancels out Leftovers recovery that can be vital. This makes Dragonite prone to revenge killing, unless of course it carries ExtremeSpeed. Finally, status, particularly burn and paralysis, will cripple Dragonite for the rest of the match unless it packs a Lum Berry.</p>
