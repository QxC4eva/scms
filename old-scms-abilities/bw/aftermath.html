<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the wielder is KOed by a contact attack, the attacker takes damage equal to 25% of its maximum HP. Aftermath will not work if there is a Pokemon with <a href="/bw/abilities/damp">Damp</a> on the field.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2> 
<p>This ability appears very situational, but in the right circumstances it can be very useful to hurt physical attackers, especially when <a href="/bw/items/life_orb">Life Orb</a> is also depleting their health. While there are many better abilities, the Pokemon that have Aftermath usually have few usable alternatives. The fully evolved Pokemon that have Aftermath are <a href="/bw/pokemon/skuntank">Skuntank</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/drifblim">Drifblim</a> (although if playing with Dream World Pokemon, <a href="/bw/pokemon/garbodor">Garbodor</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/electrode">Electrode</a> also gain the ability). Aftermath is one of the factors that make Skuntank in particular a dangerous opponent, so it should under no circumstances be underestimated. The pre-evolutions of the aforementioned Pokemon can also use this ability effectively in Little Cup.</p>
