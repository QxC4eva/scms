Overview
########

    Heatran is one of the best checks to top threats such as Talonflame, Genesect, and Aegislash.
    It's also one of the best switch ins to the ever popular Fairy types.
    Heatran has incredible defensive typing.
    It has both defensive and offensive potential.
    It's base 77 speed isn't that great.
    It's typing leaves it weak to common Fighting, Ground, and Water type attacks.



Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Lava Plume
move 2: Protect
move 3: Roar / Earth Power
move 4: Toxic / Will-O-Wisp / Stealth Rock
ability: Flash Fire
item: Leftovers
nature: Calm
evs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD

Moves
========

    Lava Plume is solid consistent STAB with 30% chance of burn
    Protect gains crucial Leftovers recovery and scouts the opponent's moves and works great in conjunction with Toxic.
    Roar allows Heatran to act as a phazer for dangerous threats, such as RP Genesect, SD Talonflame, and QD Volc.
    Earth Power is an option to nail other Heatran.
    Toxic nails bulky Water types on the switch like Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W.
    Will-O-Wisp can be used to allow Heatran to deal with Mega Mawlie a lot easier, and softens physical blows aimed at Heatran.
    Stealth Rock can be used on Heatran if you can't find room anywhere else on your team.


Set Details
========

    248 EVs are used for HP number (SR). Rest are placed into SpDef and Def
    Lava Plume is preferred STAB of choice, for it's 30% burn rate.
    Stealth Rock should only be an option if you can't find room anywhere else.
    Taunt is a viable option to stop Talonflame and Volcarona setting up in front of you, as well as stopping Chansey and Blissey nicely.


Usage Tips
========

    This set is generally aimed at defensive and balanced teams.
    Heatran can easily tank weak Water type attacks from Jellicent and other bulky Water types, so even if you can't predict their switch in, it might be best to Toxic them regardless (as with the combination of Protect and Roar, you easily gain back health via Leftovers).
    Be careful when using Protect, as it can often be used as set up fodder for sweepers like Garchomp and Terrakion.
    Heatran can phaze Dragon Dance users, but it shouldn't be your main check, as it still does take quite a lot from boosted Outrages and it's often hit for SE damage by Dragon types coverage moves


Team Options
========

    Bulky Grass types are incredible partners for Heatran. Celebi, Gouregiest, Amoonguss, and Trevenent are all options.
    Bulky Water types are also good. Rotom-W, Quagsire, Gastrodon
    Having a solid physical wall to take on Garchomp and Terrakion is generally a good option. This makes Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon all good team mates.
    Clefable is a great partner for Heatran, as it can easily take on Fighting type attacks aimed at Heatran, while also providing Wish support, while Heatran easily takes on Steel types that annoy Clefable.



Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Stealth Rock / Hidden Power [Ice]
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Toxic
ability: Flash Fire
item: Air Balloon / Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Stealth Rock inflicts damage every turn and helps wear down your opponent.
    Fire Blast is STAB and hits very hard.
    Earth Power offers coverage and has solid base power.
    Heatran is a great user of Stealth Rock, just because it can force many switches.
    HP Ice is an option if you're already using a Stealth Rock user on your team.
    The last move slot depends on what you'd rather cover. Will-O-Wisp is for dangerous physical attackers like Mawlie and Azumarill, while Toxic is mostly for Fire types like Volcarona and Talonflame that are immune to Will-O-Wisp. Toxic also hits bulky Water types that love to switch into Heatran.



Set Details
========

    EVs are used for max power and speed.
    With Air Balloon in tact, this set acts as a great check to Excadrill, Garchomp, and other Ground types.
    Due to it's one time use, Leftovers can be considered over Air Balloon.
    Ancient Power is an option for it's ability to easily beat Volcarona and Talonflame without having to rely on status.



Usage Tips
========

    This set is generally aimed at more balanced or offensive teams.
    Try and keep Air Balloon in tact for as long as possible, as it can act as a check to very key Pokemon.
    This set doesn't require too much prediction, as Fire Blast is a very spamable STAB attack.
    This set has no hope in getting past special walls like Blissey and Gastrodon, so it's probably best to severally weaken them before firing off Fire Blasts.



Team Options
========

    Rotom-W is probably the best partner to this set, for it's ability to force switches (racking up SR damage), and it's ability to beat Water types / amazing synergy.
    Celebi and other bulky Grass types work nicely with this set for their amazing synergy together.
    Having a partner that can deal with sturdy special walls is a good idea, so powerful physical sweepers like Garchomp and Scizor make for good partners.

Usage Tips
========

    For the Choice Specs set, you're generally going to want to just spam Fire Bast most of the time.


Team Options
========

    Because of Specs Heatran's ability to wall break, sweepers that can clean up late game are good team mates. This includes Thundurus, Landorus, Lucario, and Keldeo.
    Of course it can fit onto more balanced team as well, so again Rotom-W, and other bulky Water types also make for good partners. (And Grass types).


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Flash Cannon
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Flamethrower / Hidden Power Ice
ability: Flash Fire
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

    Flash Cannon is STAB and has solid base power.
    Earth Power offers nice general coverage and allows Heatran to nail opposing Fire types like Heatran and Infernape.
    Flamethower is an option on the Scarf set for a weaker, yet more reliable STAB option.
    Hidden Power Ice is an option for more coverage.



Set Details
========

    EVs are used for max power and speed. Timid is the main nature of choice for the Scarf set for it's ability to revenge kill Adamant Lucario and Adamant Dragonite.
    The Scarf set is more suited to revenge killing.
    Ancient Power is an option for it's ability to easily beat Volcarona and Talonflame.



Usage Tips
========

    The Scarf set is aimed more towards balanced teams.
    The Choice Scarf set isn't nearly as effective as it used to be, as the metagame just gets faster and faster, so keep this in mind when using Choice Scarf Heatran.


Team Options
========

    Rotom-W, and other bulky Water types make for good partners.
    Grass types too.
    The Scarf set is more suited to balanced teams and is more of a glue to a team that needs to revenge kill certain threats.


Trapper
########
name: Trapper
move 1: Magma Storm
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Protect
move 4: Taunt
ability: Flash Fire
item: Leftovers
nature: Calm
evs: 248 HP / 8 Spe / 252 SpD

Moves
========

    Magma Storm hits pretty hard with it's awesome base power and slower chips away at your opponent.
    Toxic nails bulky Water types on the switch like Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W.
    Protect gains crucial Leftovers recovery and scouts the opponent's moves and works great in conjunction with Toxic.
    Taunt shuts down a lo of Heatran's checks, like Blissey and Jellicent, allowing you to beat them one on one easily.


Set Details
========

    248 EVs are used for HP number (SR)
    Magma Storm has shaky accuracy, but the chip damage on common switch ins is worth it.
    Taunt really works nicely on this set, but do be cautious about Heatran getting too low on health by taking Scald's from Jellicent and Seismic Tosses from Blissey.


Usage Tips
========

    This set is generally aimed at teams that love special walls removed.
    Heatran can easily tank weak Water type attacks from Jellicent and other bulky Water types, so even if you can't predict their switch in, it might be best to Toxic them regardless.
    Heatran's only recovery is Leftovers, so be sure to abuse Protect as much as possibly and don't let Heatran get too low on health.


Team Options
========

    Special sweepers that have a hard time getting past Jellicent and Blissey work best with this set, meaning sweepers like Choice Scarf Keldeo and Landorus-I work really well with this set.
    Bulky Grass types are incredible partners for Heatran. Celebi, Gouregiest, Amoonguss, and Trevenent are all options.
    Bulky Water types are also good. Rotom-W, Quagsire, Gastrodon
    Having a solid physical wall to take on Garchomp and Terrakion is generally a good option. This makes Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon all good team mates.


Other Options
########

    Taunt is an option to cripple Blissey and Vaporeon on the switch.
    A Sunny Day set with Magma Storm is a possibility.



Checks & Counters
########

    Chansey and Blissey can take anything Heatran throws at it.
    Bulky Water types are great switch ins to most sets, but they must be wary of Toxic. Rotom--W, Jellicent, and Politoed are all common Water types. Starmie gets a special mention for it's ability to spin away SR and has Natural Cure.
    Rock types like Tyranitar and Terrakion can check Heatran nicely, but they must be wary of Flash Cannon.
    Fighting types like Keldeo and Conkeldurr can easily take a hit and force Heatran out.
    Dugtrio can revenge kill Heatran thanks to it's ability Arena Trap and Ground STAB.
