<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Depending on the user's IVs, the type and Base Power of the move can be altered. Type is calculated using the following formula:</p>

<code><var>Type</var> = (<var>A</var> + <var>B</var> + <var>C</var> + <var>D</var> + <var>E</var> + <var>F</var>) * 15 / 63</code>

<ul>
<li>If the IV of HP is odd, then A = 1.</li>
<li>If the IV of Attack is odd, then B = 2.</li>
<li>If the IV of Defense is odd, then C = 4.</li>
<li>If the IV of Speed is odd, then D = 8.</li>
<li>If the IV of Special Attack is odd, then E = 16.</li>
<li>If the IV of Special Defense is odd, then F = 32.</li>
<li>If the IV of any are even, then their variable = 0</li>
</ul>

<p>This number is rounded down, and then determined by the following table:</p>

<pre>
0 = Fighting
1 = Flying
2 = Poison
3 = Ground
4 = Rock
5 = Bug
6 = Ghost
7 = Steel
8 = Fire
9 = Water
10 = Grass
11 = Electric
12 = Psychic
13 = Ice
14 = Dragon
15 = Dark
</pre>

<p>Base Power is, likewise, determined thus:</p>

<code><var>Power</var> = (<var>U</var> + <var>V</var> + <var>W</var> + <var>X</var> + <var>Y</var> + <var>Z</var>) * (40 / 63) + 30 </code>

<ul>
<li>If the IV of HP divided by 4 has remainder 2 or 3, then U = 1.</li>
<li>If the IV of Attack divided by 4 has remainder 2 or 3, then V = 2.</li>
<li>If the IV of Defense divided by 4 has remainder 2 or 3, then W = 4.</li>
<li>If the IV of Speed divided by 4 has remainder 2 or 3, then X = 8.</li>
<li>If the IV of Special Attack divided by 4 has remainder 2 or 3, then Y = 16.</li>
<li>If the IV of Special Defense divided by 4 has remainder 2 or 3, then Z = 32.</li>
<li>If the IV of any divided by 4 has remainder 0 or 1, then their variable = 0</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, if the IV is 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 30, or 31, you use the number given, otherwise, use 0.</p>

<p>The final number is rounded down, and that is the power of your Hidden Power.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>As Hidden Power can be any type, (bar Normal) it is a fundamental move for special attackers, providing a decently powered coverage move of a type that the user may otherwise lack. Almost every Pokemon in the game has access to this move, and it's everywhere. Latios, for example, does not learn any Fire-type moves to cover the Steel-type Pokemon that wall its STAB, so uses Hidden Power Fire to patch up this problem. The potential for this move is nearly endless, and can be a nasty surprise for otherwise solid counters. Some general rules of thumb are: most Dragon-types will carry Hidden Power Fire, Water- and Fire-types will have Hidden Power Grass, Grass- and Electric-types will have Hidden Power Ice, and Ghost-types will have Hidden Power Fighting. Always expect the unexpected, and just remember that the presence of Hidden Power is largely a case-by-case basis.</p>
