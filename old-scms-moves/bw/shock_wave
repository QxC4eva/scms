<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Shock Wave is useless move competitively. Due to the Evasion Clause, you will almost never see a Pokemon who can avoid 100% accurate attacks like Thunderbolt, which is always superior to Shock Wave. Nearly every Pokemon with access to Shock Wave also has access to Thunderbolt.</p>
