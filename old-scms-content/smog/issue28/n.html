<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The last few years have changed the face of Unova. The citizens have survived brainwashing, freezing, and a desire to scream "when will this end?" One man stood for the Pok&eacute;mon and the virtues of truth and ideals when nobody else would; that man was N.</p>

<p>N grew up in a forest among Pok&eacute;mon. It was in the forest where he found an even greater appreciation for all living things&mdash;more specifically, Pok&eacute;mon. Zorua in particular befriended N, as not only did they have similar hair, they also went through similar experiences in life and thus had similar ideals: to protect those that mattered most to them. Unfortunately, the forest's harmony was destroyed when a scheming Ghetsis earned N's trust, claiming N would be the "king" of Unova. During N's years with Ghetsis, it was said that Ghetsis would bring him injured Pok&eacute;mon and tell him that humans caused their suffering. To N, Pok&eacute;mon represented not only his childhood, but his best friends, and he wanted to fight to give them freedom. Ghetsis's plan was working, soon N would be the face of Team Plasma, and Ghetsis would get one step closer to his ultimate goal.</p>

<p>I sat down with N earlier while he flipped through a picture book documenting his experiences.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>N glanced down at the picture book and let out a sigh as he realized how many years had passed since he first met Ghetsis and was taken from his paradise.</p></div>

<h2>What was life like in the forest?</h2>

<p>I befriended many different species. We have many friends in this world, but we don't always treat them as friends! I learnt to understand Pok&eacute;mon in the wild. I formed a bond with them. I could understand everything they said. They understood everything I said, too... Having respect for Pok&eacute;mon is important, because when you respect Pok&eacute;mon, they will respect you, too!</p>

<p>I met Zorua in the forest. She was also abandoned by her parents... left alone in the forest with nobody else. I had to be there for her, or she would have been alone. Nobody should be alone, especially not Pok&eacute;mon. They should be with their family, and free from oppression. She told me that after being abandoned, she eventually found a trainer whom she trusted completely. Sadly though, the trainer became corrupted; he was overcome by foolish human greed and the desire to win. He forced her to fight when she had very little energy left. The idea of that outraged me! I vowed to make her happy  and help her find happiness in the world.</p>

<p>I was the only human she trusted from then on... I wanted to show her that she could grow up to be a strong Zoroark.</p>

<h2>How did you meet Ghetsis?</h2>

<p>I was playing with Darumaka in the shrubs when I saw a green-haired man standing in the forest. His hair color was similar to mine, but that was all we had in common. He was cunning, I was naive. He asked if I could come with him, as he could sense something mysterious about me and said he had a connection to me. After not having had human contact for a while, I wasn't really trusting at first, but for some reason, when he told me he was my father, I believed him. I didn't know whether it was true, but how could I have known? I wanted a real family, and he promised he could give me the family I wanted, as well as keep all the friends I'd made. He never told me why he abandoned me in the forest in the first place, though... or if he was even my father; I only realized later that these promises were just a ruse to gain my trust.</p>

<p>After I started talking to him, I fell for everything: the idealistic world where both humans and Pok&eacute;mon live separate lives, and the truth that nothing was seemingly impossible. I wanted this world, and I vowed to fight for it.</p>

<h2>How did you become "king" of Team Plasma?</h2>

<p>Ghetsis came to my bedroom one day and showed me blueprints for a castle. I was smart for my age, but I was still a child at heart and the idea of my own castle... it just seemed so perfect. I could do so much in my own castle&mdash;it could be a place where all Pok&eacute;mon could roam free and be happy!</p>

<p>Ghetsis told me that to be king I had to become king of Team Plasma. He explained that Team Plasma believed in liberating Pok&eacute;mon from humans&mdash;it was the one thing I knew was right after everything I had seen! It had to happen, and I would fight for this ideal world. I fought too hard, sadly. That's my only regret. I wish I could have seen the truth at that time. But was the decision to lead Team Plasma really a bad thing? I don't think so. I believed in what I thought the cause was for, and I had to spread the message of liberation throughout Unova.</p>

<p>Ghetsis started showing me Pok&eacute;mon that were hurt by humans. The thought of hurt Pok&eacute;mon disgusted me... but instead of wanting to cry for them, it worked the opposite way for me. I was even more motivated to do as much as I could!</p>

<p>Just before Team Plasma was about to make their first public appearance, Ghetsis took me into a small room with Anthea and Concordia. He told me that it was time for my initiation as king. With the Sages present, I was handed a crown, and I wore it with pride. To me, it meant that I could now further help Team Plasma change the world for the better.</p>

<p>Ghetsis told me that as king, I had to remain undercover until it was time to reveal myself. If I appeared to be a normal trainer, people would trust me easier, and not hate me because I was a king. At the time it made so much sense, but I didn't see the truth Ghetsis was hiding...</p>

<h2>You go by N as your name rather than your full name (Natural Harmonia Gropius). Why?</h2>

<p>I think it's best for you to find your own reason behind my name. It can mean so many things. It can represent nature&mdash;the thing I care about the most&mdash;the north&mdash;which is where my castle lies&mdash;and finally nurture&mdash;anything can grow into something amazing if it's nurtured enough!</p>

<h2>Where do you plan to head now?</h2>

<p>I want to show the world there's more to life than selfish human desires... I want to show everyone that friendship with Pok&eacute;mon is important! I've spent so many years here, but now it's time to move on. I want my dreams of an equal world for Pok&eacute;mon and humans to come true. I want to teach everyone that Pok&eacute;mon are our friends, and not tools we fight with!</p>

<p>I still want Pok&eacute;mon to be free, but I realize that it's their choice to be with their trainers, and that all trainers aren't like Zorua's...</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<div class="aside"><p>N looked into the window to the left of me and noticed a dark shadow cast over the top of me.</p>

<p>"You don't have to hide anymore, Zorua... or should I say Zoroark?" he said to me.</p>

<p>"Thank you, for everything," I replied.</p>

<p>N flipped his picture book shut and dug into his almost-melted ice cream, while I walked away.</p></div>
