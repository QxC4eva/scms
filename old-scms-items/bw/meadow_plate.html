<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that increases the Base Power of all Grass-type moves by 20%. When held by a Pokemon with the Multitype ability, the holder's type will change to Grass.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Grass Arceus is a very solid supporting Pokemon. It brings a useful slew of resistances that allow it to combat dangerous threats such as Groudon, Garchomp, Terrakion, Zekrom, Rayquaza, and Kyogre, and in the rain it is even able to counter Palkia! However, it is hampered somewhat by its poor offensive STAB, at it is resisted by a lot of types and will be walled by something no matter what attacking combination it chooses.</p>

<p>However, it is generally useless aside from Arceus, as most other Grass-types find the power boost from Meadow Plate to be too menial.</p>

<h2>Location</h2> 
<p>Abyssal Ruins, 1F.</p>
