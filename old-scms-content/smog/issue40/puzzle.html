<blockquote><p>Hm? What's this? A little scrap of paper appears to have fallen out of your copy of The Smog! There are some pretty confusing sentences scribbled on this piece of paper. You do your best to make them out:</p>

<p>Exhausting again? (8)<br />
Ageless French cheese (4)<br />
Something not in the haze? (4)<br />
Fear about prices (4)<br />
Healthy source of water (4)</p>

<p>Huh! That was weird. You crumple up the scrap of paper and focus your attention on the rest of the page:</p></blockquote>

<p>Welcome to our special 40th issue edition of the Puzzle Page here at The Smog! As always, we're open to feedback; if there's some type of puzzle you'd like to see included in the next issue, or if you have a gripe with this issue's puzzles, feel free to send a VM to Level 51 or air your opinion in the feedback poll or release thread.</p>

<p>In honor of The Smog's 40th issue, we've added some extra goodies for those of you who have had a far too easy time steamrolling through our puzzles from previous issues, so you can look forward to an extra tier of parameter puzzles and a bonus mystery sound! Before that, however, it's time for another round of congratulations to our astute puzzlers who rose to the top last issue.</p>

<p>First off, congratulations to the three users who actually submitted entries for the parameter puzzles from last year! While most of you evidently had a pretty hard time, ethan06 once again came out on top, with a perfect score of 15 out of 15! Next in line were xfix and ILRB, with scores of 14 and 12, respectively. The other two users to win the prize of a custom title are The Ordinary and MadMunky20k, who demonstrated their aural abilities in a pretty tough edition of the mystery sounds. Finally, let's not forget PriestLee, who was the first to submit a completely correct crossword grid, earning themselves a custom avatar on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown!</p>

<h2>Parameter Puzzles</h2>

<p>Your challenge for these questions is to obtain the given list of Pok&eacute;mon from the "/dexsearch" command on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! using the correct number of parameters as shown! Note that "all" does not count as a parameter and that the exclusions mentioned are included in the total number of parameters. Can you figure out which parameters were used to obtain these results?</p>

<p>Simply type "/dexsearch" on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! for a quick introduction to the command. The first three users to send in all 15 correct answers will earn themselves a custom title on the Smogon forums, failing which the three users with the highest scores will earn these custom titles instead!</p>

<p>The fourth level of parameter puzzles is a recent addition, so I guess an explanation is in order. What these puzzles do is combine multiple dexsearch results into a single list, requiring you to reverse engineer the sets and the parameters used to define those sets. For example, suppose I had a puzzle that looked like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Aipom, Furret, Pachirisu, Pikachu, Raichu, Raticate, Rattata, Sentret, Smeargle (2 sets, totaling 4 parameters)</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually, I'd find that the answer would be a combination of {Follow Me, Nuzzle}, which gives Pachirisu, Pikachu, Raichu, and Smeargle, and {Run Away, U-turn}, which gives Aipom, Furret, Pachirisu, Raticate, Rattata, and Sentret. Note that even though Pachirisu appears in both sets of results, it is only shown once. Furthermore, the parameters don't have to be split evenly between the sets&mdash;you could see puzzles combining a set of 1 parameter and a set of 3 parameters! Good luck&mdash;you'll need it!</p>

<ol class="param-puzzle">
    <li>
    <strong>Level 1: Simple &ndash; the only parameters used here will be moves!</strong>

        <li>Absol, Drowzee, Hypno, Persian, Skuntank, Smeargle, Stunky (2 sets, totaling 4 parameters, 1 of which is an exclusion)</li>
        <li>Arcanine, Geodude, Golem, Granbull, Graveler, Growlithe, Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, Raticate, Rattata, Smeargle, Snubbull, Staraptor (3 sets, totaling 6 parameters)</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Mystery Sound</h2>
