[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Moves without a secondary effect have a 10% chance to flinch the target. This is considered a secondary effect by Shield Dust, meaning that the receiver will not flinch. Does not work with Serene Grace. Triggers once per hit for Triple Kick and Beat Up. For other multi-hit attacks, Kings Rock triggers once per hit, and again after all hits. This effect is cumulative with moves that already have a flinch chance.</p>
