<h3>What's New in RU</h3>
<p>Posted on <strong>Nov 24, 2012</strong></p>

<p>Just recently, RU Stage 11 just ended meaning that <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3475064">Stage 12</a> has just begun. The council decided that both Cresselia and Durant deserve places in RU, and they have been brought down as a result. Stage 12 will be a bit different however. The <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3475063">council</a> has been revamped, and the ladder will be run a bit differently this time around. During the first two weeks (until December 5th), the ladder will include both Cresselia and Nidoqueen. The following two weeks will test the ladder without these two Pokemon in order to find the most balanced metagame.</p>

<p>In other news, you might have noticed some new additions to the hub. First off, we have the Articles section which includes pieces exclusive to the RU hub which are very informative, so you should check them out. Second, we have the Resources section which includes go-to threads if you want to learn how to play the tier or if you want to participate in projects. Finally, we have the Records section which includes all of the winners of RU projects and events. <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3474606">RarelyUsed Contributions and Corrections</a> also has a ton of new things that need to be written, so check that out as well. RU is going to be very exciting in the next month, so be sure to stay up to date on all of the events. ~DittoCrow</p>

<p><a href="/forums/member.php?u=127181">Yonko7</a> is the third and final winner of the RU Awards! Yonko7 showed some great posts and creativity throughout the forum; he made a huge splash in the Rain Collaboration Challenge and won two Pokemon of the Week challenges, which led to him getting the Most Creative Poster Award to narrowly defeat Pocket, the previous RU Awards winner. Congrats Yonko7!</p>

<p>Now for some more good news and some bad news. The bad: the RU Awards will not be continued in further rounds of RU. It helped get the forum off to a solid start, but now its time is done. However, you will still be able to earn a seat on the rotating council by showing excellent posting skills, so don't give up! The good news is that the round is almost over, so there will be a couple of cool things in the future. We will soon find out if Durant and Cresselia will become RU, so be on the lookout for that. There are also many great, new threads to come, so be on the look out for those! This will all be posted here, so don't forget to check back! ~DittoCrow</p>
