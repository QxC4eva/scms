[SHORT DESC]
Averages both Pok√©mon's HP.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Both the user's and the target's HP values are set to (user's current HP + target's current HP) / 2. If a Pokemon's maximum HP is lower than this value, then that Pokemon's HP is set to its maximum value. Pain Split ignores all Accuracy and Evasion modifiers, but will fail if used against a Substitute. Pain Split is unaffected by type immunities.
