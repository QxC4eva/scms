<h2>Description</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/moves/selfdestruct">Selfdestruct</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/explosion">Explosion</a> will fail while the wielder is on the field. The user will not faint. It also prevents a Pokemon with <a href="/bw/abilities/aftermath">Aftermath</a> from dealing damage after it has fainted.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While last generation this ability had some merit, since Explosion and Selfdestruct had their power halved this generation, Damp is near enough useless, as almost no Pokemon ever run such moves anymore. It may have some situational use, but for the most part, it should be avoided if another choice is available.</p>
