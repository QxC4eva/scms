<p>Bloo has gone very far since he first joined Smogon on January 20, 2009. Starting as a promising Team Rater, Bloo has progressively gotten better at competitive battling, and he has deservingly received the title of the Head Tournament Director after years of hard work. Unfortunately, Bloo has been extremely busy as of late due to his dedication at grad school, so we could not collect any information out of him about his battling strategies and his battle against Eternal and Masterclass on Friday, October 4; however, rumor has it that Bloo is very scary to face in battle, so hopefully he shown that side of him in his matches, and congratulations to him on his win!</p>

<p>M Dragon is also another fellow Tournament Director, and he has been part of the Smogon community since 2008. M Dragon typically uses balance (semi-stall or bulky offense) teams, but he isn't limited to just that; he can play a variety of battle styles. In fact, in every round of the Smogon Tour on Saturday, October 5, M Dragon used nearly every playstyle! Anyways, this tournament in particular had a bit of difficulty starting of, but it managed to stay strong into the finals, where Boudouche and M Dragon faced off. M Dragon used a bulky offense team based around entry hazards with dangerous sweepers; his Empoleon lead with Stealth Rock against Boudouche's Empoleon, in which the former won the face off. Throughout the match, M Dragon was able to slowly whittle away at the opponent, and in the end, his Adamant Dragonite KOed Boudouche's Breloom and claimed the victory. Congrats to M Dragon, the winner of this tour!</p>

<p>Honor has been competitively playing for the past year, and he has been involved in tournaments ever since. His favorite playstyle are bulky offensive teams, but he is also very versatile in his battle styles. Honor has asked that his teams are not to be leaked due to privacy reasons, which we shall respect. That being said, on Sunday, October 6, Honor won against both Vinc2612 and MeowMixx in a 3-man final; however the match went down, I'm sure it was a splendid performance from our finalists. Congratulations to Honor on the victory!</p>
