<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Pressure deducts an additional PP from a move that targets the wielder, the wielder's side, or both sides (including <a href="/bw/moves/imprison">Imprison</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/snatch">Snatch</a>). If multiple Pokemon have Pressure, the effect stacks. Pressure will not take effect on allies' moves. Pressure also gives a message when the wielder switches in stating that it has Pressure. If the move's user changes, Pressure's effect only applies to the original user. Moves selected by <a href="/bw/moves/sleep_talk">Sleep Talk</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/assist">Assist</a>, or similar moves will not lose PP.</p> 

<p>When a Pokemon with this ability is first in the party, wild encounters have a higher chance of occurring.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Pressure is a pretty average ability but it has been known to have been useful in the past, on sets such as <a href="/bw/moves/rest">Rest</a> + Sleep Talk <a href="/bw/moves/calm_mind">Calm Mind</a> <a href="/bw/pokemon/suicune">Suicune</a> (Crocune) and SubRoost <a href="/bw/pokemon/zapdos">Zapdos</a>. Unfortunately those are still the best options in OU today, as most Pressure users reside in the Uber tier. <a href="/bw/pokemon/ho-oh">Ho-Oh</a> can pull off a good SubRoost set there too.</p>
