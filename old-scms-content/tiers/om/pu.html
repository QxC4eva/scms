<h2>What is PU?</h2>

<p>PU is a hypothetical tier underneath NU that features any Pok&eacute;mon with a usage cutoff of 3.406% or lower. This name does not mean Poorly Used, Partially Used, or Potentially Used; it is a play on words that references to "pee-you!", a noise something makes when another stinks. PU is quite the popular tier and has it's own room on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! that can be found <a href="pokemonshowdown.com/PU">here</a>, an IRC channel you can find <a href="http://cbe002.chat.mibbit.com/?channel=%23pu&server=irc.synirc.net">here</a>, or you can discuss it in the main thread <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/xy-pu-musharna-banned.3513882/">here</a>. There's a variety of different ways to find discussion on PU! The viability thread can be found <a href="/forums/threads/.3517353/">here</a>!</p>

<h4>Threat List</h4>

<img src="/tiers/om/costa.png" alt="" /> <strong>Carracosta:</strong> Carracosta is a very large threat thanks to its access to the incredibly potent move Shell Smash, instantly boosting its offenses and Speed to threatening levels. Furthermore, Carracosta has reliable bulk and a solid ability which allow it the luxury of an easy setup in most cases. Carracosta is also quite unpredictable in its coverage, having an expansive selection of moves from both the physical and special spectrum. Surprisingly, Carracosta can even pull of a fantastic defensive set with its high bulk! Carracosta is a top threat in PU that every team must account for.<br/>
<img src="/tiers/om/wrath.png" alt="" /> <strong>Poliwrath:</strong> Poliwrath is a large threat in the metagame thanks to its unique typing and immunity to Water-type moves. Poliwrath's high physical bulk allows it to wall a large portion of the metagame, including Carracosta and Sneasel. With the recent Musharna ban, Poliwrath has only increased in usefulness and usage! Poliwrath is a prime defensive Pok&eacute;mon and is extremely common.<br />
<img src="/tiers/om/sneasel.png" alt="" /> <strong>Sneasel:</strong> Thanks to Sneasel's high Speed , it is able to outspeed the vast majority of the unboosted metagame. This Speed backed with Sneasel's powerful Knock Off and high Attack is a perfect recipe for a threat. Sneasel also has access to a powerful priority move in Ice Shard and a great neutral coverage with its STABs alone. And, while its effectiveness has decreased slightly since the beginning of the tier, Sneasel is still a large threat that has to be accounted for when teambuilding.
