<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of +1.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Despite having priority, something scarce in RBY, being a Normal-type move means that it hits nothing super effectively. It can be only used in the situation where your opponent is faster than you but it is at a very, very low HP. You will only see this move in UU and below.</p>
