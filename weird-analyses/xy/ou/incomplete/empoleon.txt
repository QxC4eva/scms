
Overview
########
Unique Water/Steel typing grants it TEN resistances and one immunity
Great 84/88/101 defenses allow it to function as a special wall
Can switch rather easily due to Toxic Spikes immunity and a resistance to SR
Base 111 Special Attack lets it hit hard while still walling
Common weaknesses to Fighting, Ground and Electric attacks
Relatively slow base 60 Speed
Nerf to Steel means it won't be taking Dark/Ghost attacks as well
No means of reliable recovery
Lack of special boosting moves and a lackluster special movepool


Specially Defensive
########
name: Special Wall
move 1: Scald
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Defog
move 4: Roar / Toxic / Ice Beam
ability: Torrent
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpDf
nature: Calm

Moves
========
Scald's chance to cripple physical attackers is invaluable, and when it comes off a base 111 SAtk it is going to hurt
Stealth Rock is an amazing entry hazard, and Empoleon is the only bulky Water type with access to it that also resists it
Roar prevents Empoleon from being setup fodder
Toxic can be used to cripple special attackers and opposing walls, but keep in mind that it may conflict with Scald's burn chance
Ice Beam provides extra coverage against Grass and Dragon types
Empoleon's access to Defog allows it to clear entry hazards then set up its own
Alternatively Protect allows Empoleon to scout moves and stall for burn/poison damage as well as Leftovers recovery

Set Details
========
HP EVs ensure Empoleon takes minimal damage from SR/Leech Seed while the SpDf EVs boost its already great special bulk
A Calm nature is used to capitalize on Empoleon's special bulk
Leftovers provides much needed passive healing

Usage Tips
========
Can be used as a mid-game hazard setter thanks to its numerous resistances
Empoleon's niche in OU comes from being a bulky Defog user who resists SR
If your team already has a SR setter Toxic is the best alternative
Roar on the last slot to phaze Manaphy, one of the most important threats that Empoleon walls, and is also very useful against CM Clefable and CroCune

Team Options
========
Wish support is highly beneficial, and physically defensive Clefable or Sylveon have great synergy with Empoleon
Gliscor and Landorus-T make great teammates and pivots, resisting all of Empoleon's weaknesses whilst Empoleon resists all of their weaknesses

Other Options
########
Icy Wind can be used to slow down a predicted switch
Yawn can pseudo-phase and give Empoleon a free turn to set up
Knock Off cripples mons that rely on items for damage output/recovery
A SubPetaya set can be used as a late game sweeper, although it is heavily outclassed

Checks & Counters
########
Vaporeon and specially defensive Jellicents wall Empoleon entirely, absorbing its STABS and taking a pittance from it's other coverage moves
Any Electric/Fighting type that can take a Hydro Pump can easily shut down Empoleon with its STABs
Ferrothorn is another great counter; even physically defensive variants can take Ice Beams and hit back hard with Power Whip
