The wielder's Defense cannot be lowered.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder's Defense stat cannot be lowered. It does not prevent self-inflicted Defense drops, such as the Defense drop from <a href="/bw/moves/superpower">Superpower</a>. It also does not block the effects of <a href="/bw/moves/haze">Haze</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/heart_swap">Heart Swap</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/guard_swap">Guard Swap</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Moves that lower Defense are scarce if not nonexistent competitively, meaning anything with access to Big Pecks always has a better option, such as <a href="/bw/abilities/hydration">Hydration</a> for <a href="/bw/pokemon/swanna">Swanna</a> or <a href="/bw/abilities/super_luck">Super Luck</a> for <a href="/bw/pokemon/unfezant">Unfezant</a>. That said, everything with access to Big Pecks is pretty much competitively poor anyway, so don't expect to ever need an alternative.</p>
