<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Aerial Ace is yet another of a whole host of low-power physical Flying-type moves, rubbing shoulders with Pluck, Sky Drop, and Wing Attack among others. Of these, Aerial Ace is perhaps the most interesting, not only because it has the widest circulation of any of these moves, but also because of its nice effect, which can really help with your blood pressure by reducing the number of times you have to rage at your computer monitor because you've just lost a battle due to missing at a critical time. Sadly, its low power makes it pretty much useless for most Pokemon, even those that don't have a better STAB move. The only real exception to this rule is Scyther, who thanks to its Technician ability can bump up Aerial Ace's Base Power to 90, making it a pretty decent STAB attack to use.</p>
