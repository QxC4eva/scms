[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage to the last foe to hit the user with a physical attack this turn. The damage is equal to twice the HP lost by the user from that attack. If that foe's position is no longer in use, damage is done to a random foe in range. Only the last hit of a multi-hit attack is counted. Fails if the user was not hit by a foe's physical attack this turn. Counter will not return damage dealt to a Substitute. Counter will activate a held Fighting Gem, but the damage output will not be affected. This move has a priority of -5 and doesn't affect Ghost-types, but hits all other Pokemon for the same damage regardless of type advantages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Counter is a niche move; it's a attack that makes the user goes last and can deal massive damage if used correctly. So, it requires some degree of prediction and the surprise value to work on most situations. Nevertheless, the most common user of this move is definitely Wobbuffet, thanks to its ability Shadow Tag, preventing the opponent from simply switching away, as well as Encore and great defensive stats. Another strategy that is sometimes employed is "CounterCoat," where the Pokemon in question has both Counter and Mirror Coat, thus covering both attacking sides.</p>
