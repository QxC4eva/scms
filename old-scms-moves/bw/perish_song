[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All active Pokemon that hear the song faint after 3 turns. If an individual Pokemon switches out before it faints, then the effect on that Pokemon is canceled. If a Pokemon uses Baton Pass while it has a perish count, the replacement will gain the perish count and continue to count down. This move cannot be blocked by Protect or Detect. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Perish Song is a great move to use on stall teams, as it can force set-up sweepers to switch out and avert danger. It should be emphasized that the desired effect of Perish Song is how it forces the opponent to switch, rather than KO the target. That said, there is a particular strategy that employs Mean Look to prevent the opponent from switching. Murkrow is the best user of this strategy, since with Prankster it has priority on these move and Roost. Defensive Politoed is another notable user of Perish Song, as it can stop threats such as Calm Mind Jirachi, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Baton Pass teams.</p>
