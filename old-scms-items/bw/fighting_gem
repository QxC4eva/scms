<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder uses a damage-dealing Fighting-type move, then the holder consumes this item and the power of that move is increased by 50%. One-time use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In single battles, Fighting Gem is not typically a useful item, unfortunately. While the one-time boost to Fighting-type attacks is nice, most Pokemon using Fighting-type attacks would rather have the more reliable power of Life Orb or Choice items. It can potentially be used by Unburden Hitmonlee in order to activate its ability, but this strategy only works once, and is usually quite unreliable.</p>

<p>Typically Gems are more valuable in the VGC and similar environments, and Fighting Gem is often used here to boost the power of Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Pokemon such as Hitmontop. The one-time power boost can come in very useful in such a fast-paced metagame, especially as it comes without any drawbacks. In addition, it can be used to increase the power of the priority moves Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Occur randomly in Dust Clouds.</p>
