<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Aura Sphere is a moderately powerful and reliable Fighting-type attack with very limited distribution. The perfect accuracy is a nice bonus, but the real lure of the move comes from its use as the only reliable special Fighting-type move in the game, which provides excellent coverage for almost any Pokemon. Where most special sweepers have to resort to the annoyingly inaccurate Focus Blast or the underpowered Hidden Power Fighting, Pokemon with access to Aura Sphere can attack away with no accuracy issues and few power complaints. Lucario is the move's signature user and welcomes Aura Sphere on any of his specially-based sets. Togekiss is granted near perfect coverage with a combination of Aura Sphere and Air Slash. In the Uber tier, Mewtwo often carries Aura Sphere for the excellent coverage between Aura Sphere and Psystrike.</p>
