But especially team Galactic!), thanks you everyone who hooted and hollared for me at the VGC's, and a special shout out to Katai Who had to listen to me for the last 3 months, then the whole car ride down, and the whole car ride back. Your awesome girl!</p>

<p>So it was a nice morning, I got up, fed my goats, fed the pets i was house sitting for, and got a call from a good friend of mine saying "Please promise me this, wear something a little revealing! and send me a picture!" So I headed back home and changed into something pinker, lol.</p>

<p>After getting Katai, we hit the road! Traffic was good untill we hit the bay bridge, at which point i was ready to drive my car off said bridge. GAH! Lucky Katai assured me we would be there soon and paniced as she finished her team. Yay for procrastination!!! :D</p>

<p>We arrived, and got into a VERY long line. rumors flew about lottery, hearts sank, and a lovely gentleman named Ben was giving away TM's and pokemon! Great, because I forgot to put explosion on my Bronzong it turns out. We also met a lot of very nice people, including Tara who I was about to destroy.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/vgc/2010_sanfran_magickzzl_02.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Finally we got it, and Katai and I went NUTS!!</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/vgc/2010_sanfran_magickzzl_03.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<h2>Round 1</h2>
<p>I dont remember as much as I would like sadly, but I went up against my new friend Tara. She lead with Ho-Oh and Jolteon, I sent out Betty and BobRoss. She called back Ho-Oh and sent out Garchomp. I taunted and protected like Im supposed to, and Jolteon hit Betty, knocking her to 50% and paralizing. Nice. Next turn I Ice sharded gar, almost taking it out, and dragon clawed jolteon, not thinking... I dont remember what she did but next turn i ice sharded and dclawed chomp sending it out, and ho-oh is back in. ice sharded ho-oh, and used shadow force. eventualy got the Jolti taken out and ho-oh and she sent out vaporeon. I wittled it down with Dclaw and night slash, and it endedup taking out a very weak BobRoss. I sent in palkia and made a MAJOR NOOB MISTAKE. Yes, I did it. I totaly surfed. killed Betty, and so ChuckNoris came out, and i heard some giggles from the crowd, appaerently this battle was live. Nice, ya'll saw That. So ya, thundered Vap and game over, I won my first round!! But I knew I had to get my head in the game and stop playing like a nOOB.</p>

<h2>Round 2</h2>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/vgc/2010_sanfran_magickzzl_04.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>I went up against this guy Joshua. His Girl was there cheering him on, and oh ya, this one was live on the moniter to. I think he was a little cocky, but nice enough. of course after my last performance he should have been cocky. that was terrible! but done. He sent out Orge/Palkia. I thought "Damn, Im doomed." as Betty and BobRoss headed out. I of course FO/Protect to scout, and DClaw Palkia, who goes down without a fight. Totaly astonished I work on Ogre who goes down pretty easily aswell, didnt even have to whip out BillyMays! Next comes Charizard and Obamasnow. strange. obama takes out BobRoss so I send in BillyMays and FB him and he goes down.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/vgc/2010_sanfran_magickzzl_05.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>They look GOOD. lol, Char goes down without much of a fight and ChuckNoris never even makes an apearence.</p>

<h2>Round 3</h2>
<p>Wow! I made it this far! I follow a guy who actually leads me to the exit first, then sends me back. I get paired with a very tiny little guy, just turned 13. I knew he was trouble. We sat down to fight and out comes Palkia/Ogre. More raindance, Im doomed! maybe this guy doesnt ev train either? no such luck. He tok my team out so fast. I got Palkia taken out with BobRoss but Billy was KO' before getting a hit off and Everything went down hill. He had a kingdra that just about ripped my tea apart almost single handedly. Yes, a classic raindance team. I shoulda known.</p>

<p>So I got out, was congratulated by Marriland and got all fangirl on him</p>
