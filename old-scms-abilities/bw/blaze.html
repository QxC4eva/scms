<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is at 1/3 HP or less, all of its Fire-type moves will have 50% more power.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Blaze is usually exclusive only to the Fire-type starter Pokemon, and is their only ability. However, the advent of Dream World has brought some more usable options, such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/blaziken">Blaziken</a>'s <a href="/bw/abilities/speed_boost">Speed Boost</a>, or <a href="/bw/pokemon/emboar">Emboar</a>'s <a href="/bw/abilities/reckless">Reckless</a>. However, there are times when Blaze can be effective. Whereas the high prevalence of priority attacks and sandstorm has made it a less effective option, using <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a> to bring a Pokemon's HP into the range of Blaze and a pinch Berry was an option at one point (most notably for <a href="/bw/moves/belly_drum">Belly Drum</a> <a href="/bw/pokemon/charizard">Charizard</a>). Nowadays, however, Blaze is simply a last-ditch attempt to deal some damage before the Pokemon goes down.</p>
