Issue 37 of The Smog is live!
Nov 22, 2014
<p>Did you notice that this issue was released much quicker than other issues have been lately? We're now switching to a predictable (and consistent) release schedule, meaning that release happens once every four weeks from now on. Or at least we're going to try to make it as consistent as possible!</p>

<p>In other news, this issue was chock full of articles. The user formerly known as Goddess Briyella headed a gigantic project involving over 10 writers, which discussed the brand new ORAS megas! Level 51 made an even tougher Puzzle Page than last time, and Layell wrote an article on a day in the life of a sprite leader (and why no sane person would want to take on the job).</p>
           
<p>We hope you enjoy this issue guys, it can be found here <a href="/smog/issue37/">here</a>. Also we hope you're enjoying ORAS... we certainly will be (in between putting together issue 38, of course!) ~skylight</p>
