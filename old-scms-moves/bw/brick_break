[SHORT DESC]
Destroys Light Screen and Reflect, then hits. Does not break screens if the target is immune.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and removes the effects of Reflect and Light Screen unless the target is immune to Fighting-type attacks or the move misses because of evasion or accuracy modifiers. This occurs before the damage is calculated, so the move will not be weakened by Reflect.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Brick Break has suffered considerably in the fifth generation, as it is no longer the most powerful drawback-free physical Fighting-type move in the game. Drain Punch is now generally superior, as it has equal power but a far better secondary effect, and more powerful attacks such as Close Combat and Superpower are still more commonly seen. Brick Break may see some use, however, on Pokemon which do not learn a better Fighting-type move, such as Salamence, and on teams which greatly fear dual screens, particularly when combined with Baton Pass.</p>
