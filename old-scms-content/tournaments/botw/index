<h2>Introduction to Battle of the Week</h2>
<p>The Battle of the Week is a program designed to allow the users of Smogon to pick and choose which battles they want to see. If you've been unable to watch battles between top players because they choose to play on a deserted server or at the wrong times, this is your chance to watch a battle between the top players as it is played. If you still can't be on, you will still get to watch the battlers go head to head at a later date by watching it on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SmogonU">Smogon YouTube Channel</a>, because all battles in this program will be recorded and uploaded there. Alternatively, you may read about it here, in the <a href="/tournaments/botw/archive">Archive section</a>. Additionally, The Smog plans to deliver relevant, insightful, and interesting information about the battle and the battlers themselves.</p>
