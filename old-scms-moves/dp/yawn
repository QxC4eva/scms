[SHORT DESC]
Puts the target to sleep after 2 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Puts the target to sleep at the end of the second turn. Yawn ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers. Yawn will not cause the target to fall asleep if the target switches out or leaves the field via Baton Pass or U-turn.
</p>

<p>Yawn fails if the target has a status effect at the time of use or if Safeguard is in effect for the target's party at the time of use. Insomnia and Vital Spirit do not cause Yawn to fail, but the target will not fall asleep if it still has Insomnia or Vital Spirit at the end of the next turn.</p>
