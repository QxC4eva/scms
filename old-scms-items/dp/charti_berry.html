<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Rock-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed during the damage calculation. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Rock-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Being a type-resist Berry, the Charti Berry is useful for Pokemon that are normally checked by super effective Rock-type attacks. That being said, only a select few Pokemon have a major weakness to Rock-type attacks, and even then, these Pokemon have better options that improve their offenses or health. Its best use is on those who absolutely need to survive Rock-type attacks in order to fulfill a goal, such as laying entry hazards or setting up field effects successfully.</p>

<p>Charizard, for example, is one Pokemon that could take advantage of Charti Berry's effect by setting up Dragon Dance or Sunny Day on Stone Edge or Rock Slide. However, without the offensive boost provided by Life Orb, Charizard will fall short of many kills despite the power boost provided by either setup move. Charizard also has multiple weaknesses, so holding the Charti Berry for teams without Rock-type attacks is a wasted endeavor. To an extent, Pokemon using Charti Berry have an inherent Stealth Rock weakness, so attempting to switch into an additional Rock-type attack might not be the best decision.</p>

<p>Although its use is situational, the Charti Berry is seldom seen in competitive play, so sweepers who can capitalize on a weakened Rock-type attack can end up with multiple boosts, surprising the opponent in the process.</p>
