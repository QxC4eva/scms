name: A [ORAS] Offensive Primal Groudon
item: Red Orb
evs: 128 HP / 252 Atk / 128 Spe
nature: Adamant / Naughty
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Precipice Blades / Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge / Fire Punch
move 4: Overheat / Swords Dance / Fire Punch

More offensive Primal Groudon set than what Jibaku posted. Speed EVs outrun scarf 100's after a Rock Polish. EQ is STAB, Stone Edge for flyers (or Fire Punch because its STAB and sun). STAB Sun Overheat from 150 SpA annihilates Gliscor/Landorus-T (otherwise checks). Swords Dance can be used instead to help break stall, scary since Primal Groudon is immune to burns and Thunder Wave. Can run Fire Punch here too if you want a reliable attack to kill Grass-types.

#############
name: A [ORAS] SpDef Primal Groudon
item: Red Orb
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD
nature: Careful
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Precipice Blades
move 3: Rock Slide / Lava Plume
move 4: Thunder Wave / Roar

Specially defensive tank, use it to set up SR, also checks a lot of threatening stuff:

- Counters Kyogre unless its the Primal Form switching in (Specs Ice Beam is only a 3HKO) to overwrite Desolate Land
- Very good Xerneas check - +2 Moonblast doesn't even do half and +2 Focus Blast, the strongest coverage Xerneas has against Primal Groudon, only does 65% max so Groudon easily phazes or paras. Or just smacks it with Precipice Blades which does like 52% min with no investment
- Support Dialga (the standard) gets owned
- Checks Palkia decently (Spacial Rend is the only move that hurts and Palkia needs Lustrous Orb to have a shot at 2HKOing)
- Arceus-Water/Poison/Fairy/Electric all get wrecked
- Can survive 2 4 SpA Judgments from any type-neutral support Arceus

Kyogre and Xerneas are the main reasons to use this though. You can run Impish instead of Careful, you take more damage from Xerneas but you gain the ability to always survive 2 Outrages from Adamant Zekrom after Stealth Rock which is nice. Rock Slide so you're not Ho-Oh bait, Lava Plume is STAB and burns, also denies free switchins to stuff like Landorus-T. Thunder Wave or Roar is your anti Xerneas move, Thunder Wave is good because it also has utility against Arceus formes and Lugia. Toxic is also decent since Steels will not be switching in on this thing
