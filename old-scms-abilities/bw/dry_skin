<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder takes 25% more damage from Fire-type attacks than it ordinarily would, but gains 25% of its maximum HP if hit by a Water-type attack. If rain is the prevailing weather condition, the wielder gains 1/8 of its maximum HP at the end of each turn; if sun is, then it loses 12.5% of its health instead.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Dry Skin is a great ability in an environment where <a href="/bw/abilities/drizzle">Drizzle</a> is usable. Despite the limited distribution of Dry Skin, Pokemon can easily use the 12.5% health regain to their advantage. <a href="/bw/pokemon/toxicroak">Toxicroak</a> is the most notable user of this ability, as it can easily use <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a> and set up <a href="/bw/moves/swords_dance">Swords Dance</a> to sweep, as well as bringing to a halt many common Water-type sweepers.</p>
