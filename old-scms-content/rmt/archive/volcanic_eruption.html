<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/653.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Golurk</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Iron Fist<br />
EVs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Shadow Punch</p>

<p>Golurk is one of the most reliable Stealth Rock setters in the current metagame. Many common leads such as Golem, Regirock, and Armaldo are beaten handily by it. Golurk's sheer bulk makes it very hard to OHKO without a powerful Surf, Ice Beam, or Grass Knot, which allows it to set up Stealth Rocks in nearly every match. Offensively, it's no slouch either; Golurk's gigantic Attack stat allows it to dish out damage consisitently to every Pokemon in the tier due to the perfect coverage it has between its attacks. It also supports the team by adding useful Normal, Electric, and Fighting type immunities. Golurk is usually the initial switch-in to Pokemon such as Tauros, Sawk, and Rotom-S.</p>

<p><strong>Ludicolo</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Swift Swim<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Rain Dance</p>

<p>Ludicolo is one of the most devistating Pokemon in NU simply because of this set. The power and coverage it provides allows it to plow through the many teams that lack a dedicated special wall. Rain Dance allows Ludicolo to sweep at a moment's notice if given a free turn and is extremely useful at breaking down offensive teams. Its typing is also very important as it helps the team take Hydro Pumps from the likes of Samurott, Simipour, and opposing Ludicolo.</p>

<p><strong>Torkoal</strong> @ White Herb<br />
Ability: Shell Armor<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe <br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Shell Smash<br />
- Rapid Spin</p>

<p>Shell Smash Torkoal is one of the coolest sets circulating around the metagame right now. It is one of the only spinners that can get past common Spinblockers like Misdreavus and Golurk. On top of that, it has a huge surprise factor that allows Torkoal to sweep entire teams at times. Fire Blast is extremely powerful after a boost, 2HKOing even dedicated special walls such as Licklicky. It synergises extremely well with Ludicolo; the two form a pseudo Fire / Water / Grass core and can break down Pokemon that give each other trouble. Props to EBeast for popularizing Smashkoal, and to Django for inventing it?!!?! (apparently cbb invented it)</p>

<p><strong>Gurdurr</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Guts<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Bulk Up<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Mach Punch</p>

<p>Meet one of the premier bulky attackers in the tier, Gurdurr. It boasts massive bulk and a great attack stat, which can be pumped up to extremely dangerous levels thanks to Bulk Up and Guts. It has the ability to recover HP with Drain Punch, which helps it immensely when it's matched up against Pokemon such as Samurott and Emboar. There are very few physical attackers, or even physical walls, that can come on top against this beast. Outside of sweeping, Gurdurr can break down bulky Rock and Steel types that wall Skuntank, which greatly increases its utility and usefulness in a match. </p>

<p><strong>Skuntank</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Aftermath<br />
EVs: 20 HP / 252 Atk / 236 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Poison Jab<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Taunt</p>

<p>As strong as Gurdurr may be, it is stopped cold by most Psychic-types in the tier. Skuntank's role is to eliminate those Pokemon by virtue of its typing and move-pool. It is immune to Psychic and takes very little from their coverage move of choice, Signal Beam. With Pursuit, Musharna and friends won't be escaping without having a huge chunk of their health ripped out of them. Skuntank can also provide priority, which is useful for wearing down faster threats as this team is fairly slow.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-S</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Air Slash<br />
- Volt Switch<br />
- Trick<br />
- Thunderbolt</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Rotom-Fan is probably the best user of Choice Scarf in the whole tier. Thanks to Torkoal, Stealth Rocks are usually off the field, which means that Rotom can hop in and out of battle, doing huge amounts of damage to offensive teams and often putting the opponent in a bad position. Huge threats such as Sawk, Braviary, and Samurott are either forced out or killed by Rotom.</p>
