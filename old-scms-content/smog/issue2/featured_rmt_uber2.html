<p>Having built this team a month or more back, I obtained 10th place on the first day, and 4th place the second. I could have laddered more, but i didn't see much point in going any higher as at the time third was around 1810, and I was at 1758. The team was very successful, and covers many common threats.</p>

<p>The team was built to counter common leads at the time, take other teams by surprise with rare threats, yet maintain balance and switching power with a number of resistances, immunities, and of course, two of the best walls in the game!</p>

<h3>In Depth</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/505.png" alt="Shaymin-s" />
<pre>Shaymin-s @ Choice Scarf
Ability: Serene Grace
EVs: 6 Def/252 Spd/252 SAtk
Timid nature (+Spd, -Atk)
- Air Slash
- Seed Flare
- Earth Power
- Leaf Storm</pre></div>

<p>Shaymin-S is an utter beast! Leaf Storm OHKOes most Kyogre and Groudon, where as Seed Flare doesn't! Shaymin-S out speeds Scarf Darkrai and standard Deoxys and Air Slashes for flinchy justice! Earth power is generally just filler, stops the rare uber Heattran, and of course Lucario + low health Scarf Dialga. Seed flare is just there to put holes in stuff if it gets the drop.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/248.png" alt="Tyranitar" />
<pre>Tyranitar (M) @ Choice Scarf
Ability: Sand Stream
EVs: 252 Atk/220 Spd/38 SDef
Jolly nature (+Spd, -SAtk)
- Crunch
- Stone Edge
- Fire Punch
- Pursuit</pre></div>

<p>Scarf Tar is a monster! Just enough Speed to get the Lati's and rape them with Crunch! It's also my best check vs SD Rayquaza! I used to have Ice Punch over Pursuit, but Pursuit's been working pretty well. Stone Edge is there to hurt Lugia, Crunch for the abundant Psychic-types, and Fire Punch for Forretress and Skarm in the sun, and of course hurts U-turning Scizor (although i don't really leave him in against Scizor!).</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/450.png" alt="Garchomp" />
<pre>Garchomp (M) @ Choice Band
Ability: Sand Veil
EVs: 252 Atk/252 Spd/6 SDef
Jolly nature (+Spd, -SAtk)
- Earthquake
- Dragon Claw
- Outrage
- Stone Edge</pre></div>

<p>OH NO! Chomp chomp chomp! ManiaclyRasist inspired me to use this guy! He's such a total beast, he rips apart many of the common uber walls with his gargantuan attack and movepool. Stone Edge for Lugia and Rayquaza, Earthquake for like everything it hits for neutral. Outrage is there if I need something dead quick, e.g. CM Kyogre or SD Groudon (Or even Giratina) e.t.c. Dragon Claw is for killing slower dragons.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/379.png" alt="Registeel" />
<pre>Registeel @ Leftovers
Ability: Clear Body
EVs: 252 HP/40 Def/216 SDef 
Careful nature (+SDef, -SAtk)
- Thunder Wave
- Stealth Rock
- Ice Punch
- Explosion</pre></div>

<p>Haha, this guy may seem like a total gimmick at first, but he is just amazing. His typing and base stats allows him to switch into the best attacking type in Ubers with ease (Dragon). He can then SR on the switch, or catch something with Tave. Ice Punch is to hurt Sub Latias / Latios until it runs out of hp to make subs, which is where i explode / T-wave. Ice Punch also stops outraging Rayquaza. Explodes on whatever it needs to, but I try to keep him alive as long as i can due to his handiness!</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/249.png" alt="Lugia" />
<pre>Lugia @ Leftovers
Ability: Pressure
EVs: 208 HP/166 Def/136 Spd
Bold nature (+Def, -Atk)
- Calm Mind
- Ice Beam
- Roost
- Thunder Wave</pre></div>

<p>I don't belive for a minute that adding Lugia onto any team will not improve it. He's possibly the best wall ever, since not only can he wall, he can pressure stall, and CM and set up a sweep late game, when he's my last chance of a win. He's saved me many a time! Ice Beam helps VS dragons and Groudon, T-Wave is on here for more paralysis support. He easily wins MVP ^_^</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/489.png" alt="Palkia" />
<pre>Palkia @ Choice Scarf
Ability: Pressure
EVs: 252 Spd/252 SAtk/6 SDef
Timid nature (+Spd, -Atk)
- Surf
- Spacial Rend
- Thunder
- Draco Meteor</pre></div>

<p>My last scarfer! Scarf Palkia is monstrous, Draco Meteor rips holes into many walls, and offers a quick K.O. on whatever it hits for S.E. Spacial Rend is just a great move, can easily start a late game sweep. Thunder is there for Kyogre, Lugia and other Water Types or Flyers that are around. Surf is a great move, since most teams in Ubers cary a Kyogre, i can come in on Kyogre, predict a switch, and hit their Palkia counter for massive damage. Easily the best Palkia set in my opinion, along with the Sub Lustrous Orber. A valuable asset to this team.</p></div>

<p>A quick look at this team shows that it uses 5 Pok&eacute;mon that are relatively common in Ubers, and Registeel, a Pok&eacute;mon that while not seen too often in ubers, works wonders in the metagame. Upon reading the team you will see that the team relies heavily on prediction, using 4 Choiced users to weaken the opposition through brutal force. The only 2 Pok&eacute;mon that do not carry choice items make up a solid defensive core, with Lugia taking physical hits like a champ and Registeel soaking up most Special Attacks with ease thanks to its huge Special Defense stat. Attacks that neither of them take particularly well are played around via resistances, like Choice Specs Kyogre Water Spout for example, which is taken by Palkia thanks to it's 4x resistance.</p>

<p>This team also shows how effective Shaymin-S is as an anti lead in the ubers metagame. Air Slash makes quick work of Deoxys-E and Darkrai thanks to its amazing flinch rate. Taking out Deoxys-E without it managing to get Spikes up is very important to Ace's team since 3 of his 4 choice users take Spikes damage, which severely hampers his strategy and forces him to play much more conservatively as opposed to being able to play recklessly and still manage to get some KOs. 2 Grass typed moves may seem like a stupid idea on Shaymin-S, but in Ubers, Pressure is the dominant trait. Pressure means that Shaymin S can only fire off 4 Seed Flares as opposed to the normal 8, and this number will deplete even faster when Shaymin is forced into it by it's Choice Scarf. Leaf Storm is the secondary choice as a grass move. Leaf Storm OHKOs Kyogre 100% of the time, something Seed Flare cannot do. It should also be mentioned that 9/16ths of the time Shaymin S' Air Slash will not 2HKO Darkrai, which means Darkrai may potentially beat it.</p>

<p>This team also utilizes Scarf Tyranitar, an often overlooked Uber revenge killer. Scarf Tar provides Ace with a great SDRay check (similar to the way ScarfTran checks SDLuke in OU) and is also a very solid way to revenge kill the Lati twins. The Lati twins are likely to stay in and try to harm Tyranitar with a Calm Minded attack after it switches in with no Leftovers recovery, which will make the opponent think its Specially Defensive Choice Band Tar. Ace can also easily bluff this as Special Defensive Tar since he runs the exact same moveset barring Fire Punch. Tyranitar also provides a very nice check to Lucario, who's popularity in Ubers is growing. Tyranitar also provides the very important Sandstorm for Garchomp's Sand Veil ability to activate.</p>

<p>No team is perfect though, including this team. Ace's team has a bit of trouble with stall, and he must predict perfectly in order to defeat it. Any team with 4 choiced users will likely have similar problems. Forretress can easily set up Spikes against his Registeel and phazers like Skarmory or Lugia can easily Whirlwind to rack up Spikes damage. Wobbufett can also easily wreck Ace's defensive core, easily trapping and Encoring Registeel's Stealth Rock, or even it's weak Ice Punchs. Lugia is also easily trapped and Encored. Palkia's -2 Draco Meteors are also Mirror Coat fodder for Wobbuffet. Infact, every one of Ace's choiced users can be taken out by Wobbuffet in one way or another. Taunt Calm Mind Mewtwo can also pose a problem as Ace is forced to Explode his Registeel, which is also his only Dragon resist.</p>
