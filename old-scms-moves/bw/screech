Lowers target's Defense by 2 stages.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Defense by two stages. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Like all other stat-lowering moves, Screech's effect is nullified by the simple act of switching out, which usually pushes Screech into relative obscurity on the competitive scene. However, it does have an interesting, though somewhat gimmicky, use when paired with a Pursuit user. As the opponent is likely to switch out after getting hit by Screech lest they face a powerful hit, your Pokemon is free to nail them with Pursuit as they try to flee, smacking them in their still-lowered Defense stat.</p>
