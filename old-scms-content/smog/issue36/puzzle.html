<p>
	Welcome, one and all, to The Smog's inaugural Puzzle Page! We've spiced things up a little by replacing the Trivia section with something a little more dynamic; in addition, we've put together a slightly better pool of prizes. We hope you'll enjoy the puzzles we've created&mdash;we sure enjoyed crafting them! Before we begin, however, let's congratulate Valmanway for their quick answer to last issue's trivia, earning them a custom title! Please approach your friendly resident administrator to collect your prize.
</p>

<h2>Parameter Puzzles</h2>
<p>
	Your challenge for these questions is to obtain the given list of Pok&eacute;mon from the /dexsearch command on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! using the correct number of parameters as shown! Note that "all" does not count as a parameter. Can you figure out which parameters were used to obtain these results?
</p>

<p>
	Use the command "/dexsearch" for a quick introduction on how the command works. The first three users to send in all 10 correct answers will earn themselves a custom title on the Smogon Forums; failing which, the first three users with the highest scores will earn these custom titles instead!
</p>

<h2>Mystery Sound</h2>
<p>
	Do you consider yourself a well-traveled denizen of the Pok&eacute;mon world, able to recognize a tune from just a few bars of sound? Well, this is the challenge for you! Simply guess which of the main Pok&eacute;mon games and from which location in the game this clip comes from. The first two users to send in the correct answer will win themselves a custom title on the Smogon Forums!

<h2>Crossword</h2>
<p>
	And here we have it: the Grand Finale for our first Puzzle Page! To participate, simply fill out the crossword grid below with what you believe are the right answers, and send a screenshot of the grid to us. The first person to send in a completely correct grid will, for the first time ever, win themselves a custom avatar on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! Should you be the lucky winner, more details concerning the prize will be sent to you later.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, and if the clues seem a bit cryptic, it's because they are! Here's a hint, though: all of the answers are Pok&eacute;mon names. There! That makes it significantly easier, doesn't it?
