<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The best possible Pokemon for an in-game team are the ones that are obtained at the start of the game, can OHKO enemies easily, take little damage from nearly any enemy, can learn many HMs, can heal themselves, can learn useful moves upon level up, don't need excessive TMs, and have a useful ability. Such a Pokemon doesn't exist, of course, but this means that Pokemon closer to this ideal are obviously the best ones to use.</p>

<p>The goal of this in-game tier list is to recommend a select group of Pokemon for an efficient run through the game. The ones that fit most of the above requirements are placed in the high tier. Very inefficient Pokemon will be put in the low tier. Things that are neither efficient nor inefficient, for example Pokemon that have some opportunity costs but don't end up as good as high tiered ones, will be put in the middle tier.</p>

<p>Don't confuse an efficient run with a speed run. Speed runs are often ones that are segmented and recorded with luck manipulation through resets, and aim for the absolute fastest time recorded, but the real time spent on them is usually much more. Just assume you want to play through in a relatively fast time frame. The most efficient team size for these runs is only one member, but if one doesn't assume something more like 3 members, the resulting in-game tier lists become incredibly centralized around Pokemon you get early on in the game rather than anything encountered later on. Also note when reading through this guide that some of the moves and abilities listed for a Pokemon may only be obtained by their evolutions. Some Pokemon may be placed in higher tiers due to their evolutions capabilities as well.</p>
