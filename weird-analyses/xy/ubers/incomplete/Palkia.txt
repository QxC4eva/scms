    SET NAME
    ########
    name: Offensive
    move 1: Hydro Pump / Surf
    move 2: Spacial Rend / Draco Meteor
    move 3: Fire Blast
    move 4: Thunder / Rest
    ability: Pressure
    item: Lustrous Orb / Assault Vest
    nature: Timid
    evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

    Moves
    ========
    - Hydro Pump is your primary STAB option. With the weather nerf it is a mixed blessing for Palkia, but the lack of Dragons swarming Ubers makes Hydro Pump a solid offensive option.
    - Surf can be used if the accuracy is annoying.
    - Fire Blast eliminates Ferrothorn and is Palkia's best attack against Groudon in sunlight.
    - Thunder is there since Palkia is one of the best checks to Kyogre.
    - Spacial Rend offers sustained power while Draco Meteor allows Palkia to be a nuke on the occasion.
    - Rest can also work on Palkia to beat non-Calm Mind Kyogre one-on-one. Use it over Thunder as otherwise Ferrothorn is a free switch-in. Also if Palkia is using Rest Spacial Rend is a must.
    - Not listed, but Outrage is an option to 2HKO Blissey with Stealth Rock on the field. A Hasty nature is required.
    - Dragon Tail can be a usable option to prevent Pokemon such as Kyogre from setting up Calm Mind.


    Set Details
    ========
    - Standard EVs optimized to Palkia's performance.
    - Modest is an option but it's mainly for trading any capability of revenge killing for raw power.
    - Lustrous Orb is the best item due to its consistent power without any drawback. Fire Blast and Thunder are more for coverage moves while Palkia should focus on hitting targets with its great dual-STABs.
    - Assault Vest sacrifices power to allow Palkia to soak up Kyogre even better. It's about the closest you'll get to Latias with Soul Dew.
    - Leftovers is an alternative item to use; especially if Palkia is using Rest.
    - Haban Berry is a good item to help Palkia absorb Dragon-type attacks and retaliate with its own.

    Usage Tips
    ========
    - Palkia is often treated with two purposes - it is seen as an offensive threat while being one of the best checks to non-Calm Mind Kyogre.
    - Controlling weather and being able to predict the weather is paramount to using Palkia. Rain is Palkia's best friend; however, Palkia does not necessarily hate sunlight either.
    - Assault Vest should only be considered if you desperately need to check Kyogre and your team is completely crippled by it.
    - Caution should be used when facing some of the potentially slower threats. For example, there are times where Zekrom may or may not be using Choice Scarf.
    - If you plan to use Rest on Palkia Leftovers is a necessary item to use.

    Team Options
    ========
    - Having either Kyogre or Groudon really benefits Palkia. Kyogre is recommended more due to rain playing nicer with Palkia's STAB Hydro Pump as well as accurate Thunder. Sunlight isn't bad, though, since Groudon brings Palkia a boosted Fire Blast to prevent threats such as Ferrothorn from thinking of switching in twice. Groudon also brings nice utility with Stealth Rock and possibly Thunder Wave.
    - Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas are two of the biggest threats to Palkia. Aegislash is great for taking these threats head-on. Ho-oh works well as it applies pressure to Grass Arceus. Steel Arceus also doesn't match up badly. Chansey and Blissey also can status both of these threats and wear them down with Seismic Toss. Beware of Xerneas Close Combat.
    - Palkia is fairly quick but it does often miss the benchmark against some of the faster Pokemon. Threats such as Scarf Zekrom, Mewtwo, and Arceus can help remedy those situations.
    - Other Dragon-types can threaten Palkia if they're faster. Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy can do well in checking or countering these threats.
    - Chansey and Blissey are really nasty for Palkia. Deploying heavy physical attackers such as Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Gengar does wonders for Palkia.
    - Speaking of Chansey and Blissey having Heal Bell or Aromatherapy for Rest Palkia is not a bad idea.


    SET NAME
    ########
    name: Choice Specs
    move 1: Hydro Pump / Surf
    move 2: Draco Meteor / Spacial Rend
    move 3: Thunder
    move 4: Fire Blast
    ability: Pressure
    item: Choice Specs
    nature: Timid
    evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

    Moves
    ========
    - Choice Specs is all about power, so it comes as no surprise that Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor are the primary options for Palkia.
    - Surf and / or Spacial Rend can also be used if you want consistency of power or accuracy in the scenario of Surf.
    - Thunder and Fire Blast are mainly for coverage, though sun-boosted Fire Blast on Specs is really scary.


    Set Details
    ========
    - Timid with max Special Attack and Speed for obvious reasons.
    - Modest works but Timid is great for its Speed tier.
    - You know do I really have to explain Choice Specs lol?

    Usage Tips
    ========
    - Carry Kyogre with you if you can. Rain-boosted Hydro Pumps (or Surfs if you're a pussy) really fucking hurt.
    - Ample prediction is necessary to succeed with this set. Bear in mind that Fairies are immune to Dragon-type moves, so locking into Spacial Rend or Draco Meteor is much easier to punish than it was in previous generations.
    - Though the sun might be depressing on Palkia's STAB Water-type attack moves, Specs Fire Blast in the sun is really powerful.

    Team Options
    ========
    - Kyogre pls
    - Mega Gengar can handle blobs
    - Aegislash can screw over fairies
    - Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Groudon can all set up Stealth Rock support. Tyranitar can at least neutralize the weather effects while Groudon boosts Fire Blast at the cost of halving Surf or Hydro Pump.
    - Xerneas / Arceus Fairy can handle Dragons that could possibly be faster than Palkia (i.e. Scarf Zekrom).



    SET NAME
    ########
    name: Choice Scarf
    move 1: Hydro Pump
    move 2: Draco Meteor / Spacial Rend
    move 3: Thunder
    move 4: Fire Blast
    ability: Pressure
    item: Choice Scarf
    nature: Timid
    evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

    Moves
    ========
    - Hydro Pump is being used for obvious reasons.
    - Draco Meteor is preferred slightly on this set as the immediate power can bring great rewards when revenge killing. Spacial Rend is still good for consistency.
    - Thunder and Fire Blast help Palkia stay as a good check for Kyogre as well as being able to handle sunlight with Groudon.

    Set Details
    ========
    - Most optimal EVs.
    - Again Modest can be used though beware of Timid Scarf Reshiram and +1 Jolly Rayquaza.

    Usage Tips
    ========
    - Choice Scarf isn't as great as it was in previous generations. It's rather weak and doesn't exactly help Palkia check Kyogre very well. Still, it is a functional set if your team needs a solid Choice Scarf Pokemon and you're strapped for options.
    - Scarf Palkia is designed more to be a revenge killer. It can pull off a lategame sweep; however, the enemy team has to be thoroughly worn out.
    - Ample prediction is necessary to succeed with this set as the lock onto specific moves can mean trouble for your team.


    Team Options
    ========
    - See above.
    - Walls such as Blissey and Chansey need to be cleared much faster, though. Also beware of the Dragon lock against Fairy-types.


    Other Options
    ########
    - Toxic handles Xerneas, Fairy Arceus, and other switch-ins.
    - Sleep Talk can be used on the Rest set but it isn't a good idea.
    - Chesto Berry can also be used on the Rest set but again doesn't work well. The point of Rest is to cure status and beat defensive Kyogre one-on-one. It isn't really for recovering health.
    - Substitute + Focus Punch set can be used to beat Blissey; however, Focus Punch and Spacial Rend are walled by many Pokemon in the Uber tier now.


    Checks & Counters
    ########
    - The biggest way to counter / check Palkia pends completely on the weather and what moves are boosted / weakened with it. In rain Hydro Pump, Spacial Rend, and Thunder will be used often. In the sunlight Fire Blast and Spacial Rend will see more usage.
    - Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy can switch into a lot of Palkia's attacks and easily scare Palkia off with their STAB Fairy-type attacks. Beware of rain-boosted Hydro Pumps.
    - Blissey and Chansey completely wall Palkia without Outrage. These threats can poison Palkia and wear it down with Seismic Toss.
    - Ferrothorn can take on Palkia when it is raining, though Ferrothorn suffers massive damage from Fire Blast.
    - In sunlight Lugia serves as a good check to Palkia. In neutral weather it is harder since paralysis can really screw over Lugia's capability of stalling out Palkia.
    - In the rain Aegislash does okay against Palkia. Fire Blast still stings, though.
    - In sunlight Ho-oh does well against it. Hydro Pump still kind of harms it.
    - In the rain Grass Arceus can take all sorts of punishment from Palkia.
