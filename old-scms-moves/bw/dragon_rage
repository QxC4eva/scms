Always does 40 HP damage. 

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This move always deals 40 HP damage. Dragon Rage isn't affected by STAB, weakness, resistance, or any other factors.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Unlike Seismic Toss and Night Shade, which can hit for up to 100 damage, Dragon Rage does a fixed 40 damage per use. This only makes it useful in Little Cup, where the low amounts of HP make it capable of easy OHKOs or 2HKOs; however, because it is almost completely uncounterable, it's banned there, and therefore is not viable competitively.</p>
