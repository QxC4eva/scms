
    Has the bulk of an aircraft carrier
    110 base Speed lets it naturally outspeed every relevant wall bar Arceus
    Reliable recovery (got ya there, 'Tina!)
    Has 2 good abilities to choose from, letting it perform different roles on teams
    Rise of Ghost and Dark-types make its Psychic typing a liablility
    Not too many resistances to take advantage of its gargantuan defenses (4x resist to Fighting is nice tho)
    Stealth Rock weakness prevents Multiscale from working; high hazard management required for it to utilize Multiscale


Great Wall
########
name: Great Wall
move 1: Roost
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Whirlwind / Dragon Tail
move 4: Aeroblast / Substitute / Thunder Wave
ability: Multiscale / Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 170 Def / 80 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

    Roost + Toxic = stall all the things!
    Whirlwind phazes stuff though Subs and hits Fairies, a new primary target for Lugia
    Dragon Tail can rack up residual damage with Toxic and hazards unlike Whirlwind, but is blocked by Sub and you can't phaze Fairies anymore
    Aeroblast can be used as a powerful spammable STAB move that Lugia can utilize, can 2HKO MM2X, also it 2HKO's MegaGar after SR
    Substitute can shield Lugia from Toxic and Taunt, and can annoy the living hell out of anything that can't break through it at the cost of being ironically more vulnerable to Taunt
    T-Wave can cripple sweepers or its usual checks / counters (such as MegaGar) and lets Lugia become a status shuffler with Whirlwind

Set Details
========

    EVs round out both defenses well, lets Lugia become an effective mixed wall
    Bold minimizes damage from Foul Play (Yveltal I'm looking at you)
    Pressure helps Lugia Toxic stall things, while Multiscale can let it check sweepers significantly better
    EVs can be relocated to either Defense or Special Defense depending on your team's needs, and due to Lugia's extremely high defensive stats, being lacking in one of them is not as much as an issue, especially its Special Defense


Usage Tips
========

    Keep SR off field as much as possible if Multiscale is being used
    Be very wary of possible Toxic users (i.e. Scarf Yveltal, Ho-Oh, Donner etc.)
    However, be very generous with using Toxic or Substitute if possible, as catching a switch to something that can check you like Zekrom or Kyogre, and either hit them with a Toxic (makes Kyogre sad unless it's RestTalk), or be able to phaze out certain sweepers / checks behind a Sub and then gtfo
    Try keeping up on predicted switches to let Lugia come in onto an incoming sweeper, and use Whirlwind if the opposing side gets too cheeky with set up moves


Team Options
========

    Clerics like Aromatherapy Xern and Sylveon (Lugia hates Toxic), as they can also take on Dark-types very well with Fairy Aura Moonblast and Pixilate Hyper Voice respectively
    Defog users like Giratina and Arceus can get rid of SR without too much trouble
    Rayquaza and Kyurem-W (my favs) can get rid of Steels that Lugia has trouble with, and appreciate having walls weakened
    Things that can remove stallbreakers (MegaGar comes to mind on both sides of the conflict)
    Groudon can stop Zekrom and Tyranitar, and can set up Stealth Rock for Loogie to shuffle
    Fighting Arceus (ok hear me out), can deal with big-shot Dark-types like Darkrai, Tyranitar and Dark Arceus, and can check Kyurem-W and Ferrothorn
    Palkia can help Lugia with Kyogre, and can Fire Blast Steel-types if they pose an issue (also can Thunder Yveltal)


Other Options
########

    Calm Mind (Lugia faces too much competition from Arceus now for CM to be a main set imo, but feel free to correct me)
    RestTalk
    Dual Screens
    Defog can be used for Lugia to support his team more by clearing all entry hazards, but has to run Pressure in order for it to be legal
    Safeguard
    EQ
    Stone Miss?
    Recover
    Psycho Boost can OHKO MegaGar and MegaBlaze, but doesn't offer much else outside of that, and is again only legal with Pressure
