<div id="interview">
<div class="speaker aside"><p>I nervously wander into the interview room ready to meet my newest guest, Lowgock. Recently, he won the Smogon Grand Slam.</p></div>
<div class="interview speaker laurel"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_laurel.png" alt="laurel" /><p>Did you ever expect to win the Grand Slam when sign ups for UU first went up?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>I guess its everybody's goal to get as high as possible, so while I didn't really expect the win for sure, it was definitely what I aimed for.</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker laurel"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_laurel.png" alt="laurel" /><p>How were you feeling once you knew you secured a spot in the top 8, and how did you prepare from that point on?</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>Well, kind of relieved actually since I got all my points in the first three opens, so I had to pray that there weren't too much people gaining more points in the last opens lol</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>Hmm preparing... I just built some teams and tested with them, nothing spectacular. I did eat in a Chinese restaurant, "bonsai," before every time though, which gave me luck.</p>
  </div>
<div class="speaker aside"><p>First the Indians now the Chinese... looks like Team Asia is going to have another successful WCOP</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker laurel"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_laurel.png" alt="laurel" /><p>Haha, did you have any particular help from ’tier experts’ in any of the tiers you weren’t as familiar with or did you mostly do everything yourself?</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>Famous German VGC player Daflo did familiarize me with VGC some weeks ago, so I wasn't that new to Doubles anymore, and Steeljackal was very helpful with some tips and one team I guess. Oh right and ium checked over the teams, which was a great help as well.</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker laurel"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_laurel.png" alt="laurel" /><p>So it seems like you did a lot yourself but still had some assistance by some of your friends.</p>
  </div>
<div class="speaker aside"><p>I sort through some papers and still cannot find my questions, so I casually toss out what is on my mind</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker laurel"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_laurel.png" alt="laurel" /><p>Are there any tiers you felt more confident with than others going into your playoff matches?</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>I can only say that I didn't really feel that confident in Ubers since it was also the only tier I never really tested myself. Other than that nothing stands out in particular.</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker laurel"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_laurel.png" alt="laurel" /><p>That's definitely understandable. Did you feel any nerves going into your battles?</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>I did made some mistakes I shouldn't have looking back at the matches now, but I don't think I was particularly nervous.</p>
  </div>
<div class="speaker aside"><p>Lowgock takes in a deep breath and looks down</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>I did have diarrhea after every Grand Slam match though... I dunno if was related.</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker laurel"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_laurel.png" alt="laurel" /><p>Perhaps the chinese food?</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>Yeah that's what i was suspecting as well hahahahahah, but I've got Asian roots, there is no way that I cannot tolerate Asian food.</p>
  </div>
<div class="speaker aside"><p>Looks like team Asia found its newest member...</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker laurel"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_laurel.png" alt="laurel" /><p>Anyway how does it feel to to be the first German since DPP was the main tier to win an individual trophy? Did you get any sort of special shout outs?</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>Nearly every German cheered for me and many offered to help me, so that's something I guess. However, I don't think that this would be less great if I wasn't the first German since DPP to achieve something.</p>
</div>
<div class="speaker aside"><p>I see Lowgock looking at my eyes before he abruptly makes another comment</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>Special shoutouts to Sebixxl!</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker laurel"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_laurel.png" alt="laurel" /><p>Lol, my last question was going to be if you had any other special shout outs.</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>I know. I can read your mind. That's why I won.</p>
  </div>
<div class="speaker aside"><p>Feeling a little scared I scurry out of the interview room</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker laurel"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_laurel.png" alt="laurel" /><p>Alright! Take it easy, and thanks for your time!</p>
  </div>
<div class="interview speaker lowgock"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_lowgock.png" alt="lowgock" /><p>No problem</p>
  </div>
