[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage, and the user receives recoil damage equal to 1/3 of the damage dealt, rounded half up, but not less than 1 HP. Has a 10% chance to paralyze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Volt Tackle is an exclusive move of the Raichu line. It's one of the most powerful Electric moves available. However, most of the users have miserable Attack so you won't see it much in competitive matches. Nevertheless, Pikachu can somewhat make use of the move when combined with Light Ball, as it gives Pikachu an incredibly strong physical STAB option to use alongside a possible SubPunch set. However, even then it's rarely seen as Pikachu would more commonly make use of Encore, Substitute, and Nasty Plot in order to deal damage. The insane recoil also makes the move unappealing on a Pokemon with such low HP.</p>
