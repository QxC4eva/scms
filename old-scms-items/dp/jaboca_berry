<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder is hit by a physical attack, the attacker takes 12.5% of its max HP as damage. The holder must survive the hit for this to activate. This damage is not blocked by Rock Head. Pokemon with Magic Guard do not activate this Berry. One-time use.</p>

<p>Provides a one-time 80 Base Power Dragon-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Another Berry that has almost no competitive use, the Jaboca Berry damages an opponent whenever the holder takes damage from a physical attack. This may have been a good item choice, but the fact of the matter is that it only deals out 1/8 of the opponents max HP in damage, which is very mediocre, considering it is one time use and using an attacking move is almost always the better option. Standard items such as Leftovers outclass this in almost every way possible.</p>
