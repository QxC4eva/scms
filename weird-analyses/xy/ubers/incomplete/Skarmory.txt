Moves
========

-Roost is essentially mandatory, recovery is sexy and a must on Skarmory.
-Toxic is also quite ideal as your main form of damage output. Without it, Skarmory is a wall incapable of doing anything besides small chip damage. Taunt can be used instead of it, however, to choke things such as support Defog Arceus on the switch.
-Defog is key, as Skarmory finds the opportunity to use it versus two of the most dangerous threats of this generation (Kangaskhan-Mega and Extremekiller Arceus) as well as making a nice partner for SR-weak Pokemon like Ho-oh generally. Spikes can be used to set up on the aforementioned threats, too.
-The last slot is a tossup-- Whirlwind is key for phazing out threats so they don't boost get too many boosts up on you. Nice for Extremekiller Arceus that thinks it can set up on you. Stealth Rock works on Skarmory much like it did last generation; it isn't very great. Brave Bird actually has legitimate use for hitting Mega-Mewtwo-X and Amoongus, as well as getting chip damage on a few things and being generally awesome in some (albeit not that many) situations.

Set Details
========

-Rocky Helmet is generally better than Leftovers. Getting massive chip damage on whatever tries to make contact with you is very nice, especially for things such as MegaKanga which could otherwise just set up on you with Power Up Punch.

-Bold can be used to reduce Foul Play and confusion damage, but use Impish if you run BB.

-Skarmory can run a Specially Defensive spread to some effect- this lets it take hits from things such as support Arceus better. However, this is pretty bad, as Supportceus pressures you with WoW and it's generally best to have as much physical bulk as possible.

-Twelve Attack EVs can be run if Skarmory is using Brave Bird, to get a guaranteed 2HKO on Gengar-Mega.

Usage Tips
=========

-Skarmory is quite weak versus several prominent special attackers, such as Palkia, Mega-Gengar, and Kyogre. With 65 HP/70 Sdef, it falls to more dangerous attacks, but is capable of taking hits versus things such as support Arceus.

-Its main use, however, is being an incredibly frustrating physical wall that shuts down several prominent physical attackers,(Kangaskhan-Mega, Extremekiller Arceus, Mega-Mewtwo-X, Landorus-T) and it should be played as such.

-There really isn't that much else to say about Skarmory. It's one of the select few solid Extremekiller Arceus checks that packs a recovery move (some may go as far to say that it's an Extremekiller counter), and utterly walling Kangaskhan-Mega is too good to pass up considering how threatening that is. Outside of these threats, Skarmory doesn't have that much walling capability, but this is just enough to niche itself in Ubers.

Team Options
==========

-Skarmory is mildly difficult to build around. It fits well with things that generally take special attacks such as Ho-oh and Assault Vest Palkia, but be sure to have an answer to Zekrom. Note that it's nice to have some form of hazard control with its teammates, as keeping Sturdy intact is ideal so it can take borderline any hit.

-Is more suited to balance than Hyper Offense due to its lack of offensive presence.

-Try to pressure defoggers with teammates, especially if you're running Spikes Skarmory.

-Blissey, Chansey and Sylveon are good alongside it to form a frustrating all-around walling core, but it's very necessary to pack answers to Mega-Gengar and both forms of Blaziken.

-Mega-Tyranitar is acceptable as a teammate, as it can pursuit-trap Mega-Gengar, one of your biggest checks, whilst Skarmory walls Hippowdon and Groudon for it (assuming the latter lacks a Fire move).

Other Options
########

-Rock Slide hits Ho-oh on the switchin.

-Custap Berry is unobtainable (thanks Shellshocker), so Skarmory's Custap set will not be listed in the final analysis.

-Skarmory can run a Specially Defensive of 252 HP / 252 Sdef / 4 Def Careful, to better take hits from support Arceus. As mentioned previously, it isn't all that great.

Checks & Counters
########
-Any Special Atacker with any sort of power or way of hitting you at least neutrally.
-Select Physical Attackers, such as Zekrom and Blaziken can abuse Skarmory's 2 weaknesses. Zekrom's Terravolt means it OHKOs you through Sturdy.
-Ho-oh deserves a special mention as it turns Skarmory lacking Whirlwind into setup fodder for a substitute which can instantly put your team in a worse position.
-This is also the case with Mega-Gengar, as all you can do is phaze it out while it 2HKOs you.
-Kyurem-White and Reshiram, even though they lost most viability, also hurt due to the ability to bypass sturdy and threaten the rest of Skarmory's teammates with powerful special attacks.
