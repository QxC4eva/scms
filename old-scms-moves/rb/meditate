<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Meditate is outclassed by Swords Dance, and should only be used when the latter is unavailable. Moreover, Meditate takes up a moveslot, which could be used instead for another coverage move since its power increase is quite lackluster.</p>
