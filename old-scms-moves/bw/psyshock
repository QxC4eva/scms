<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The target's Defense stat, and not its Special Defense, is used in damage calculation. All other factors work as expected.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Psyshock is primarily used on Psychic-types as a way to hit opponents with a "physical" attack, allowing them to muscle through special walls. The power drop compared to Psychic makes the latter preferred in many situations. However, Psyshock is better for Calm Mind wars.</p>
