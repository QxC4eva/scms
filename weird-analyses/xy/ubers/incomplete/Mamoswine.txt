Overview
########
-Very Underrated Wall Breaker
-May not seem like much if look at stat, most stats are mediocre, only notable base 130 Atk and even that doesn't seem that incredible when compare 150 Atk Uber like Rayquazza and Zekrom
-Frail by Uber Standard and 80 base Spd is slow, and thus often struggle to launch an attack other than Priority Ice Shard against Hyper offensive team.
-However, the wonderful offensive typing and its two STAB, Earthquake and Icicle Crash, really set it apart.
-STAB alone already hit lots of common Stall monsters such as Groudon, Aegislash, Lugia, Giratina, Dialga, and Rockceus super effectively. While things like Kyogre and Ho-Oh doesn't enjoy taking one of its STAB either because they aren't that bulky Physically
-Priority in Ice Shard is also great, picking off faster and weakened monster like Mewtwo and Darkari and revenging Ice weak monsters like Shaymin-S, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Also allow you to anti-lead Deoxys-S.
-Defensively, Electric immunity and SR neutrality is useful. Thick Fat gives it neutrality to Fire and ice resistance. One of the few monster resists the Bolt-beam combo and allow it to counter the dangerous Electric Arceus
-Doesn't change too much compare to Gen 5, Xerneas is a new threat but can take advantage of the new Yveltal and Aegislash

Moves
=========
- STAB Icicle Crash hit many Ice weak pokemon in Uber for shattering damages, notably Groudon, Yveltal, Lugia, Giratina(-O), and others. It is a safer move to throw around in general since many things in Uber are at least neutral if not weak to it. Plus the Flinch rate can be useful at times.
- STAB in Earthquake combo well with Icicle Crash, denting or outright KO things that can take Icicle Crash such as Kyogre, grounded steel type (Scizor, Aegislash, Jirachi, Heatran, Dialga, Genesect, etc), Rock-Arceus, Xerneas, etc. It is even stronger than Icicle Crash.
- Ice Shard allow you to revenge Ice weak targets such as Shaymin-S and pick up faster pokemon that are weakened.
- The fourth move is very expandable since the first three moves already give you everything you need. Superpower is slashed first because it is the best attack for Bronzong, one of your best counter. It also hits Blis/Chansey, Ferrothorn, Extreme-killer before it set up, and Kyerum-W. Stealth Rock is another good move to use if you can't fit it anywhere else in your team. Do note that Mamoswine isn't a very reliable SR monster itself due to its fragility and slow speed.
-Not listed, but Substitute can be used to erase prediction, note that with life Orb, Mamo will lose a great amount of health. Knock Off is another useful move to remove opponent items. Stone edge can also be used to OHKO Physical defensive Ho-Oh but has little use otherwise.

Set Details
=========
-Atk is maximized with Adamant nature to provide maximum power. Jolly nature allows Mamo to outspeed Max speed netural nature 90s but mix out a great deal of power and KO, so it is not recommended. Speed is also maximized to help outspeed most 90 Speed Uber that doesn't invest much in Speed.
- If you wish to conserve EVs, 84 EVs in speed can be used as it still outspeed min 90s that doesn't invest, and you can put the rest in Hp or defense. It is not recommended as your opponent will likely speed creep and even if you successfully speed creep against him, you may end up putting a lot of EVs in Speed and not gaining much bulk anyway.
-Life Orb is the only viable item due to its ability to switch moves and provide consistent power boost

Usage Tips
=========
-Prediction is very important to use Mamo properly, as very few things can switch into it if you have good prediction. For example, Kyogre and Steel type hate Earthquake, Ho-oh, Lugia, Yveltal hate Icicle Crash
-It is difficult to switch Mamo into attacks as it is not bulky at all, so if you predict opponent to use a support move, you can bring it in and wreck havoc.
-When against Hyper Offensive team, Mamo may struggle to launch an Earthquake or Icicle Crash, but priority Ice Shard is still there to pick up frail and weakened monsters
-Choice locked electric attack from the like of Kyogre and Zekrom are also good to take advantage of
-Hate all status, especially burn

Team Options
=========
-Kyogre is a great partner to attract electric attack for Mamo switching into. In return, Kyogre can switch into water and steel moves that Mamo is weak to and destroy Mamo top counters such as Skarmory, Bronzong, and Wall Arceus
-Dialga is another good teammate as it can set up SR more reliably, resisting Water and Steel moves, and roost both Skarmory and Bronzong with Fire Blast.
-Palkia is similar to Dialga minus SR, but it can also switch in against Kyogre more easily
-Zekrom is again resist water and steel, destroy Skarmory and Bronzong, and Mamoswine can lure Groudon in and maul it badly with Icicle Crash, helping Zekrom to Spam Bolt Strike more easily

Other Options
=========
-Icicle Spear is a possible replacement for Icicle Crash, but it is unreliable
-Choice Band and Endeavor lead sucks
-Toxic is an option to cripple wall, most notably support Arceus form that you can't handle

Checks & Counters
########
-It is more difficult to counter Mamo than it may first seem. Mamoswine STAB has excellent coverage and is very powerful. Fortunately, checking it is not difficult as it is slow and frail.
-Bronzong and Skarmory are the best counter. They can switch into anything Mamo throw at it and threaten it back with Gyro Ball and Toxic Stall. Bronzong need to be aware of repeating Superpower though.
-Bulky support Arceus form not weak to its STAB, such as Normal, Water, Ghost, Fairy and Fighting Arceus, can take a hit and cripple Mamoswine with Wil-O-Wisp or outright KO back with a super effective Judgement.
-Bulky Extreme Killer survive a Superpower and can set up Sword Dance
-Gyarados is immune to Earthquake and can take an Icicle Crash thanks to Intimidate, and hit back with Waterfall. It must watch out for the rare freeze dry and stone edge though
-Xerneas and Kyerum-W can generally take an Earthquake or Icicle Crash plus an Ice Shard, and KO back with a powerful Moonblast or Draco Meteor. They lack reliable recovery though and can be wear down.
-If SR is not up, Physical defensive Ho-oh can survive 2 Icicle Crash and KO back with Sacred Fire. It still has to watch out for the rare Stone Edge though.
-After that, it all comes down to prediction on swithching and revenging. For example, if avoiding Earthquake, Kyogre, Steel Arceus, Reshiram, and faster steel type such as Genesect, Scizor, and Offensive Dialga, can force Mamoswine out with attacks. If avoiding Icicle Crash, faster Groudon with a fire move, Ho-Oh, and Thundurus with Grass Knot can KO back and Lugia can set up reflect and proceed to Stall Mamo out. Anything else faster without a weakness to Ice Shard such as Palkia, Mewtwo, Blaziken, and Terrakion are great revenge killer.
