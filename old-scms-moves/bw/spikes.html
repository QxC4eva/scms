[SHORT DESC]
Causes damage to the enemy whenever they switch.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Deals damage to the foe's grounded Pokemon automatically upon their switching in. Damage dealt depends on the number of layers present (maximum 3). Does 1/8 damage with one layer, 1/6 damage with two layers, and 1/4 damage with three layers, all rounded down. Fails after three layers are present on the target's side of the field. Is removed from foe's side of the field when they use Rapid Spin, or when user's team uses Defog. Not affected by type resistances or weaknesses. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Pokemon with the ability Wonder Guard are not immune. In a double or triple battle, this move will affect all of the foe's Pokemon.</p>

<p>Grounded Pokemon are Pokemon that are not part-Flying-type, do not have Ingrain active, do not have the ability Levitate, do not have Magnet Rise active, and are not holding an Air Balloon. If Gravity is active, all Pokemon are grounded. All Pokemon holding an Iron Ball are grounded.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While slightly inferior to Stealth Rock, Spikes is an excellent entry hazard. The best users of this move are the ones that can stay on the field for an extended amount of time, in particular Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress. Once three layers of Spikes have been set up, any Pokemon that isn't a Flying-type nor has the ability Levitate or Magic Guard is immediately stripped of one fourth of their HP upon switching into the battle. Stealth Rock can even work well with Spikes, with the two hazard's damage stacking up to easily take down opponents. Be careful, though, as setting up Spikes with incorrect timing can be detrimental; the opponent can take advantage of the fact that you're setting up to set up themselves and proceed to sweep your team, or even simply use Rapid Spin to rid your Spikes from the field.</p>
