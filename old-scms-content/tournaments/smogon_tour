<h2>Introduction to the Smogon Tour</h2>

<p>The Smogon Tour is one of the most exciting things about Smogon!</p>

<p>Two tournaments will be held every weekend over a nine-week season. Thirty-two skilled players will join and compete until one triumphant battler is left. For the sixth season of the Smogon Tour, three metagames within the D/P generation will test each battler's skill as he uses ubers, standard, and underused Pok√©mon. One week will be strictly devoted to one metagame; for example, one week will be UU-only, the next will be OU-only, and the following week will be Ubers-only.</p> 

<p>The tours finish within about two hours. The rules are slightly different from regular tournaments, because they are meant to finish all at once. As soon as you sign-up, you battle until you lose. If you don't lose, you keep battling until you win the tour!</p>

<h2>How do I sign up for the Smogon Tour?</h2>

<p>Signing up for the Smogon Tour is very simple. All you need is an account on the Smogon forums and the ability to tell time! A sign up thread for each tournament will be opened in the Smogon Tour sub-forum at the times listed in the schedule. Simply post "in" and hang around until the sign-ups fill. At that time, pairings will be posted and you must begin battling your opponent. Keep in mind that you must be on your forum nick; people under a different alias hold up the host and delay the Tour's progress.</p>
