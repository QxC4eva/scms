[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Motor Drive grants an immunity to all Electric-type moves that target the wielder, including status moves such as <a href="/bw/moves/thunder_wave">Thunder Wave</a>, and gives a one stage boost to Speed when hit by an Electric-type move. If a Pokemon with Motor Drive is at +6 Speed and is targeted by an Electric-type move, it will still be immune to the Electric-type attack but will not receive further Speed boosts. Motor Drive also prevents a held <a href="/bw/items/cell_battery">Cell Battery</a> from working.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The one decent user of Motor Drive is <a href="/bw/pokemon/electivire">Electivire</a>, which was ridiculed last generation for being grossly overrated by new players. In actual fact, Electivire was never really a bad Pokemon, and this generation, with a lot of Electric attacks, specifically <a href="/bw/moves/thunder">Thunder</a>, roaming around due to <a href="/bw/abilities/drizzle">Drizzle</a>, it can be a more than viable option to tackle rain teams, especially thanks to a new STAB move in <a href="/bw/moves/wild_charge">Wild Charge</a>. <a href="/bw/pokemon/zebstrika">Zebstrika</a> is average but really doesn't boast the same qualities that Electivire does.</p>
