<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>It was a cold winter's day... Okay, maybe not. More like a lazy afternoon in #TCG (feel free to stop by, we don't bite). People were gearing up for their Christmas holidays and there was nothing to do. Out of sheer boredom since there was not much to GP check, and I had finished writing Empoleon's update, I figured I might as well mess with my deck a little bit. After adding a Lucario GL and some more Energy, Mekkah turns up. I felt that I might as well test my deck's modifications.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Zy:</strong> <em>"Mekkah, wanna battle?"</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mekkah:</strong> <em>"Yeah, sure."</em><br /><br />
But little did our intrepid card players know that this match would seal their destinies... Or just be an entertaining article, that works too.</p>

<div class="battle">

<div class="turns"><p>Mekkah: Start game for player A.<br />
Mekkah: *** Shuffles deck ***<br />
Mekkah: Draws 7 card(s) from deck.<br />

Mekkah: heads<br />
Zy: *** COIN FLIP *** TAILS (13)<br />
Zy: Flips over a Smeargle (playmat), now faceup.<br />
Mekkah: Flips over a Uxie (playmat), now faceup.</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>I got pretty lucky with my starting hand. Smeargle and Unown Q. Sadly, no other basics can be problematic, especially since I'm not playing Unown Q yet. Going first will be pretty helpful for me, since I can hopefully use Portrait, and he'll have a Pokemon Collector in his hand. Especially helpful seeing as I'm low on supporters and trainers.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>2 Bebe's Searches, a Cynthia's Feelings and an Uxie. Nothing else worth mentioning, so I guess it's Uxie for now. There's a handy Warp Point in case I get a Sableye next turn.</p></div>

<div class="turns"><p>Player B's turn.<br />
Zy: Starts Player B turn 0A:1B<br />
Zy: Draws 1 card(s) from deck.<br />
Zy: Plays Unown Q from hand.<br />
Zy: Unown Q - QUICK<br />
Zy: Attaches a Unown Q to Smeargle<br />
Zy: Smeargle - Portrait<br />
Mekkah: Lets opponent view hand.<br />
Zy: Views opponent's hand.<br />
Zy: Closed the Card List Window.<br />
Zy: Bebe's Search<br />
Zy: Places Bebe's Search (from hand) on top of deck.<br />
Zy: Views deck.<br />
Zy: Moves Luxray GL from deck to temp.<br />
Zy: Closed the Card List Window.<br />
Zy: *** Shuffles deck ***<br />
Zy: Picks up Luxray GL from temp.<br />
Zy: Ends Player B turn 0A:1B</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>Uxie lead gives me nothing about his deck. I spot Cynthia's Feelings, Seeker, 2 Bebe's Searches and a Rescue Energy. This doesn't tell me much, but I'm assuming due to the use of Cynthia and Rescue he's using Gyarados. I would have the advantage, type match-up-wise; however, I'll need to get Lucario GL in play if I'm to stand a chance, since if Gyarados sets up to full power, he can OHKO everything I have. I'll go for Luxray GL first, since my hand is full of Double Colorless and Lightning Energy.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>Obvious Zy is running SP... He's got Luxray GL, and I'm hoping he was silly enough to forget his Lucario. Either way, an Expert Belted Tail Revenge KOes all of his Pokemon.</p></div>

<div class="turns"><p>In between turns.<br />
Player A's turn.<br />
Mekkah: Starts Player A turn 1A:1B<br />
Mekkah: Draws 1 card(s) from deck.<br />
Mekkah: Plays Bebe's Search from hand.<br />
Mekkah: Places card (from hand) on top of deck.<br />

Mekkah: Ends Player A turn 1A:1B</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>The Magikarp confirm it; he's running Gyarados. I'll need to plan on the long run for this if I'm to have a chance. Fortunately, he's only got two Magikarp at the moment, and considering he has to bench one to evolve it, I have a few more turns to set up.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>I need to get a Sableye out if I'm going to win this. Magikarp are of high priority. I'll drop my other Bebe's Search so he can't Portrait it. Warp Energy lets Sableye come out to active, and I use Collector's for 2 Magikarp and an Uxie. Regice is in my prizes, so I'll need Azelf for that.</p></div>

<div class="turns"><p>In between turns.<br />
Player B's turn.<br />
Zy: Starts Player B turn 1A:2B<br />
Zy: Draws 1 card(s) from deck.<br />
Zy: Plays Luxray GL from hand.<br />
Zy: Attaches a Double Colorless Energy to Luxray GL<br />
Zy: Smeargle - Portrait<br />

Zy: Draws 4 card(s) from deck.<br />
Zy: Discards Pokemon Collector (including attachments, if any) from playmat.<br />
Zy: Ends Player B turn 1A:2B</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>I get Luxray GL ready to use Trash Bolt with a DCE. This time I can use the second Bebe's Search in his hand to grab Luxray GL Lv.X, attach a Lightning Energy and be ready to start attacking. Unfortunately, a use of Portrait shows he used his Bebe's Search to drop the other one back into his deck. Clever, clever. I can afford to use Cynthia's Feelings, since if I grab a Cyrus's Conspiracy I can regain that Lightning Energy. Not much else was in my hand, however. And as luck would have it, I grab myself a Lightning Energy, a PokeTurn, Pokemon Collector, and Energy Gain. Collector grabs me an Uxie and a Lucario GL, and I'll pick up a Garchomp C just in case. Play the pair, then use Uxie to draw 4 cards. Perfect draw, I get a Luxray GL Lv.X and there's a Twins, which means I need to let him set up his Gyarados first and KO my Smeargle before I start.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>He Portraits Cynthia's Feelings and it topdecks him a Pokemon Collector. Lucario GL... That's annoying. I'll need to take out his Luxray somehow if I'm to stand a chance of survival.  That's really annoying. However, he still can't do much to me, so I've still got a chance to claw out top.</p></div>

<div class="turns"><p>In between turns.<br />
Player A's turn.<br />
Mekkah: Starts Player A turn 2A:2B<br />
Mekkah: Draws 1 card(s) from deck.<br />
Mekkah: Sorts hand.<br />
Mekkah: Plays Magikarp from hand.<br />
Mekkah: Sableye - Impersonate<br />
Mekkah: Views deck.<br />
Mekkah: Moves Pokemon Collector from deck to discard.<br />
Mekkah: Moves Azelf, Crobat G, Magikarp from deck to hand.<br />
Mekkah: *** Shuffles deck ***<br />
Mekkah: Closed the Card List Window.<br />
Mekkah: Ends Player A turn 2A:2B</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>Azelf means he's likely going to Magikarp in his prizes. This gives me even more time, although the Crobat G he's picked up means that there's a chance he may not even need Expert Belt to take me out.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>I should play Magikarp now since I don't have Broken Time-Space, and if he KOes it then it just goes to my discard and Sableye is still alive, so I'm fine with that. I'll play Azelf next turn for my Regice, and then I should be able to start setting up.</p></div>

<div class="turns"><p>In between turns.<br />
Player B's turn.<br />
Zy: Starts Player B turn 2A:3B<br />
Zy: Draws 1 card(s) from deck.<br />
Zy: Attaches a Lightning Energy to Luxray GL<br />
Zy: Smeargle - Portrait<br />
Mekkah: Lets opponent view hand.<br />
Zy: Views opponent's hand.<br />
Zy: active=B, player=A, Done viewing opponent hand.<br />

Zy: Picks up Uxie (including attachments, if any).<br />
Mekkah: Picks up Uxie (including attachments, if any).<br />
Zy: Plays Ambipom G from hand.<br />
Zy: Retreat Smeargle<br />
Zy: Evolves Luxray GL into Luxray GL Lv.X.<br />
Zy: Luxray GL Lv.X - Bright Look<br />
Zy: Magikarp<br />
Zy: Ends Player B turn 2A:3B</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>Perfect play. I've now got a Luxray GL Lv.X ready to use Trash Bolt, with spare Energy in my hand. Unfortunately, as much as I want to KO his Magikarp and get a prize, that will stop me from using Twins. Plus it just throws that Magikarp into his discard pile, which makes his Gyarados even stronger when he does eventually play it. I've lured it out, which is good enough. Especially since he's unlikely to KO me next turn, so if he evolves it, then it's primed for the kill.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>He hasn't KOed my Magikarp, which is extremely helpful. I should now be able to set up, although the fact that he now has a Luxray GL Lv.X ready to use Trash Bolt and KO me means I need an Expert Belt, and fast.</p></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_regice.png" alt="" /></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>Fortunately, his Gyarados is only running off 2 Magikarps not 3, meaning that he's only doing 60 damage. However, my fears of Crobat G were founded, and he's managed to take out Ambipom G. The moment he attached Rescue Energy, Ambipom became worthless anyway. I bring out Smeargle and get ready for Twins.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>Well, I managed to KO something, at least. I've only got two Magikarps in the discard, so I need to pick up another one from somewhere. Either way, I have the lead right now, but he's probably going to come back with a revenge KO. Fortunately, I've got Rescue Energy and Broken Time-Space is now in play.</p></div>

Zy: Ends Player B turn 3A:4B</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>Twins gets me a Cyrus, which is what I need, and a spare Power Spray in case he tries Crobat G to get my Luxray down to KO range. Annoyingly, his hand doesn't have much either. There's not much I can do, so Seeker will at least lighten up his bench. I get Luxray to even out the score.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>I thought he'd try something like that. However, the Power Spray in his hand is annoying, since I now need to rely on an Expert Belt rather than Crobat G to take him out.</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>That was too close for comfort. He was nearly able to take out my Luxray, and considering I don't have a spare in my hand, that could have been disastrous. Fortunately, he takes out Smeargle, which is now useless in the later stages of the game. He has his own Smeargle, which can abuse my Cyrus to get his PokeTurns, but this is less annoying, since I can just grab Power Sprays to stop him from doing that. Very fortunate that I grabed one with Twins in the meantime, since my Luxray would've been toast.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>Well, Portrait can use his Cyrus's Conspiracy, and that allows me to get a PokeTurn to use on Crobat. With two Flash Bites, I can KO it now that I have 3 Karps in the discard. However, Zy seems to have other plans and plays his Power Spray. Regardless, he's now 10 damage up, and so I can use Seeker next turn for a KO.</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>I don't want to risk using Luxray again in case he can recover and revenge KO me. I take this turn to get ready for a second Luxray. Burning through cards like Energy Exchanger and such allows me to Set Up for as much as I can, which fortunately cumulates in a Premier Ball. His Regice isn't a key player anymore, since he's not discarding any more Karps, but it's still a sitting target. I could slam Uxie instead, and that's where I misplayed. Regardless, I Crobat and Rush his Regice for a prize, and the score levels out again.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>He's taken out Regice, but that's not important anymore, since I already have max power Gyarados. The fact that Smeargle and Uxie are still alive, I'm grateful for, but at this point, it doesn't look good. I'm going to need a miracle or two to claw back a victory.</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>Annoyingly I had no Power Sprays in my hand, so Garchomp was going to die. I was expecting something to go down this turn anyway, and Garchomp wasn't really that needed anymore. In any instance, I should get ready to bring out Luxray for another KO.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>He's got another Cyrus's Conspiracy, so that's another PokeTurn for me. He's got no Power Sprays either, meaning I can whack off his Garchomp. It's not as good a prize as Luxray, but it'll do. Cynthia's Feelings also comes in handy. I'll hold off until he brings out Luxray before I Expert Belt him.</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>The problem with Trash Bolt is that it's a pricey attack. I only have so many Energy in this deck, so hopefully I can find an opening where he doesn't grab a prize, putting me in the lead. The same sequence happens again; Cyrus grabs me an Energy, and I discard it for Trash Bolt which picks me up a prize.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>I've got a Combee, so it's no problem. The problem is he's now got a second Luxray, meaning even if I kill the first one, it'll be in vain.</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>I'm quite glad for Warp Point, since again, it saves my Luxray from harm. Regardless, I have a second Luxray benched and ready to Level Up, but the longer I keep this one alive the better. From this point, it looks like it's just a continuous race of prize exchanging. However, at this rate, he's going to win, so I need to find an opening.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>Warp Point lures out a new target, but it doesn't help, since even though I'm in the lead, I won't keep it for long. I can't KO Luxray, and it would be ridiculous to try, so the most I can do is just whack his Uxie in case he's got the Lv.X in his hand.</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>He's still got Smeargle, so I'm not grabbing any more Cyrus's Conspiracy. I've run out of Basic Energy, but there's still enough left in my hand for 3 more Trash Bolts. Once again, it's a prize exchange, except this time, he's used his Combee and there's no Rescue Energy. Hopefully this is the opportunity I needed to gain the lead while he's recovering. Of course, like any well-played Gyarados, he's going to have a Pokemon Rescue in his hand, and he's going to play it.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>He's stopped picking up Cyrus's Conspiracies, but I'm out of PokeTurns anyway. He grabs an Interviewer which gives me a chance to grab a Rescue Energy.</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>I thought so. However, this is the opportunity I needed - he hasn't picked up a Prize this turn, meaning I can go for the KO and pick up the lead. I'm a bit disappointed at how damaged Luxray is, but it isn't a KO, so I'm pleased with that. Unfortunately, I went for Interviewer's Questions rather than Cyrus's Conspiracy to stop him using PokeTurns, but even that gave him the Rescue Energy he needed.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>Rescue Energy indeed. Unfortunately, I can't Crobat G him enough to knock him out, so I can only just do damage and hope I can knock it out next turn. Of course, he's likely to have a PokeTurn, and he's going to just KO me with the fresh Luxray.</p></div>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>I'm now running dangerously low on Energy. Fortunately, Interviewer's Questions gives me a DCE, which I can use to take him out for now. There's a Warp Energy in my hand, but I never know when I will need it. However, I am on my last prize, so I should be able to win next turn, since he's on two prizes. I think this game is over, and it's over in my favour.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>I can't hold out for much longer - I've now lost the lead in terms of the prize exchange. I'm glad I had Rescue Energy, but it makes little difference. The most I can do now is make this a 1-0 defeat instead of a 2-0 defeat.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>An Expert Belt seals my fate. It KOes his Luxray, but he has a second one, so it makes no difference at all.</p></div>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<div class="speaker zy"><img src="/media/smog/14/tcgbattle_zy.png" alt="Zy" /><p>The ending was completely anticlimactic. The moment he failed to KO Luxray, I could take the lead, it was all downhill from there. The beginning of the match was good though, since while I got to set up first, he pulled a fast one on me and set up faster than I had anticipated, meaning I had to cut short my second set up and start attacking, which invariably put me behind for most of the match. Of course, he technically had the deck advantage - SP's can't do much against Gyarados unless we're carrying Lucario like I was, and even then, we can't OHKO an Expert Belted Gyarados without Crobat (lucky for me), while he can OHKO everything we have (Garchomp C Lv.X and Luxray GL Lv.X both reach 110 HP without Expert Belt). Of course, it was interesting to see how he was able to continuously recover and smash my Pokemon back, but in the end, the fact that my Luxray were still alive allowed me to keep coming back.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mekkah"><img src="/media/smog/interview_mekkah.jpg" alt="Mekkah" /><p>I had a pretty bad start early on, but I was able to rock up pretty easily and gain an early-game lead. I don't know why he was faffing around instead of going in for the KO, but it gave me time to set up. However, throughout the whole match I barely had what I needed, and was only able to just recover and strike back. Of course, eventually that petered out, and I ran out of power, letting him pick up the lead when I could no longer KO his Pokemon. Technically, he had the advantage in terms of type match-up, especially since he carried Lucario GL, although I should have been able to take his Luxray out before he could set a second one up. If I could, then I may have been able to win that, but then again, Aaron's Collection was probably lurking in his hand at some point. I may have been constantly struggling to stay in control, and I eventually lost that battle towards the end, but I think I played well considering I was at a loss in terms of decks and draw power early on.</p></div>

</div>

<h2>Top Plays and Misplays</h2>

<h3>Top Plays:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Me, for topdecking a Crobat and an Energy just in time to win the game.</li>
<li>Mekkah, for being able to constantly recover and keep Tail Revenging.</li>
<li>Lucario GL for being there. Couldn't have won otherwise.</li>
<li>Team Galactic's Invention TGI-105 PokeTurn. Mekkah's Crobats would've won him the game if I didn't have any Power Sprays.</li>
<li>Smeargle is a pretty cool guy. He steals Zy's Cyrus's Conspiracies and doesn't afraid of Garchomp's Dragon Rush.</li>
<li>Cynthia's Feelings - magical topdecks for the pair of us.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Misplays:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Me, for not smashing his Smeargle or Uxie with Dragon Rush earlier on, which would have saved me a great deal of headache.</li>
<li>Me, for not catching on to his Smeargle and continuously grabbing Cyrus's Conspiracies until it was too late.</li>
<li>Me, for not being more careful with my Energy placement - if I didn't topdeck that last Warp Energy, it could have gone the other way.</li>
<li>Mekkah, for Seekering that Regice when he could've grabbed Crobat G instead, potentially winning him the game as he could've dropped 10 on Luxray or something.</li>
</ul>
