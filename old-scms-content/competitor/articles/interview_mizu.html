  After chatting on the phone, Mizuhime and I agreed to meet up for an interview this evening inside the Food Court at the local mall. On my way there, I began to wonder why I had her name as Water Princess on my phone... Anyway, I ended up being 5 minutes late. How unprofessional of me... I glanced toward the Doubles Queen herself sitting at a nearby table as soon as I walked into the Food Court. We went ahead and traded hellos as I sat on the opposite seat and began.

  <p>
  First off, did you ever expect to get this far?
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker mizuhime">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_mizuhime.png" alt="Mizuhime" />
  <p>
  Well, I wasn't originally even in the open I was just a sub. This actually really upset me because my goal was to win the entire thing, but as we can both see, that plan fell just a little short.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="aside">
  <p>
  You don't really see subs making it to the finals all that often. Certainly a great feat. But then again, this is Mizuhime.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker ggamer745">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_ggamer.png" alt="GGamer745" />
  <p>
  Ah, I see. It seems you did pretty well, though, considering you reached the finals!
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker mizuhime">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_mizuhime.png" alt="Mizuhime" />
  <p>
  Can't complain too much about the results; if I had to lose I'm glad it was to TFC. He's been one of my friends for a long time on Smogon, and I know he's a very good Doubles player.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="aside">
  <p>
  It was bound to be an intense series. I made a mental note to watch the replays for some possible inspiration.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker ggamer745">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_ggamer.png" alt="GGamer745" />
  <p>
  Alright, interesting. So , how did you prepare for each round?
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker mizuhime">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_mizuhime.png" alt="Mizuhime" />
  <p>
  Well, I didn't really prepare for my matches. I only prepared for my set against TFC because I had a general idea of what he would bring. Every other round, I used the exact same teams that are all like 4 or 5 months old by this point.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker ggamer745">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_ggamer.png" alt="GGamer745" />
  <p>
  Considering you reached finals it must've been quite surprising for you, no?
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker mizuhime">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_mizuhime.png" alt="Mizuhime" />
  <p>
  Because of my lack of preparation?
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="aside">
  <p>
  I simply nodded. Intriguing indeed.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker mizuhime">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_mizuhime.png" alt="Mizuhime" />
  <p>
  Well, yes and no; yes because I was too lazy to build teams, no because I got a few "singles" players in the later rounds that didn't know what my Pokemon would do, as my teams aren't exactly the definition of standard. That and Choice Specs Sylveon + Mega Kangaskhan is really good.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="aside">
  <p>
  I simply nodded at her response. For some reason, I felt my stomach rumble a bit. Not that it affected the conversation, but... Dang, I was so hungry!
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker ggamer745">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_ggamer.png" alt="GGamer745" />
  <p>
  I see. I was just about to ask what sets or teams did you well, haha.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker mizuhime">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_mizuhime.png" alt="Mizuhime" />
  <p>
  My most known team and the team I shared with all of my friends who asked me for one, Mega Kangaskhan, Choice Specs Sylveon, Choice Band Gyarados, Bulky Thundurus, Substitute Heatran, and Haban Berry Hydreigon.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="aside">
  <p>
  Suddenly a ringtone could be heard, apparently coming from Mizuhime.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker mizuhime">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_mizuhime.png" alt="Mizuhime" />
  <p>
  Mind if I take this for like 20 minutes? I'll be back in a bit.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker ggamer745">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_ggamer.png" alt="GGamer745" />
  <p>
  Ah, alright.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="aside">
  <p>
  I patiently awaited her to finish. In the meantime I began glancing over Subway's menu. I hoped I had enough money for a footlong.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker mizuhime">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_mizuhime.png" alt="Mizuhime" />
  <p>
  Back, real sorry about that. Shall we continue?
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker ggamer745">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_ggamer.png" alt="GGamer745" />
  <p>
  Alright.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="aside">
  <p>
  I quickly regained focus and glanced over my notepad. It seems I only had a single question left to ask, haha.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker ggamer745">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_ggamer.png" alt="GGamer745" />
  <p>
  The team seems pretty solid. Lastly, what would've been on your mind if you had managed to beat TFC?
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker mizuhime">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_mizuhime.png" alt="Mizuhime" />
  <p>
  Well, I'm not exactly sure. Probably that I had actually pulled off the 3/3 dream for IDM, 3/3 being winning 3 out of the 3 finished opens thus far. Probably would have been really happy, but I wasn't even upset that I lost really, I was just happy for having a good set.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="aside">
  <p>
  An answer I'd expect from the Doubles Queen herself. Or, Water Princess... Argh, whatever. I went ahead and gave a smile.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker ggamer745">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_ggamer.png" alt="GGamer745" />
  <p>
  That's great to hear. Alright, so anything else you'd like to add before we wrap this up?
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaker mizuhime">
  <img src="/competitor/interview_mizuhime.png" alt="Mizuhime" />
  <p>
  I would like to say thank you to Bloo and Hugo for helping me prepare for finals; they aren't known as Doubles players, but both of them are very good at anything they do. I would also like to thank anyone who was pulling for me to win in the end, you're all awesome :]
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="aside">
  <p>
  I went ahead and thanked her for agreeing to do this interview, stood up from my seat, ready to take my leave. This being my first interview, it was quite the thrill! Though I feel as if I forgot something... Ah, to congratulate her on reaching the finals. A little embarrassing, but I can't look back now. Time for a sandwich.
