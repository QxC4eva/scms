Overview
########

With its great Fire / Steel typing and good bulk, Heatran is one of the best checks to top threats such as Talonflame, Aegislash, and Clefable, as well as a superb switch-in to the ever-popular Fairy-types. Heatran also has solid offensive potential with its stellar base 130 Special Attack stat. However, its base 77 Speed often lets it down, and its typing also leaves it weak to common Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks. Unfortunately, Heatran doesn't have any form of reliable recovery, meaning it can be worn down rather easily. However, play to Heatran's strong points, and you won't be disappointed.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Lava Plume
move 2: Protect
move 3: Taunt / Roar / Stealth Rock
move 4: Toxic / Will-O-Wisp
ability: Flash Fire
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 220 SpD / 40 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========

This is the standard Heatran that you'll see on most teams. Lava Plume is a solid, consistent STAB attack that comes with a 30% chance to burn. Protect allows Heatran to gains crucial Leftovers recovery, scout the opponent's moves, and rack up Toxic damage. Taunt is a very interesting option for Heatran, as it really helps against more defensive teams and stops Pokemon like Bulk Up Talonflame from setting up on Heatran if you choose to run Will-O-Wisp. It also cripples walls like Clefable, Mandibuzz, Chansey, and Blissey. Finally, Toxic is the best choice for the last moveslot for its ability to nail bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Manaphy, and Azumarill on the switch.

Apart from these moves, Heatran has a few other options which are perfectly viable. Will-O-Wisp can be used to deal with Mega Mawile a lot easier and soften physical attacks aimed at Heatran in general; it also cripples common switch-ins to Heatran like Terrakion and Garchomp. Roar is an option to rack up entry hazard damage; it also allows you to phaze certain threats like Swords Dance Mega Mawile and Bulk Up Talonflame. Finally, Stealth Rock can be used on Heatran if you can't find room anywhere else on your team, as Heatran has a good match-up against most Defoggers, such as Latios, Zapdos, and Mandibuzz.

Set Details
========

Leftovers is the item of choice, as it's great for healing off residual damage. 248 HP EVs are used to minimize entry hazard damage, while 40 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Mega Mawile. The rest is put in Special Defense for additional special bulk. A Calm nature is used to further boost Heatran's Special Defense.

Usage Tips
========

This set is generally suited for defensive and balanced teams. Heatran can easily tank weak Water-type attacks from bulky Water-types, so even if you can't predict their switch-in, it might be best to Toxic them regardless (as with the combination of Protect and Roar, Heatran can easily gain back health via Leftovers). Be careful when using Protect, as it can often be used as setup fodder for sweepers like Garchomp and Terrakion. Heatran can phaze Dragon Dance users, but it shouldn't be your main check, as it still does take quite a lot from boosted Outrages and it's often hit for super effective damage by common coverage moves.

Team Options
========

Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, Gourgiest-S, and Amoonguss are incredible partners for Heatran due to their great synergy and ability to deal with Ground- and Water-type attacks. Bulky Water-types are also very good partners, with Rotom-W, Quagsire, and Keldeo being optimal choices. Having a solid physical wall to take on Garchomp and Terrakion is generally a good option since they often force Heatran out. This makes Gliscor, Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon all good teammates. Clefable is a great partner for Heatran, as it can easily take Fighting-type attacks and also provide Wish support, while Heatran easily takes on the Steel-types that annoy Clefable.

SubToxic
########
name: SubToxic
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Lava Plume / Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 4: Protect / Earth Power
ability: Flash Fire
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 SpA / 12 SpD / 244 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
======

Substitute is the main move of this set, as Heatran's great defensive typing allows it to force switches and easily set up a Substitute. With a Substitute up, Heatran can safely Toxic threats that switch in to take it out. Lava Plume is the preferred STAB for this set, as it's accurate, has a helpful 30% chance to burn the target, and can take out Steel-types that are immune to Toxic. Fire Blast can also be used for more power, though it isn't accurate and doesn't burn as often. Flamethrower is another STAB option for this set, as it's accurate and moderately powerful, though it's not as powerful as Fire Blast and doesn't have the burn chance Lava Plume does. Protect is used in the last slot to stall with Toxic damage as well as gain Leftovers recovery. Earth Power is another option instead of Protect, as it allows Heatran to take out Pokemon that can take Fire-type moves, such as Tyranitar and opposing Heatran.

Set Details
=========

Leftovers are the item of choice, as it allows Heatran to heal off HP lost from using Substitute and residual damage. Flash Fire is a really helpful ability, as it allows Heatran to switch into Fire-type attacks with ease and receive a boost to its Fire-type attacks. The EV spread with a Timid nature allows Heatran to outspeed Adamant Excadrill while giving it some extra special bulk.

Usage Tips
==========

The main strategy for this set is as follows: switch into a Pokemon that Heatran can take on easily with its great defensive typing, such as Clefable or Talonflame, set up a Substitute as your opponent switches out; and then use Toxic, Flamethrower, or Earth Power depending on what your opponent brings in. Toxic should be the move Heatran uses the most, as it's great for slowly wearing the opponent down for the rest of the match. If your opponent is immune to Toxic, Flamethrower or Earth Power should be used for good damage.

Team Options
============

Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Gourgeist-S make good partners, as they can easily take the Water- and Ground-type attacks Heatran hates. They can also help wear the opponent down with Leech Seed, Spikes, Iron Barbs, and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Bulky Flying-types such as Skarmory, Gliscor, and Landorus-T are great partners, as they are immune to Ground-type attacks and can easily take a Fighting-type attack. Water-types such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Azumarill can take on the Fire- and Rock-types that resist Heatran's main STAB. Fairy-types, such as Clefable and Sylveon, are also helpful, as they can tank Fighting-type attacks while Heatran can wall the Fire-types they hate. They can also provide Wish support to make up for Heatran's lack of reliable recovery.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Overheat / Fire Blast
move 2: Flash Cannon
move 3: Stone Edge / Earth Power
move 4: Flamethrower / Fire Blast / Hidden Power Ice
ability: Flash Fire
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Overheat is the main STAB option because of its high Base Power, since Choice Scarf Heatran needs as much power as possible. Fire Blast is a more consistent STAB, however, for its ability to clean up late-game. Flash Cannon is a secondary STAB that hits Fairy- and Rock-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Stone Edge allows Heatran to revenge kill key threats such as Volcarona, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard Y. Earth Power offers nice coverage in general and allows Heatran to nail opposing Fire-types like Heatran and Infernape. Flamethrower is an option for a weaker, yet more reliable STAB option. Fire Blast can be used here as well if you're not already using it in the first moveslot. Finally, Hidden Power Ice is an option for more coverage, allowing Heatran to hit Dragon-types for nice damage, although its main use is just to revenge kill Landorus-T and Gliscor.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is used to maximize power and Speed, allowing Heatran to outspeed Greninja. Modest is the nature of choice for this set, since it needs as much power as possible to clean up late-game. Choice Scarf Heatran is more suited to cleaning up late game, while also revenge killing a few threats. Missing out on outspeeding a few Pokemon such as Weavile and Talonflame can prove to be costly, which is why Timid shouldn't be completely neglected as an option, but the extra power is generally more useful than the extra Speed; in any case, Choice Scarf Heatran is best used as a late-game cleaner, meaning it prefers having extra power.

Usage Tips
========

This set is aimed more towards balanced teams, where it can make good use of its surprise factor to check normally faster threats while acting as a 'glue' in general. Try to keep Heatran around as a late-game cleaner, as that's where it's best used. Choice Scarf Heatran can also revenge kill threatening Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, Scizor, Aegislash, and Excadrill. Choice Scarf Heatran is also quite rare, meaning it can easily catch the opponent off-guard.

Team Options
========

Rotom-W is probably the best partner for Heatran, as it is immune to Ground-type attacks and can fire back with its Water-type STAB. More offensive Water-types, such as Keldeo, can wallbreak and make it easier for Heatran to clean late-game. Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Gourgeist-S are also great partners, since they can comfortably tank Water-type attacks. Flying-types such as Skarmory, Gliscor, and Landorus-T make good partners, as they are immune to Ground-type attacks and can tank a Fighting-type attack with relative ease. Fairy-types like Clefable and Sylveon also make good partners, as Heatran can wall the Fire-types they hate, while they can take Fighting-type attacks for Heatran in return.

Other Options
########

Heatran has a few options that aren't listed in the main sets. An offensive set with Air Balloon can be used to allow Heatran to check most Ground-types nicely, but it's checked easily. A Choice Specs set can be used for extreme power, but it's easily walled by Chansey and is outclassed by Mega Charizard Y as a Fire-type wallbreaker. A Sunny Day set with Magma Storm is a possibility, but weather teams aren't nearly as common as they used to be, making this set less effective. Torment is a cool option to use on Heatran to annoy switch-ins that have only one coverage move to hit it with, but generally the first defensive set fits onto teams more easily. Power Herb Solar Beam is a neat idea to nail Water-types for solid damage, but it can only be used once per game.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: Chansey and Blissey can take anything Heatran throws at them due to their immense special bulk. Natural Cure and Heal Bell mean they don't mind taking a Toxic either.

**Ground-type**: Ground-types such as Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T can easily OHKO Heatran with a STAB Earthquake. However, they all hate Will-O-Wisp, Toxic cripples Landorus-T, and Fire Blast can do a hefty chunk of damage to the latter two. Choice Scarf sets can also run Hidden Power Ice to hit them super effectively.

**Water-types**: Bulky Water-types are great switch-ins to most sets, but they must be wary of Toxic. Rotom-W, Keldeo, Manaphy, and Politoed are all common Water-types. Starmie gets a special mention for its ability to spin away Stealth Rock and has access to Natural Cure.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types like Tyranitar and Terrakion can check Heatran nicely, but they must be wary of Flash Cannon. With sand up, their Special Defense is also increased by 50%, allowing them to easily tank a hit or two if need be.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types like Keldeo and Conkeldurr can easily take a hit and force Heatran out with their STAB attacks. Conkeldurr can also take advantage of Toxic with Guts.

**Dugtrio**: Dugtrio can easily revenge kill Heatran thanks to its ability, Arena Trap, and its access to STAB Earthquake.
