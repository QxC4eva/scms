<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a boy who was just starting up on Smogon and wanted Tiering Contributor. At that same time, there was a tier with only about 2 days left until the deadline to obtain a seat on the council by getting #1 on the ladder or through other means. This boy had a friend from long ago...you may know of him as the man who infamously blamed a child for the death of someone close to him...or as the master of LC...or the guy who defeated Bloo in a tournament with a Swagger Aron...yes my friends, this is the legendary, permabanned user, D4RR3N. He was very cocky, and challenged me to get voting requirements in a tier I had never played before. After trying out some awful teams on the ladder, I was matched up with a user called 'easy beat'. He was running a core of Snover, Solosis, and Duosion, and almost won...but he was an awful player (he was from PO...like come on) so I won anyway. However, this core fascinated me a lot, and so, I built a team around it and changed 3 of the Pokemon on his team to my liking. The team managed to peak #1 on the RU ladder in just a matter of hours, allowing me, who had absolutely no idea what was going on in RU, to vote on the legendary Porygon-Z, which stayed unbanned with a 4-3 vote (I thought Porygon-Z sucked because I had no knowledge of the metagame :] ). Dubbed by Texas Cloverleaf as 'endtrails', this team became a legendary team in the RU community, and was the defining team of Round 3. The metagame has changed a lot, however, and so, if you so please, you can help modify this team in order to adapt to the current metagame...and then maybe, just maybe...you too can become number 1 on the highly prestigious Pokemon Showdown Ladder!</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Snover</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Snow Warning<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 252 SpA / 4 Spe<br />
Mild Nature<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br /
- Blizzard<br />
- Wood Hammer<br />
- Ice Shard</p>

<p>It's a hail team. What did you expect? Focus Sash Snover is a solid lead in the metagame, and worked even better in Round 3. It has surprisingly good coverage, and can hit relatively hard with its STAB Blizzard and Wood Hammer. Ice Shard lets it finish off weakened foes, while Hidden Power Fire lets it destroy Steel-types, such as Escavalier and Ferroseed. The EVs give it as much attacking power as possible, as Speed isn't too much of an issue with Focus Sash. And of course, Snover sets up hail, the entire premise of the team. Snover guarantees that I can get solid damage off early in the game, setting up my team to smash niggas later on.</p>

<p><strong>Duosion</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Magic Guard<br />
EVs: 252 SpA<br />
IVs: 0 Spe
Quiet Nature<br />
- Trick Room<br />
- Endeavor<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Toxic</p>

<p>One of the members of my strong Endeavor core. Trick Room + Endeavor + Magic Guard is extremely good in hail, setting up my team for later while also annihilating any Pokemon that isn't Ice-type or has an ability such as Overcoat. Shadow Ball is very useful, as it hits most Ghost-types hard, as Duosion has extremely high Special Attack (it's as much as Reuniclus, gggggg) Psychic isn't necessary since Endeavor in hail kills everything Psychic would anyway. Toxic lets Duosion mess up walls, and also lets it hit any Spiritomb attempting to switch in. Focus Sash guarantees that it can live any hit, and no EVs are put into defenses or HP in order to make it so that Duosion can get to 1 HP more easily. Magic Guard ensures that its Focus Sash will never be lost until it gets hit.</p>

<p><strong>Solosis</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Magic Guard<br />
Level: 1<br />
IVs: 0 Spe
Quiet Nature<br />
- Trick Room<br />
- Endeavor<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Confuse Ray</p>

<p>The champion himself. I mean, who honestly could resist smashing people with a Level 1 blob that looks like a deformed embryo? This thing is more epic than Riolu, CB Ninjask, and Scarf Probopass combined (well, maybe not). After Duosion hits Ghost-types, Solosis can set up Trick Room again and get almost a guaranteed KO. At Level 1, any hit will bring out down to 1 HP, giving it an easy way to finish off the opposition. Toxic lets it cripple walls that it cannot defeat with Endeavor (ie: Mandibuzz), while Confuse Ray is a filler that can come in handy in situations against Pokemon such as Clefable. Solosis is very good at setting up Trick Room, and had a large amount of surprise factor (as did Duosion) during Round 3. It perfectly sets up my sweeper for later.</p>

<p><strong>Lampent</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD<br />
IVs: 0 Spe<br />
Quiet Nature<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Trick Room<br />
- Memento</p>

<p>My third Trick Room Pokemon. Lampent was selected because it was immune to Fire, stopping Pokemon such as Entei from just spamming Flare Blitz. Unlike my other 2 Trick Room Pokemon, Lampent is focused on hitting hard with its Life Orb-boosted STAB Fire Blast and STAB Shadow Ball. Memento is a solid option in the 4th slot that lets it "suicide" when I need it to die in order to bring out my sweeper. It's also useful in that it can let my sweeper live more hits from that specific Pokemon if it needs to, and it is very useful for late-game situations. It essentially works like Explosion, replacing the damage with stat lowering. Lampent hits very hard, especially after a Flash Fire boost. It's also very slow, meaning it can outrun most of the tier under Trick Room. However, it is pretty weak, and really isn't that good (think Double01) and so, it should probably be replaced.</p>

<p><strong>Druddigon</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Rough Skin<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def<br />
IVs: 0 Spe<br />
Brave Nature<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Fire Punch</p>

<p>THE SWEEPER. Druddigon has been a beast for ages, from Round 3 up until now. CB Outrage off of its massive Attack stat OHKOs everything that doesn't resist it, and even those that do usually get 2HKOd. Sucker punch is solid priority that can finish off a weakened foe if Trick Room isn't up. EQ and Fire Punch provide coverage, but Outrage is key move on this team. Trick Room is up almost all of the time, allowing Druddigon to transform his middling Speed into a true advantage, wrecking teams like a Lanturn vs. Lavos Spawn. Fire Punch is very solid though, as it can decimate Escavalier on the switch. A Life Orb may be a better option for this Druddigon, as it can feign Choice Band with Fire Punch and then decimate with Outrage. However, no matter the item, it is a true champion, and completely annihilates offensive teams by itself. Even with a head that looks worse than Eli Manning's infamous disappointment face, he wins rings just like him.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-F</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Volt Switch<br />
- Trick</p>

<p>The Speedy Pokemon on this team. FROSTBITE does actually what his name suggests: he smashes niggas noobs so hard that they get chills and run away. Blizzard hits insanely hard, and not many Pokemon in the tier can tank it. Thunderbolt lets Rotom-F hit Water-types, while Votl Switch provides some much-needed momentum. Trick is always a solid option, messing up noobs who think they can defeat me with Smeargle. A Choice Scarf user on a Trick Room team may seem weird, but just in case Trick Room isn't up, it allows my team to still be competitive. It's also very good early game, and is superb at messing up walls to help Druddigon for later. It's weakness to Stealth Rock may seem like an issue considering I have no Rapid Spinner, but I usually don't need to switch it in too often anyway. a Timid Nature guarantees that it outruns as many things as possible.</p>
