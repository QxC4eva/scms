[SHORT DESC]
Lowers target's Attack by 1 stage.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Attack by one stage. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune. Pokemon with the abilities Clear Body or Hyper Cutter are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Growl is never used competitively, as it requires a moveslot and an attacking turn to take effect which can be troublesome to find. If you theoretically find a free turn, note that the stat is not lowered fast enough to actually be worth using. If for some reason you need to lower the opponent's Attack, there are more reliable moves that do the same job. Alternatively, you can also use a Pokemon with the Intimidate ability.</p>
