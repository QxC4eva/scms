Meowstic
########

With seven other Prankster Pokemon available, Meowstic has its work cut out for it to stand out for a spot most teams. However, Meowstic's support movepool is a significant mark in its favor, as it features very important moves such as Safeguard, Light Screen, Reflect, and Thunder Wave. On top this, Meowstic has access to Fake Out, which can buy a free turn on the first turn it is in the battle. Meowstic also has a good Speed stat, which can allow it to naturally outspeed other support and bulky Pokemon without needing investment.

Meowstic is odd in that it only has access to Prankster as its ability if it is male. Its pure Psychic type isn't a good defensive typing, especially with Tyranitar and Aegislash being very common. Meowstic is often forced to run an offensive move to prevent it being complete Taunt bait, and this is unfortunate as Meowstic has a mediocre Special Attack stat and will be unable to deal very much damage to anything. Even with Prankster and its great support movepool, Meowstic often finds itself outclassed by other support Pokemon, as they have bulk and handle common threats more reliably.

Moves
========

Given the presence of Will-O-Wisp, Safeguard helps protect your physical attackers from burns. It can also be used to buff your own physical attackers as it also blocks self-inflicted status, meaning that Meowstic can use Swagger against its partner and give a +2 Attack boost without confusing them, even if they do not carry a Lum or Persim Berry. Swagger also gives Meowstic a way away to confuse opposing Special Attackers and only give them a 48.5% percent chance including accuracy to successfully pull off their desired attack. The third moveslot can be used for Thunder Wave, which, in tandem with confusion, further limits opposing attack chance down to one turn out of every eight, and also halves its target's Speed stat, allowing potentially slower Pokemon to move before them. Dual Screens could be run decreasing the amount of damage taken by Meowstic and its partner, but running either Light Screen or Reflect separately is plausible as well in order to cover a weaker defense. Charm can be used to halve the physical attack of opposing Pokemon and can be used multiple times, decreasing incoming damage by a lot more than Reflect would. However, unlike Reflect, the opponent can switch out their Pokemon to reset its Attack stat, so the effect is not lasting. Psychic gives Meowstic an attacking option if it fears Taunt. However, it doesn't hit particularly hard. Fake Out could also be run on the fourth moveslot to get a free first turn and ease predictions as well.

Set Details
========

The EV spread with a Bold nature is run to survive a Return from Mega Kangaskhan or a sun-boosted Heat Wave from Mega Charizard Y. However, you can run more bulk on either side, depending on the rest of the team. Sitrus Berry is Meowstic's primary item as it often turns 2HKOs into 3HKOs. Mental Herb should only be used if Meowstic fears Taunt and Encore. This allows Meowstic to use another support move on the next turn.

Usage Tips
========

As a support Pokemon, Meowstic is intrinsically useful at all points of the game, and should be used to disrupt the opposing team in order to support your own. That said, there will be points where a more offensive approach is needed, and in those situations, knowing when to switch out is important. As Meowstic has little or no offensive presence, it is never advisable to run Meowstic alongside any other support Pokemon as you will only be able to deal very little direct damage against your opponent's side, all while also acting as potential setup bait.

Team Options
========

Physical attackers such as Mega Mawile, Mega Kangaskhan, and faster Pokemon like such as Aerodactyl hugely benefit from Meowstic's support. Safeguard and Swagger support together turn these already powerful threats into absolute monsters, allowing them to achieve multiple OHKOs all without fearing status such as burn and sleep. Fighting- and Dark-types also help take care of many of the Pokemon that threaten Meowstic. Such as Scrafty, Mienshao, and Tyranitar.

Other Options
########

Meowstic gets Quick Guard, which can be used to block priority moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and an opposing Meowstic's support moves. Similarly, Protect can be run to scout out a move or let Meowstic's partner deal with a threats. However, this will be at a cost of a moveslot which would otherwise be used for support, and, unlike Quick Guard, it only protects Meowstic. Leftovers can be used if Sitrus Berry is already used elsewhere on the team. However, it won't often prevent 2HKOs, making Mental Herb a generally better item. Confide can be used to lower an opposing Pokemon's Special Attack stat by one stage, potentially multiple times. Its effects even go through Protect. Despite this, it is still largely outclassed by Light Screen, as Light Screen halves the special damage done against your entire team rather than lowering the special damage output of only one of your opponent's Pokemon by just one stage. Rain Dance can be used to remove Mega Charizard Y's sun and Tyranitar's sand and also to support Pokemon like Ludicolo that aren't dependent on rain but still appreciate its presence. Equally, Sunny Day can be used to set up sun and simultaneously take down rain and sand. Meowstic can use Trick Room to reverse attack order and then continue to support its team from there. Trick, when used alongside a Lagging Tail or a Choice item, can be used to disrupt opposing strategies by forcing opponents to move last or get locked into a single move.

Checks & Counters
########

**Strong Super Effective Moves**: Strong attackers that can hit Meowstic with super effective moves that do more than 62.5% damage can 2HKO even through Sitrus Berry. The two which stand out the most are Aegislash and Tyranitar.

**Taunt**: Taunt completely shuts down Meowstic, forcing it to only use Psychic, which won't deal very much damage.

**Encore**: Encore locks Meowstic into the same move it used last, potentially making it unable to support its team properly, if at all.

**Quick Guard**: As Quick Guard now blocks Prankster moves, it can be used to block Meowstic's support moves. Talonflame is the most notable user of Quick Guard.

**Safeguard**: Safeguard prevents Meowstic from using Thunder Wave and Swagger against the opposing team, stopping it from fulfilling its primary role.
