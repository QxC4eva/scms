Overview
########
- Dragon / Rock unique typing. 
- High attack, decent bulk. 

Stealth Rock 
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Dragon Tail
move 3: Fire Fang / Brick Break 
move 4: Stone Edge / Rock Tomb
ability: Strong Jaw
item: Berry Juice
evs: 52 HP / 124 Atk / 220 Def / 76 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Stealth Rock is Tyrunt's main utility move. 
- Dragon Tail coming off 18 Attack hits quite hard and forces switches, spreading hazard damage.
- Fire Fang hits hard with Strong Jaw and nails Steel-types. 
- Brick Break can be used to hit Pawniard harder. 
- Stone Edge can be used for power, Rock Tomb for added utility of lowering Speed.

Set Details
========
- EVs keep Tyrunt's Attack high while maintaining good bulk, specifically to tank Brave Birds and Acrobatics. 
- Eviolite can be used effectively with slightly altered EVs (to get even defensive stat numbers) if used in conjunction with a Wish user. 

Usage Tips
========

- Tyrunt is a very physically bulky Pokemon, it should be used as a wall for Normal or Flying-types and take that opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or use Dragon Tail if it's already up. 
- Since Tyrunt has no reliable recovery of its own, Berry Juice or Wish are needed to give it longevity. 

Team Options
========

- Wish Spritzee is the obvious partner with Tyrunt. It can switch into Fighting-type attacks and keep Tyrunt alive with Wish. Tyrunt can also tank Poison-type attacks aimed at Spritzee. 
- Magnemite, Honedge, and Ferroseed are also quite useful as teammates since they can tank Steel- and Fairy-type attacks. 

Dragon Dance 
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Fire Fang / Brick Break
move 4: Stone Edge
ability: Strong Jaw
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 52 HP / 124 Atk / 76 SpD / 212 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Tyrunt's access to Dragon Dance with 14 Speed lets it outpace the unboosted metagame after a Dragon Dance. 
- Dragon Claw is Tyrunt's main STAB attack. 
- Fire Fang hits almost as hard as Dragon Claw with Strong Jaw and nails Steel-types. 
- Brick Break hits Pawniard harder. 
- Stone Edge is the most powerful attack in Tyrunt's arsenal, but its accuracy makes it generally a secondary choice.

Set Details
========
- EVs keep Tyrunt's Attack high while maintaining good bulk. 
- 212 EVs lets Tyrunt hit 14 Speed. 
- Eviolite and Berry Juice are personal preference. Eviolite lets Tyrunt survive a Moonblast from Spritzee while Berry Juice works better while trying to survive the onslaught of Fake Out, Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, or Gale Wings users. 

Usage Tips
========

- Tyrunt is a very physically bulky Pokemon, it should be used as a wall for  Normal or Flying-types and take that opportunity to set up Dragon Dance. 
- It is useful to wait until its counters are Knocked Off or weakened, then Dragon Dance to get the additional power and Speed to sleep. 

Team Options
========

- Wynaut can be useful for getting rid of Meditite and Timburr. 
- Scraggy, Mienfoo, and Timburr can be useful for luring in Spritzee and hitting it with Knock Off or Poison Jab. 

Other Options
########

- Rest + Sleep Talk is a viable option.
- Curse and Dragon Tail can be used as well. 
- Choice Scarf is a good revenge killer, but it lacks the sweeping power due to lacking Outrage. 

Checks & Counters
########
**Fairy-types**: Sprtizee and Snubbull.

**Fighting-types**: physically bulky and Fighting-type hits harder.
