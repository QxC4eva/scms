<div class="aside"><p>I shut the door, blocking out the frigid air and white snow. After settling down, I acknowledge a couple of figures hanging around, clearly not willing to brave the snow to get to anywhere else they want to be. I make a quick call to my interviewee, to confirm he's on his way to The Competitor offices to conduct the interview. A few minutes later, he steps in the room, sits down, and nods that he's ready to start the interview.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Hey Heist, thanks for taking the time out to do this interview. Congrats on your run in this year's Grand Slam.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>No problem.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Going to get right into the questions, what has been your highlight moment of the slam so far?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Uhh... Would have to be watching Bad Ass vs Bloo. It was a very good series to witness as a spectator.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>And as a player, have you had any memorable matches?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Hmm.... My games vs Malekith were pretty formulaic&mdash;perhaps the standout was when I played SoulWind in the UU Open&mdash;the first one, though. The second one was anything but.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Haha, care to give us details as to why?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>He wasn't prepared for Taunt + Will-o-Wisp Mew and when you are weak to it it's generally impossible to outmaneuver it.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>It's my understanding that Mew's a tad unpredictable to begin with.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Yea, he was using a stall team and nothing could 2HKO it I believe.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>I'd really like to have seen that match...</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>The hail vs rain one?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Yeah.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Cause the Mew game was pretty boring lol. Let me find it.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Heist pulls out a little electronic device, and starts scrolling through his files. After a wide variety of facial expressions pass over his face, from rage to pride to joy and everything in between, he looks up and shakes his head.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Yeah, I thought I might have the replay, but I cant find it.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>It's alright, don't worry about it</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I sit there for a bit, looking at my sheet&mdash;going into the interview, I had so many good questions, but now none of them seem worth asking...</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>What's your favorite Slam tier to play?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>RU, undeniably.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Any reason behind it?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>RU has a nice balance and a wealth of options. I find the other tiers can often be too hazards-centric&mdash;it is hard to set and maintain entry hazards in RU. I also feel that the tier is still somewhat unexplored.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I nod my head in understanding, as he goes on.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>As evidenced by seeing still a lot of innovation in Grand Slam matches to this day.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Anything particularly innovative you've personally seen?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>I'll keep my sets to myself but one example would have to be august's team he used vs Bad Ass. august brought six Flying-type Pokémon and very nearly won.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>My mind cannot help but think of a popular tournaments player who very much likes birds.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>You could not get away with a team like that in most of the other Grand Slam tiers.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Haha perhaps once this is over, august will share!</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>My eyes widen in awe.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>That's gold! Impressive, too.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Rotom-Mow / Natu / Moltres / Scyther / Sigilyph / Braviary was his lineup.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I think for a second&mdash;isn't Rotom...</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>My mistake, five Flying-type Pokémon.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Looks similar to something I ran for Monotype Tourney&mdash;that is very impressive.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Heist's mouth draws into a shape of what looks like a smile before continuing.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Yea, it takes a lot of guts to bring something like that.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>august is certainly a ballsy player.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Another voice piped up&mdash;apparently someone else was listening in on the interview, and was interested in asking a question.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="BKC" /><p>If I may, who did you think was the favorite to win the entire slam, both prior to the season and after the playoffs began?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>I knew that if I were to make the final I'd be up against either Bloo or Bad Ass and if I can manage to beat koko that prediction will be true. I just feel like while there were a lot of good players participating like Ciele, august, and Malekith, they weren't as focused on the tournament as those two. Bloo would probably have been the outright favorite though.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Have there been any players you've been looking forward to playing? Similarly, have there been any players you've dreaded once you saw the lineups?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>I always look forward to playing matches deep into tournaments, up until right before, but that feeling goes away after the first turn. But uh... I was hoping to get revenge on Nelson for last year but he didn't play this year I think... Oh yeah&mdash;I never like to play vs ShakeItUp.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>BKC nods in approval, adding that nobody likes playing against ShakeItUp.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>He plays very aggressively and always has momentum. Additionally, he also has outrageous luck. I think I played shake in the UU Open quarterfinals.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>cbt's head pops up from behind his computer, where he was fact-checking a previous statement of Heist. Or maybe he just knew everything beforehand, but that idea is a bit scarier.</p></div>

<div class="speaker cbt"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_cbt.png" alt="cbt" /><p>Actually Nelson did play but he didn't do as well.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Ah, OK.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Has anyone superseded your expectations in this year's Slam?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Hmm.... Yes; a couple of people.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Anyone you're willing to name?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>OK, I am surprised with how close blarajan vs Bloo was and blarajan also beat Ciele quite convincingly (with a fair bit of luck).</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Haha, typical blarajan.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>There's also kokoloko who had to bank a lot on his UU ability to do well in Slam and he barely lost UU Open, losing to Fuzznip in the last round in UU. aerialace TM40 too kinda forgot about him.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Lol&mdash;we all saw what happened in UU Slam finals and in UU in general.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="BKC" /><p>You mentioned preparing, and besides the standard of building/testing teams, do you have any pre-game rituals? for example, sacrificing goats (or as I've heard from user: Eo Ut Mortus, in your case, calves...)</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>My head swivels towards BKC&mdash;I make out what looks like animal hair on his coat before Heist responds.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Lol. Sometimes I like to just play a game beforehand usually vs Eo to help get my confidence up. Na... I make sure I have a couple of tabs open of Cherubi's Damage Calculator, put in some tunes. Although after I battle I realize I have no recollection of what I was listening to.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Heist gets three quick beeps on his device, and quickly excuses himself, promising he'll return in a minute. BKC stares at his retreating figure rush through the doorway, and jots down a quick question on a piece of paper and places it on the table before leaving the building himself.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="BKC" /><p>Last question from me: If you are to somehow fall to kokoloko, who will win the Second Official Grand Slam, him or user: Bad Ass?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>On Heist's return, he looks at the peice of paper, nods, and turns to me.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Uh, probably Bad Ass. I feel like I've been underestimating koko this entire interview which is kind of a bad idea since we are about to play soon lol but if koko does beat me and I play as well as I could have it will definitely be a tight game.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Is there a tier you feel he has the advantage in?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>koko's crux is UU and Bad Ass is quite good at UU as well, so that would definitely be one game to watch out for.</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Wait, did you mean koko or Bad Ass?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>koko.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>Or one you feel you've already been 1-0 down in before you even start?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Nope. I am actually really surprised with how well my UU team has turned out so we will see how that goes. I haven't really had much LC practice and koko used to play LC a lot so I think he might have the edge in that battle.</p></div>

<div class="speaker cbt"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_cbt.png" alt="cbt" /><p>Has the 1st tier been decided upon or is that too early to call?</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>I'll be selecting Uber for game 1.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bland"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bland.png" alt="bland" /><p>With what you've said, these will certainly be interesting games. We wish you the best of luck in all of them!</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>A head pops through the door, and a faint bleating can be heard outside.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="BKC" /><p>Make sure to sacrifice a goat before playing, I swear it works!</p></div>

<div class="speaker heist"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_heist.png" alt="Heist" /><p>Yes, one shoutout to kokoloko.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>With that, thanks, wishes of good lucks, and congratulations are passed around, and Heist leaves. cbt later swears that he saw BKC give Heist a goat outside the door, but the security cameras were sadly disabled, so it went unconfirmed.</p></div>
