<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/248.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 240 HP / 252 Atk / 16 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Payback</p>

<p>Tyranitar is the lead of my team, and does things almost perfectly. The main goal is to get Stealth Rock up as it helps my 3 life orb sweepers pick up a ton of OHKOs after Stealth Rock. And this is the reason I use Lum Berry, so I can take Spore / Sleep Powder from Roserade/Smeargle and simply OHKO back with Payback (killing them with sand). If they switch out, then Stealth Rock is almost guaranteed unless I am now up against a Lucario or something.</p>

<p>When making my lead, the only slot I knew I needed was Stealth Rock - having it up as soon as possible was going to be huge for my team. Since I knew I wanted Tyranitar as my lead for setting up Sandstorm (which does hurt 1/2 of the team, but more importantly, damages the opponent as well) and that he matches up extremely well against a lot of other leads, especially the sleep ones, I chose Payback. With 2 slots left, I had to decide whether or not to use Ice Punch for Gliscor, Superpower for almost perfect coverage with Payback, or Thunder Wave for status. I decided right away on Superpower as it hits other Tyranitar, as well as Heatran and the rare Lucario switch in, as well as if they try to set up against me. With finally Ice Punch or Thunder Wave to choose, I chose Thunder Wave, as statusing opposing Pokemon on the switch or mispredict can really help this team out. I considered many times about using Ice Punch because Dragonite and Gliscor leads are so annoying but I never really got around to changing one of the moves (likely Superpower into it).</p>

<p><strong>Shaymin</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 32 HP / 252 SpA / 224 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Bug<br />
- Seed Flare<br />
- Rest / Synthesis / Psychic<br />
- Earth Power</p>

<p>Probably the most dangerous sweeper on the entire team, including Infernape because of how versatile and bulky she is. There are very few games where Shaymin isn't responsible for at least 2 kills. I think what I really like most about Shaymin is the typing. Pure Grass is actually pretty excellent as it eliminates many of the weaknesses most Grass-types have and leave me weak only to Flying (never used), Bug (Scizor?), Poison (never used), Fire (used almost exclusively on other Grass-types and Fire-types), and Ice (The real dangerous one because there always could be a surprise Pokemon running it). 5 weaknesses may seem like a lot, but when you break them down as I did, its only really 2 actual ones that scare me. </p>

<p>The thing about Shaymin is that it needs so many moveslots. Seed Flare was the only slot guaranteed because there were so many viable options for the last 3 slots. I knew I wanted something to lure in Heatran and Infernape, as well as take on CM Jirachi if I absolutely needed to, so I chose Earth Power straight away (HP Fire is too risky for CM Rachi). Yet, I still wanted something to fight other Grass-types and Scizor (although Scizor is KOed by Seed Flare Drop + Earth Power). So I ended up taking both EP and HP Fire. In the last slot, I chose Rest, as instant recovery as long as you switch out is one of the best things ever, and Starmie was always able to spin away entry hazards. </p>

<p>Overtime, I saw a weakness of mine to Celebi and Gengar. I experimented a lot, especially with Hidden Power Bug and Psychic, to let me surprise kill these Pokemon. I eventually decided on HP Bug/Rest/Earth Power/Seed Flare as the new set, but then Synthesis caught my eye - yes, I have Sandstorm. But 25% recovery is still 25% recovery, especially when your opponent in constantly switching to try and wear down Shaymin. I experimented with Synthesis before realizing that losing the status recovery was just too much. I went back to HP Bug/Seed Flare/Rest/Earth Power, but then decided that HP Fire was just way too important to give up, especially with a new wave of Abomasnow coming in. My switches were for naught, but I liked everything anyway.</p>

<p>Timid 224 Speed lets Shaymin outspeed anything running 319 Speed specifically for Gliscor, because with HP Fire, I could only reach 327 Speed max anyway. 32 HP EVs gave my the LO number, always handy to have lying around. The rest went fully into Special Attack to provide that immediate power.</p>

<p><strong>Starmie</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 240 HP / 16 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Surf<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Recover<br />
- Rapid Spin</p>

<p>My Rapid Spinner / Gyarados Counter. Gyarados was definitely a huge problem for this team, but Starmie was a pretty successful counter unless a lot of prior damage is taken. This is also the perfect counter to Infernape in my eye.</p>

<p>I use Surf/Thunderbolt for this reason instead of Ice Beam for Dragonite or Flygon. Recover is a given for the ... recovery, and Rapid Spin is a must to keep Spikes/SR off my side of the field. If I am fighting a full stall team, I will actually save Starmie for later in the game, since I can't do too much damage to Ghosts/Tyranitar. Nothing is better than being able to come back against a stall team late in the game when their ghost is near death so that I can Rapid Spin. </p>

<p>There isn't much to say here except basically max HP and max Speed for bulk and speed. I don't like being outsped, even when playing the part of a bulky SpinStar</p>

<p><strong>Lucario</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Inner Focus<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Extremespeed<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>Physical Sweeper who can play mindgames with the opponent. Lucario can really mess up teams late, especially when I have Stone Edge and Jolly Nature to abuse, because not even Jolly Gyarados can be a safe revenge killer. I can not tell you how many times being Jolly has saved my life, as I have ended up fighting a lot of Lucario one on one, with the faster one (almost always me) coming out on top. </p>

<p>This was a pretty easy set for me, I knew Close Combat, ExtremeSpeed, and obviously Swords Dance were givens. I wasn't quite certain on the last move and I was leaning a ton of different ways on it. Bullet Punch would have finally solved my Gengar problems and could have really done a number on ScarfTar, Stone Edge was a pretty safe solution to dealing with Gyarados, Dragonite, and Zapdos, Ice Punch would have really stuck it to those Gliscor, and Crunch was obviously a great move for Rotom-h. So why Stone Edge? It hits every Pokemon I listed at the very least neutrally. That was basically how I made my desicion! I figured Bullet Punch would actually have much use outside of Gengar/ScarfTar so why really bother, especially if Gengar had a sub up anyway. Crunch only really hits Rotom-h and could hit Gengar on the switch, and Ice Punch, although nice, couldn't really do much to Rotom-h or Gyarados, two big problem mons. Stone Edge hit Rotom-h for 100 BP, nothing to scoff at, and Gyarados for 200, and when combined with a Swords Dance, that becomes nearly always a KO, even after Intimidate.</p>

<p><strong>Swampert</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Torrent<br />
EVs: 152 HP / 252 Atk / 104 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Punch</p>

<p>This is my surprise Pokemon and one of the most vicious CBers in the game. I really have changed this Pokemon up a lot, but I think this is the optimal set. CB STAB Earthquake from 525 Attack is going to wreck things, no matter what you are and how strong you think you are. Unless you are immune / resist while being very bulky, you are likely going to be killed. </p>

<p>The 3 other moves are there for scenarios where Earthquake won't finish the job. Leading out with Ice Punch is definitely a good idea, much like CB Gyara with Payback in Standard - Celebi/Shaymin are the 2 top switch-ins. Stone Edge provides an final last ditch effort to stop Gyarados if he becomes too scary, and Waterfall actually becomes the main attack if Swampert drops below 1/3 HP.</p>

<p>152 Speed EVs bring me to 182, 1 more than those who go to 181 to outspeed those who go to 180! Anything more is excessive >_>. I then put the rest in Attack and HP, to keep my bulk but make sure I was the strongest as I could be. </p>

<p><strong>Infernape</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Blaze<br />
EVs: 80 Atk / 176 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Grass Knot<br />
- Vacuum Wave</p>

<p>Mix Sweeper - You should know what this does x). If not, it is the most dangerous sweeper on the team (not my favorite or personal best though, that honor goes to Shaymin) and can rip through unprepared teams with good prediction.</p>

<p>Moves: The only real interesting one here in Vwave - it is a true last resort to stuff that needs to be finished off like Scarf Magnezone/Tran, and stuff like SD Lucario who survived everything else. Grass Knot can really take down opponents who use Cune/Star as counters assuming your prediction is good enough.</p>

<p>I run Max Speed because for some reason some don't, and so then I can just ko others with Close Combat.</p>
