<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Fails unless the user knows this move and at least one other move, and has used all the other moves it knows at least once each since it became active or Transformed. This move cannot be used if it is the user's only move; however, it can be used with only one other move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Last Resort has little competitive use. While powerful, the conditions that must be met to use this move are undesirable in a competitive setting. It is possible to build a sweeping set that uses this move, such as a Howl + Last Resort Stoutland that has no other moves, but Normal is a mediocre attacking type, which leaves the viability of this strategy in question.</p>
