[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and always hits three times, unless the opponent is KOed by the first or second hit. The Base Power of the move increases by 10 after each hit, so the first hit has a Base Power of 10, the second is 20, and the third is 30, for a total Base Power of 60. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate twice, and this move can KO through Focus Sash and Sturdy. If the first hit breaks a Substitute, the attack will continue to damage the target. Each hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. If the target holds a Chople, Jaboca, or Enigma Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat all hits as a single attack, and Color Change will only activate on the last hit of the move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Triple Kick should not be used competitively. Each individual hit has an independent chance to miss, and the move is no stronger than other, better Fighting-type moves. The move is unique to Hitmontop, who prefers to use Mach Punch and Close Combat.</p>
