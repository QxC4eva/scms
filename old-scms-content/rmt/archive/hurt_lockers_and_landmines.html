<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Yeah, so I haven't got time to make a lengthy RateMyTeam, as I really need some help with this swiftly. Basically this team is my laddering team, my ST6 team and my tournament team in general as of the past couple of months. I have used this to great success, but all of a sudden it has been failing in effectiveness with the rise of such Pokémon as offensive lead Machamp and Rash four-attack Heatran with Explosion and Hidden Power Grass. </p>

<p>The idea of the team is to set up Spikes and Stealth Rock with maximum defenses to prevent holes being created during the match. The secondary function of this team is to phaze away opponents to build up the accumulation of residue damage. This, in turn, allows Jirachi and Latias to have fun setting up and sweeping my weakened opponent. </p>

<p>This team has gotten me to the quater-finals of ST6 and #1 on the standard leaderboard, peaking at #2 several times prior and post landmark. The relevant alts are "HURT LOCKER" and "LANDMINE" - as the title implies. Please help me improve this team. :]</p>

<p>As this is my last RateMyTeam for sometime, I would like to thank the following users for making my time at Smogon worthwhile and fun: Bloo, Joel, joshe, Taylor, BlueKirby (for allowing me to tutor), Joel, Giant Enemy Crab, SoT, Haunter, MetaNite and j. franky. </p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/227.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Skarmory</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Keen Eye<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 128 SpD / 128 Spe<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Whirlwind<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Roost</p>

<p>Skarmory is probably the team's MVP; it has the perfect assets needed to make this team extremely successful. As a lead, Skarmory can take on many foes including Smeargle, Roserade, Swampert and Metagross - just to name a few. Taunt is the best part of the set as, with Lum Berry, it shuts down sleep-inducing leads and other switch-ins such as Rotom-A, so Tyranitar can come in with relative ease and remove it. Skarmory offers me a sound switch into Draco Meteors and Dragon Pulses from Salamence and Latias, respectively, but I must always be aware of the potential anti-Steel-type move: "Fire Blast at will", in which case Swampert is reluctantly pleased to come in and threaten Salamence's well-being.</p>

<p>Roost provides self-healing and durability. Whirlwind is another wonderful move; it removes problematic Pokémon and increase the build-up of residue damage from Spikes and/or Stealth Rock present - it also fucks up Wish passers such as Jirachi, too. Spikes is obviously why Skarmory is included on this team, aside from the aforementioned points. With Spikes, the team successfully abuses the damage they cause to land-based Pokémon - up to 25% - and how that eases the burden of offensively killing my opposition. Jirachi and Latias greatly appreciate this as they both lack the hardcore initial power that their other offensive sets would provide.

<p>The EVs allow Skarmory to outpace foes such as RestTalk Gyarados, opposing Taunt Skarmory and nullify any set up potential from Calm Mind Suicune whom carry minimum Speed investment. The main reason why these Pokémon "need outspeeding" is simple: they can alter the course and dominance of the match as this team relies on preventing the opponents from setting up. If they did, I am forced to pre-occupy myself with having to get rid of these Pokémon, which could come at a cost - especially if that means I lose a Pokémon which will consequently open big holes in the team and its effectiveness. </p>

<p>The HP and SpD EVs allow me to take hits from the special and physical sides of the attacking spectrum. This maximizes Spike-stacking effectiveness as I am not restricted to setting up on only one specified group of Pokémon - most notably physically-orientated Pokémon.</p>

<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Pursuit</p>

<p>Tyranitar is the clue of this team; it keeps everything in check and fills in all the little gaps that the team could not attend to otherwise. I was pretty skeptical about it when Taylor introduced the physical Choice Scarf Tyranitar in his RMT. The idea is simple; Tyranitar walks in on most resisted attacks and outpaces the unsuspecting foe. Tyranitar acts as my check to Life Orb Starmie, Classic MixMence (albeit a second-to-last resort) and most Latias. The moves involved need no comprehensive explanation, but the key to the set is Pursuit and Superpower. Pursuit in the sense that it can removed fleeing Gengar and Taunted Rotom-A, and Superpower because it allows me to check Lucario: they usually come in on Tyranitar, I go to Rotom-A and then switch back on the Crunch. </p>

<p>Sand Stream is a useful asset because it can negate any Focus Sash survival attempts of a lot of foes such as Roserade. In addition to being a useful revenge killer, Tyranitar maintains excellent synergy with my lead, Skarmory, in terms of dealing with opposing leads and other typical switch-ins that Swampert cannot switch into, for example.</p>

<p>The EV spread is basic and requires no real explanation, although they just maximize Tyranitar's potential Attack and Speed - enough so it can outpace foes such as Raikou, Life Orb Starmie and Azelf - basically Pokémon with up to base 115 Speed.</p>

<p><strong>Swampert</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Torrent<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Roar</p>

<p>Standard Swampert fills in the gap when it comes to my requirement of a Stealth Rock user. Its defenses and typing are ideal for me. With Swampert, I have a check to non-Hidden Power Grass Magnezone and Jolteon, and also something which can switch into Choice Band Metagross and Gliscor that may attempt to Taunt Skarmory. Swampert can also threaten Dragon Dance Salamence, Flygon and Dragon Dance Tyranitar - all, but Flygon to an extent, problems to the team if they are allowed to set up with relative ease. So, yeah: Ice Beam essentially screws up most Dragon-type Pokémon, and Earthquake deals with the prone aforementioned Pokémon. </p>

<p>Stealth Rock obviously contributes to the accumulation of passive damage in conjunction with Spikes and Sandstorm from Skarmory and Tyranitar, respectively. And with Roar, I am given another phazer to screw over stat-uppers and increase passive damage of potential switch-ins to Swampert and in general.</p>

<p>The EVs are standard, with slight more investment in Speed as opposed to "standard" Swampert so I don't lose the fight to get the fastest Roar. HP and Defense fight against the majority of relevant physical attackers.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-H</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 200 Def / 40 SpD / 16 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Will-o-Wisp</p>

<p>Rotom-h acts as my status absorber - taking sleep, paralysis and poison statuses like a boss. It allows me to take on foes such as Breloom more straightforward with Latias. Rest and Sleep Talk also provide me with the ability to pre-long life during a match. Thunderbolt hits foes such as Gyarados, Kingdra and Scizor - the latter especially with Will-O-Wisp to dampen down Pursuit's 2HKOing damage. Rotom-h not only acts as a check to the aforementioned Pokémon, but to Metagross and Bronzong and physical-based mixed Jirachi - which are all problems when it comes to dealing with them offensively. Rotom-h acts as my Rapid Spin blocker, too, which means I don't lose Spikes/Stealth Rock too early. The problem I have encountered lately, however, is the increase of Choice Band Gyarados (lol), which opens up a potential sweep from Swords Dance Scizor which could spell the end. </p>

<p>The EVs are Defensively orientated so I can a myriad of hits from physically-based Pokémon. The 40 SpD EVs allow Rotom-h to take the odd special attack from Defensive Starmie, etcetera. The 16 Speed means that I can outpace minimum Speed investing Suicune and opposing Rotom-h - though the latter situation isn't necessarily needed or helpful at times.</p>

<p><strong>Latias</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 192 HP / 64 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Roost<br />
- Roar / Reflect</p>

<p>Fantastic Pokémon. Latias sets up on so much its unbelievable. It acts as my check to so much such as Suicune, Infernape, Zapdos with Hidden Power Grass, mixed Salamence and also Substitute Rotom-h if Swampert is down for whatever reason. The way it wins a lot of bouts is through its ability to use Calm Mind which effectively eases off any damage taken by Latias. With Calm Mind, Latias' Dragon Pulse - only resisted by Steel-types, obviously - acts as a formidable opponent that struggle against set up Pokémon in general, but also opens up holes for Jirachi when it comes to show its face. Roost over Recover is personal preference as there is no difference between the two moves - yeah, that's right: no difference. </p>

<p>Roar acts as a useful tool in so many ways. With it, I can force out potential Calm Mind users that could prove problematic, or Pokémon in Substitutes (such as Breloom). This goes for other specially-orientated Pokémon in general, too, of course. Roar also allows me to get the upper hand on foes; I will set up along side the foe, until we both reach +6, then I suprise them with a Roar, phazing their boosts away. Like a boss. Roar also effectively removes Pursuiters from play without being KOed. This allows me to scout sets without sacrificing Latias which most over Calm Mind sets usually do without something like Reflect which I am considering (Reflect > Roar for Machamp, but I don't know how that would help me in the long term. :/)</p>

<p>The EVs are somewhat tweaked from Philip7086's Torment Heatran team, but I also had a feeling for the EVs in general anyway, so that's not troublesome. The HP EVs allow me to take hits. The SpD EVs are just to round my SpD stat to 300 (lol, pedantic), and the SpA EVs are to add impact to unboosted attacks. Timid nature + maximum Speed investment allows Latias to yield a total of 350 Speed to outpace Infernape and tie with opposing Latias (not risking it -.-) and Gengar (might risk it depending on the amount of Calm Minds I have and Tyranitar's state).</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/385.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Jirachi</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Serene Grace<br />
EVs: 80 HP / 176 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Iron Head<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Calm Mind</p>

<p>Simple offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, but with a difference: Iron Head. With Iron Head, Spikes and Stealth Rock, Jirachi is allowed to beat foes it once couldn't with an all-special moveset. Foes such as Blissey, Calm Mind Latias (if Tyranitar is down), Cradily (lol) and Choice Band Tyranitar - to name a few - all attempt to set up in some way against Jirachi when they see Calm Mind, but fall when Iron Head hits them for the 2HKO minimum with Stealth Rock/Spikes factored in depending on how Defensively orientated they are. Iron Head also provides me with some added luck against foes if I need it. I can also use Iron Head against foes to feign an all-physical moveset, which Suicunes, etcetera, attempt to set up on, but are surprised when I also use Calm Mind along side them which puts me at an advantage because I beat my opponent anyway with Thunderbolt (in this specific example). </p>

<p>Calm Mind boosts the power of Jirachi's STAB Psychic which hits weakened Swamperts, Gliscors and Rotom-A. Thunderbolt is my filler move that hits Suicune, Gyarados and other bulky Water- or Flying-type Pokémon. </p>

<p>Paired with Latias, Jirachi has awesome type synergy with her, creating the "perfect" offensive duo. With both Pokémon being Calm Mind sweepers - to be generic - my opponent is faced with double the onslaught and requires double the effort to defeat the couple, and therefore, double the amount of checks to Calm Mind users in general - it stresses my opponent, especially with Spikes and Stealth Rock factored. </p>

<p>Thunderbolt's chance of paralysis and Iron Head's chance of flinching, plus Serene Grace, means that Jirachi also has its infamous "ParaFlinching" power (and annoyance) against my opponents. This is especially relevant when it comes to battling Calm Mind Latias which is faster than me. It's a risk, though. </p>

<p>The EVs are simple but effective: I use 176 Attack for full effect when dealing with foes such as Latias, Tyranitar and other general Ice-types and Rock-type Pokémon. Iron Head's power goes unboosted in a match usually, so it appreciates all the power it can get. The 80 HP EVs allow me to take random hits from resisted attacks or when I'm in a Calm Mind war against the likes of Suicune, etcetera. The 252 Speed maximizes Jirachi's Speed so it can tie with foes such as Jolly Choice Band Flygon and Jolly/Naive Salamence so I can revenge with Psychic or flinch to death with Iron Head if I am lucky. </p>
