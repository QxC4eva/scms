Overview
########

Doduo is an underrated and strange bird; it has amazing 19 Attack and 18 Speed stats and Brave Bird, which makes it a solid wallbreaker in Little Cup. However, it has an average ability, no reliable coverage moves at all, and low defenses. In comparison, Fletchling finds it easier to sweep thanks to Gale Wings and Tailow is much more stronger than Doduo (when using Toxic Orb + Guts) and faster. However, Doduo still has some advantages over them. It is quite stronger than Fletchling, it is a tad bulkier than Tailow, and can use the more reliable Life Orb. Access to Knock Off distinguishes Doduo from Tailow and Fletchling, giving it more chances to support the team. It has another great tools like Pursuit and Quick Attack. Overall, though it is walled by several top threats and easily taken out by Pawniard, Doduo should not be underestimated; with the right support, it can be a deadly wallbreaker and revenge killer.

Life Orb Bird
########
name: Life Orb Bird
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Quick Attack
move 4: Hidden Power Fighting / Return
ability: Early Bird
item: Life Orb
evs: 236 Atk / 240 Spe
nature: Naive / Jolly
ivs: 19 HP

Moves
========

Brave Bird is an obligatory STAB move that smashes anything which doesn't resist it, especially top threats such as Scraggy, Cottonee, and Mienfoo; even walls that don't resist it are 2HKOed such as Porygon. Knock Off is used for supporting the team; it also 2HKOes standard Slowpoke and has a very high chance to OHKO Eviolite Misdreavus after Stealth Rock. Quick Attack is an important way to revenge kill threats such as Fletchling, Croagunk, and Timburr without fearing their priority moves; after an opposing pokemon switches into Doduo and takes Brave Bird damage, Quick Attack let Doduo KO a target which is faster than it or likely has a Choice Scarf. Hidden Power Fighting is basically for KOing Pawniard, but it also does solid damage to Magnemite. Return is a secondary STAB option for hitting Electric-types such as Chinchou.

Set Details
========
The EV spread is used for always hitting hard and fast. Jolly gives Doduo an above-average Speed tier. Naive is used with Hidden Power Fighting. Early Bird is the best of Doduo's three abilities; it can be useful for waking up early in case Doduo switches into a sleep-inducing move, like Foongus's Spore. Life Orb allows Doduo to act as a wallbreaker.

Usage Tips
========
Avoid switching in Doduo if you aren't sure if it will be into a Ghost- or Ground-type move. Use it late-game when Doduo's counters are already KOed or to revenge kill something weak to Brave Bird; most Pokemon can't easily switch into Doduo's Brave Bird late-game. Volt Switch and U-turn are safe ways to bring Doduo into battle. Spam Knock Off early-game so Doduo's offensive teammates may have an easy time sweeping.

Team Options
========
Chinchou forms a very good core with Doduo; it can safely bring Doduo into battle with Volt Swich. Drilbur is another good partner as it can both set up Stealth Rock and use Rapid Spin. Drilbur KOes Rock- and Steel-types, and Chinchou KOes Rock-types too. Doduo KOes both Drilbur's and Chinchou's counters, especially Grass-types. In general, Doduo can form very good offensive cores with Pokemon weak to Fighting-types, like Pawniard; Pawniard supports Doduo by Knocking Off opposing Eviolites. Finnaly, Doduo forms another good offensive core with Archen. Archen has access to Defog, and they KO each other's counters. Earthquake breaks the Chinchou + Pawniard core which causes a lot of trouble to Doduo.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Return / Double-Edge
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Pursuit / Hidden Power Fighting
ability: Early Bird
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 236 Atk / 240 Spe
nature: Adamant / Naughty / Jolly

Moves
========
Brave Bird and Knock Off are staples. The former smashes through common threats such as Scraggy and Mienfoo and even 2HKOes a lot of threats that don't resist it such as Misdreavus with its sheer power. Knock Off is a utility option that can OHKO Eviolite Misdreavus (after Stealth Rock) and 2HKO standard Slowpoke. Return is a secondary STAB option for hitting Chinchou, but if recoil isn't an issue, you can use Double-Edge. Pursuit is here for revenge killing key opposing Pokemon so they won't cause you trouble later. Hidden Power Fighting is basically for KOing Pawniard, but it also does solid damage to Magnemite.

Set Details
========
The EV spread is simple as Doduo's main aim is to hit hard and fast. The main nature on this set is Adamant, as Doduo doesn't have Life Orb for power anymore. Naughty should be used with Hidden Power Fighting. Use Jolly for outspeeding Timid Choice Scarf Chinchou, Jolly Choice Scarf Mienfoo, and Speed tying with Choice Scarf Gastly; while they aren't that common, they can be an issue. Early Bird still is the only ability Doduo will run anyway.


Usage Tips
========

Use Pursuit against those threats that the opponent will probably switch out such as Misdreavus, Abra, and Gastly; however, there are many situations pursuit could be use besides trapping Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon. You can always use Pursuit to trap any opposing threat that your opponent doesn't want to lose like spinners, clerics, hazard setters, and so on. Again, exercise caution when switching Doduo in; in this regard, take advantage of Doduo's Ghost and Ground immunities. Doduo should be used for revenge killing specific targets such as Choice Scarf Pawniard and +1 Scraggy or Choice Scarf Scraggy. Volt Switch and U-turn are a good way to bring Doduo into battle. Use it late-game or to revenge kill.

Team Options
========

Chinchou makes a great partner, bringing Doduo into battle and KOing some of its counters such as Tirtouga. Drilbur is good to remove and set up Stealth Rock while dealing with Steel-types. This set is more able to deal with Pawniard than the Life Orb one as right now, the most common Pawniard set is the Choice Scarf one, so Cottonee is another good teammate; it can lock the opposing Pokemon into a Ground- or a Ghost-type move so Doduo can come into battle safely. Cottonee easily KOes Tirtouga, a very common Doduo counter. Doduo can form very good offensive cores with Pokemon weak to Fighting-types like Pawniard; Pawniard supports Doduo by Knocking Off opposing Eviolites. Finally, Archen can remove Stealth Rock and break the core of Chinchou + Pawniard.


Other Options
########

A set with the only Attack-boosting move Doduo learns, Work Up, can be used with Hidden Power. However, Doduo's frailty makes it very hard to set up. A Focus Sash set with Flail (or Endeavor) + Quick Attack also work but usually will work only once, and needs a lot of support from your team. Drill Peck can be used when you want to avoid recoil. Double Hit breaks Substitute, Focus Sash, and Sturdy but it is much weaker than Double-Edge or Return. Roost can be used on the Life Orb set for recovering recoil or Stealth Rock damage. Steel Wing is a guaranteed 2HKO on defensive Archen with Life Orb.


Checks & Counters
########


**Steel-types**: Doduo can't do anything to Steel-types; they are all bulky, resist its STAB moves, and can even set up in Doduo. Pawniard easily KOes Doduo with some prediction.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types resist both of Doduo's STAB moves and have a STAB super effective move to KO Doduo with. A very dangerous counter is Tirtouga, which can easily set up Shell Smash/Stealth Rock while walling Doduo.

**Misdreavus**: Misdreavus can check Doduo with Thunderbolt or just burn it. However, it is 2HKOed by Knock Off.

**Electric-types**: Most Electric-types are too frail to act as a counter to Doduo, but they can still check it easily with their STAB moves.

**Strong Physical Walls**: Physical walls can sponge anything Doduo throws at them, especially if they have recovering moves. For instance, Hippopotas KOes it with Rock Slide or just stall with Slack Off untill recoil KOes Doduo.
