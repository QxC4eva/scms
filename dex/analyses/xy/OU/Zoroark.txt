Zoroark

Overview
########
- Zoroark used to live and die by its gimmick, Illusion, but the Dark-type buff changed that.
- Zoroark is now less reliant on coverage and hard to switch into, threatening without Illusion.
- It only has to worry about Fighting-, Dark-, and Fairy-type resists.
- It boasts high Speed and Special Attack.
- Being walled by Fairy-types is bad for it.
- Horrid frailty makes it unable to switch into basically anything.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Low Kick
ability: Illusion
item: Focus Sash
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Focus Sash + Illusion nets Swords Dances.
- Knock Off is a powerful STAB that has the added utility of removing items.
- Sucker Punch provides priority to hit faster Pokemon and other priority users with.
- Low Kick gives important coverage on Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, Kyurem-B. and Heatran.

Set Details
========
- It cannot handle Fairies and some bulky Fighting-types
- Jolly allows more favorable matchups against Mega Pinsir, due to Quick Attack, and virtually anything around base 100 Speed that it needs Knock Off to KO (think Manaphy).
- Adamant packs a significantly higher punch.

Usage Tips
========
- Keep in mind Illusion is a tool, not a necessity. Zoroark is plenty scary by itself with high Speed and powerful Dark-type STAB alone.
- Seriously, never compromise an advantageous situation just to give Zoroark's Illusion a better chance of fooling the opponent later.
- Zoroark shouldn't been switching into attacks ever. Even resisted attacks will do tons, and break Illusion.

Team Options
========
- Terrakion makes a fantastic Illusion and lures Gliscor in for a Knock Off.
- Skarmory can use both Defog and Stealth Rock, which are necessary to support Zoroark.
- Pokemon that lure in and KO Fairy- and Fighting-types are welcomed.
- Mega Venusaur covers Zoroark's weaknesses and makes for a decent Illusion as well.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Dark Pulse
move 2: Extrasensory
move 3: Flamethrower
move 4: Trick
ability: Illusion
item: Choice Specs
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Dark has great coverage alone.
- Illusion with a powerful Specs-boosted Dark Pulse makes for a significant threat.
- Extrasensory hits Fighting-types and Mega Venusaur.
- Flamethrower OHKOes most Steel-types, providing coverage that is most important for Mega Mawile.
- Trick disrupts stall and works well with Illusion.

Set Details
========
- The EVs and nature are conducive to it filling the role of a speedy, strong special attacker.

Usage Tips
========
- Fighting-type physical attackers make the best Illusions for this set.
- You can create situations where Zoroark can clear out checks for its Illusion partner and have the Pokemon easily sweep later.
- Keep in mind Illusion is a tool, not a necessity. Zoroark is plenty scary by itself with high Speed and powerful Dark-type STAB alone.
- Seriously, never compromise an advantageous situation just to give Zoroark's Illusion a better chance of fooling the opponent later.

Team Options
========
- Terrakion, Conkeldurr, and Aegislash all make fantastic Illusions so long as Stealth Rock is off the field.
- Any hazards can help net KOs; Sticky Web is especially nice with Specs, blocking Pokemon such as Deoxys-S and Thundurus from revenge killing it.
- Pokemon that lure in and KO Fairy- and Fighting-types are welcomed

Other Options
========
- Mixed sets can potentially work well with STAB Sucker Punch backed up by Zoroark's decent special movepool.
- Nasty Plot might be tempting, but many common OU Pokemon outpace Zoroark whether via Speed or priority, while Zoroark lacks the special priority moves to hit them first.
- Focus Blast can nail Dark-types on Special sets, but a missed attack can easy spell the end of Zoroark&mdash;it's too risky.
- Night Daze is slightly more powerful than Dark Pulse but trades a 20% flinch rate and 100 accuracy for 95 accuracy and a 40% chance to drop opponent's accuracy.

Checks and Counters
========
**Fairy-types**: Clefable, Sylveon, Azumarill, Togekiss, and Mega Mawile all wall Zoroark, for the most part, and can take it out with their super effective STABs.

**Bulky Dark-types** Mandibuzz and Tyranitar in particular are annoying obstacles for Zoroark to overcome.
 
**Bulky Mega Pokemon**: Mega Venusaur and Will-O-Wisp Mega Charizard X give physical Zoroark trouble, as Knock Off has only 65 BP against them.

**Faster threats and priority**: Due to its frailty and general dearth of resistances, special Zoroark is pretty easy to take out with faster Pokemon like Thundurus, Raikou, Mega Manectric, Greninja, (Mega) Alakazam, Tornadus-T, and Deoxys-S. Priority users, such as (Mega) Scizor, Azumarill, Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Mega Pinsir, also fare well. Boosted Sucker Punches from the likes of Bisharp and Mega Mawile can do a number, too.
