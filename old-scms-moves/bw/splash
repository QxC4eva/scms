<h2>Description </h2>
<p>User splashes around, doing nothing at all. This move cannot be used while Gravity is active.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Yeah. Unless you're running a Wobbuffet and want your opponent to burst a blood vessel with frustration, you shouldn't use this. Even if you're trying to be extremely cruel to your opponent, generally speaking it's outclassed by such gems as Choice Band Kakuna and a team of Unown that spell "ORDURE".</p>
