[Overview]

<p>Venusaur is faster than Exeggutor, which is nice. Razor Leaf hits most OU Pokemon pretty hard, like Starmie, Rhydon, Golem, Slowbro, and Tauros. Overall a pretty good Pokémon; he should put something to sleep and do some damage before fainting.</p>

[SET]
name: Sleep Powder
move 1: Razor Leaf
move 2: Sleep Powder
move 3: Swords Dance
move 4: Body Slam

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>As he is faster than the Exeggutor lead, he can get an early Sleep Powder in and paralyze the next Pokémon with Body Slam. After a Swords Dance, he nearly 2HKOs Chansey with Body Slam. Razor Leaf is almost an OHKO on Starmie thanks to its critical hit rate. If the opponent lets their Exeggutor sleep and they don't have a Gengar, they may have trouble on their hands, as Venusaur can deal a good amount of damage to most Pokémon on a standard RBY team.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hyper Beam can always work with Swords Dance; you can put it over Sleep Powder if you've got plenty of other sleep users, or over Razor Leaf if you think you can wear down Golem and Rhydon with something else and finish them with Swords Dance-boosted Hyper Beam. Growth works in conjunction with Mega Drain, but it's not really recommended.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gengar, Exeggutor, Zapdos, Moltres, and Articuno are the best counters, as Venusaur really can't do much to them at all and is forced to switch out. Gengar and Exeggutor are especially good counters since Gengar is either resistant or immune to anything Venusaur will use and Exeggutor doesn't mind paralysis too much, and will fire back with a very powerful Psychic. The legendary birds, once in, will be able to scare off Venusaur, but do not want to be switched into a paralyzing Body Slam. Alakazam and Jynx can switch in on a predicted Razor Leaf, but must be slightly more careful of Hyper Beam or Body Slam. Venusaur also takes a good amount of damage from a Rhydon using Earthquake, so try not to switch him into it often.</p>
