<h2>Introduction</h2>
 
<p>Smogon is a very large and sometimes scary site with everything that is going on. Tournaments, Tiering, Let's Plays, Creating Pok&eacute;mon, Research, and Socializing are just <em>some</em> of the things which you can delve into through your time here.</p>

<h2>General Metagame Ideas and Topics</h2>

<p>The articles below cover broader ideas of competitive battling. Most of these articles are primers before you really jump into the whole competitive scene. They can give you a better idea of what the opponent is thinking, how to help in your predicting, and, hopefully, how to make yourself a better player. Some of these articles may be based on Gen 5 Pok&eacute;mon/styles, but their broad ideas are applicable to any metagame you wish to play. Note: some of the Generation 5 articles may highlight moves/abilities which are not as useful now as they were due to changes in mechanics.</p>

<p>For Defog:</p>

<p>Apart from Rapid Spin, the newly-buffed Defog now provides another way to get rid of entry hazards. Defog clears both the user and the opponent's side of the field of all entry hazards, Reflect and Light Screen, and lowers the opponent's evasiveness. This is extremely useful because there is no guaranteed way to block Defog. This allows offensive teams to utilize powerful Pok&eacute;mon such as Mega Pinsir and Charizard, both of which are weak to Stealth Rock, by instantly clearing the field. Stall teams are also able to switch more freely with the help of Defog without fearing entry hazards. Methods of discouraging Defog include using Defiant users such as Bisharp and Thundurus; however, teams with Defog often carry ways of beating those threats. As such, there is no guaranteed way of keeping entry hazards on the field with Defog's introduction. Common users of Defog in OU include Latias, Mandibuzz, and Mega Scizor.</p>

<h2>Team Building Help and Ideas</h2>

<p>Team building is a question we get asked about a lot in terms of what #mentor talks about. It's probably one of the hardest skills to develop without getting very furstrated with either the ladder or Pok&eacute;mon in general. Sometimes its worth sitting back for a time and trying something totally different.</p>

<p><a href="/smog/issue11/weaknesses">It's Super Effective! Worst Weaknesses in Competitive Pokémon</a></p>

<p>Analyzing your team is a good place to see if you have weaknesses. Right off the bat, if you give #mentor a team, chances are someone will point out a huge weakness to your team that you may have already found out by playtesting with the team.</p>

<p>Please do not hesitate to look up our sister forum, <a href="/forums/forums/battling-101.42/">Battling 101</a> if you already know about competitive battling and want some additional guidance. Be warned that they have limited numbers of people accepted to each round of Tutoring.</p>

<h2>Alternative Metagame Articles and Help</h2>

<p>Smogon is home to a huge variety of metagames which are still developing for Generation 6 (XY). Currently, Smogon supports Official Tiers for Ubers, OU (Over Used), UU (Under Used), RU (Rarely Used), NU (Never Used), LC (Little Cup), Doubles, and VGC (Video Games Championship, Nintendo's own metagame).</p>

<p>Alternatively, Pok&eacute;mon Showdown (as well as Smogon) supports "Other Metagames," which stem from either the game (Inverse Battles, Sky Battles) or from peoples own ideas (OffStat, STABMons) which modify the games properties and can lead to very different gaming experiences. These can be found in the Other Metagames forum <a href="/forums/forums/other-metagames.206/">here</a>.</p>

<p>As a final thought, the people over at the Create-A-Pok&eacute;mon Project also have their own ladder which doesn't really fit into any of the above categories. CaP, as it is commonly known, creates Pok&eacute;mon which do battle across the tier of OU and attempts to understand and learn about the metagame.</p>
