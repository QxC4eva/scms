    ########

        Shadow Tag makes it able to easily trap and dispatch threats to a team making it a valuable teammate in many different teams. Unlike its cousin Wobbuffet, it actually has some form of offensive presence
        Reasonable special move pool allows Gothitelle to tailor it to take down certain threats, and lets it dismantle cores of common defensive threats such as Mega Venusaur, Skarmory, and Heatran, as well as revenge offensive threats as well, depending on the set
        Average stats overall, with nothing particularly standout aside from an above average Special Defense. This leaves the Scarf set quite weak offensively and it can only trap weakened Pokemon, while the Specs set is quite slow and can only deal with defensive Pokemon
        Psychic-typing isn't really that impressive, offensively or defensively

        Psychic is Gothitelle's main STAB attack, and it is also essential for breaking through Mega Venusaur, a defensive staple
        Psyshock can fulfill a similar role, but it is more effective against things like Sylveon and Blissey, if one does not want to use Trick
        Thunderbolt is used for Skarmory and bulky regular Gyarados
        Hidden Power Fire is an option in the third slot for Ferrothorn and Forretress
        Hidden Power Ice is used for Gliscor and provides good coverage with Thunderbolt
        Trick cripples Blissey, Chansey, Sylveon and any other defensive Pokemon or Pokemon with Assault Vest
        Signal Beam for Celebi
        Grass Knot OHKOes Hippowdon
        Hidden Power Ground is specifically for Heatran and the rare Jirachi in rain
        Shadow Ball for weakened Psychic-types such as Cresselia
