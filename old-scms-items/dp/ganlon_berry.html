[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holders Defense can be raised, it is raised one stage when HP falls to 25% or less. One-time use.</p>


<p>Provides a one-time 80 Base Power Ice-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Despite being part of the pinch Berry family, the Ganlon Berry will only activate with the wrong effect at the worst moment possible. Like the other pinch Berries, the Ganlon Berry requires the user's health to be well under 25%, which isn't exactly the best opportunity to boost your Pokemon's Defense. At this point, the user is in definite KO range, meaning that a Defense boost would be a wasted effort. Unless your Pokemon has some reliable way to recover health instantly, the Ganlon Berry should never be an option over staple items such as Leftovers.</p>
