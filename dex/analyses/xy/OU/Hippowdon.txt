Overview
########

Hippowdon is one of the best mixed walls in the game, checking some of the metagame's most prominent threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Garchomp. It has everything a wall could want; good typing, great bulk, and reliable recovery. It also has good supporting options in Stealth Rock and Whirlwind, and is useful on sand teams due to its ability, Sand Stream. Its attacks also pack quite a punch for a defensive Pokemon. However, it is painfully slow and has common weaknesses to Water- and Ice-type moves. It also has to rely on Whirlwind to stop setup sweepers, making it somewhat easy to wear down Hippowdon.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Slack Off
move 4: Toxic / Rock Slide / Whirlwind
ability: Sand Stream / Sand Force
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Earthquake is a strong STAB attack that deters frail sweepers from setting up on Hippowdon. Stealth Rock is a great support move and Hippowdon is very good at setting it up due to its great bulk. Slack Off provides reliable recovery making it more difficult to wear it down. The last slot depends on what your team needs. Toxic cripples opposing walls such as Mandibuzz and Rotom-W, making it easier for teammates to sweep. Rock Slide breaks Air Balloon and covers Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Pinsir. If your team can handle them, consider Whirlwind as it gets rid of your opponent's stat boosts while racking up entry hazard damage. It is Hippowdon's best chance against bulkier set-up sweepers like Mega Scizor.

Set Details
========

The EV spread and nature are straightforward. Max HP, Max Special Defense, and a Careful nature maximize Hippowdon's Special Defense, allowing it to check some powerful special attackers such as Thundurus, Aegislash, Gengar, and Mega Charizard Y. Leftovers is used to provide passive recovery which could mean the difference between an OHKO or 2HKO. Sand Stream is the preferred ability as it lets Hippowdon check Mega Charizard Y, although Sand Force can be used if Sand Stream is detrimental to rest of your team. Smooth Rock with Sand Stream can be used to provide a sweeping opportunity for Sand Rush Excadrill or to give a boost to Mega Garchomp's Earthquake and Stone Edge, as it extends the number of sand turns to 8.

Usage Tips
========

Try to keep Hippowdon as healthy as possible if there is a Pokemon on the opposing team that can be checked by Hippowdon, as its low Speed often forces it to take 2 hits before it can fire off an attack. Keep in mind that Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock several times, so you don't have to worry too much about Defog or Rapid Spin. Thanks to its naturally high Defense stat, it can take weaker physical attacks easily. If you see a Pokemon that is badly affected by sandstorm on the opposing team, such as Chansey or Mega Venusaur, always try to take advantage of it.

Team Options
========

A way of controlling entry hazards on your side, such as Defog, is appreciated as Hippowdon can potentially be 2HKOed by taking entry hazard damage followed by two hits from the opponent. Latias and Mega Scizor are good candidates, having solid synergy with Hippowdon. Hippowdon also appreciates teammates that can switch into Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks aimed at it, such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur. The former can also lay Spikes, which can quickly wear down the opponent in conjunction with Stealth Rock, sand, and Whirlwind. If you are using Mega Venusaur, be sure to use Sand Force as Hippowdon's ability as Sand Stream reduces Synthesis recovery. Mega Garchomp and Sand Rush Excadrill also appreciate the sand provided by Hippowdon, becoming a fearsome wallbreaker or sweeper, respectively; however, this strategy's viability has been hit hard by the weather nerf.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Slack Off
move 4: Toxic / Rock Slide / Whirlwind
ability: Sand Force / Sand Stream
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

The moveset is exactly the same as the Specially Defensive set. Earthquake is the obligatory STAB attack that hits fairly hard and prevents it from being setup bait. Stealth Rock is arguably the best move in the game and Hippowdon is a good user of it due to its great bulk. Slack Off provides reliable recovery, further augmenting its walling capabilities. The last slot depends on what your team needs. Toxic cripples common switch-ins such as Rotom-W and Mandibuzz, as well as opposing walls. Rock Slide breaks Air Balloon and covers Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Pinsir. Stone Edge can be used to OHKO Mega Pinsir, but most of the time Rock Slide is enough. If your team can handle the aforementioned Pokemon well, consider Whirlwind, as it gets rid of your opponent's stat boosts and racks up entry hazard damage. It is Hippowdon's best chance against bulkier set-up sweepers like Mega Scizor.

Set Details
========

The given EVs along with an Impish nature maximize Hippowdon's physical bulk so that it can check or counter a multitude of physical attackers in the tier, such as Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, Garchomp, and Mega Mawile. A spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 SpD with an Impish nature can be used, allowing Hippowdon to take 2 Shadow Balls from max Special Attack Aegislash after Stealth Rock. Leftovers provides passive recovery which always comes in handy. Sand Force is the preferred ability because this set does not need sand to fulfill its purpose and sand is generally a nuisance for the rest of the team, but Sand Stream can be used if one of its teammates appreciates sand support. Smooth Rock with Sand Stream can be used to extend the number of sand turns to 8, providing a sweeping opportunity for Sand Rush Excadrill and giving a boost to Mega Garchomp's Earthquake and Stone Edge.

Usage Tips
========

Use this set if your team lacks Stealth Rock and needs a bulky Pokemon to check physical threats, such as Terrakion, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Talonflame. Always try to keep Hippowdon as healthy as possible because it will almost always move last, forcing it to withstand two attacks. Keep in mind that Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock several times, so you don't have to worry much about Defog or Rapid Spin. Its Special defense is not as impressive as its Defense, so be wary of switching into even moderately strong special attacks.

Team Options
========

Hippowdon appreciates teammates that can take on special attackers easily, such as Chansey and Latias. The former can also rid Hippowdon of any status effect that it might have been inflicted with, while the latter can use Defog to support the team. Speaking of Defog, entry hazard control is necessary as Hippowdon can potentially be 2HKOed by taking entry hazard damage followed by two hits from the opponent. Something to take on Mega Gyarados, Azumarill, and other Water-types is also appreciated. Ferrothorn can do this and has good synergy with Hippowdon. Rotom-W makes a great teammate, as it can take Water- and Ice-type attacks for Hippowdon. Mega Venusaur is a very good teammate as it can check most of the Water- and Grass-types that tend to switch into Hippowdon, and is not weak to Ice-type moves, thanks to Thick Fat. Hippowdon in return can check Talonflame and Mega Pinsir who threaten Mega Venusaur. Mega Garchomp and Sand Rush Excadrill also appreciate the sand provided by Hippowdon, becoming a fearsome sweeper or wallbreaker respectively; however, this strategy's viability has been hit hard by the weather nerf.

Other Options
########

Ice Fang can be used on either set to hit Garchomp and other pokemon weak to Ice for heavy damage, but it is very weak otherwise and it is generally better to use Toxic or Whirlwind. Stone Edge is an option if you are not running Sand Stream and your team struggles against Mega Pinsir. An offensive set can be used due to its good offensive movepool but compromising with Hippowdon's bulk is not a good option.

Checks & Counters
########

**Water-types** Almost all common Water-types, such as Azumarill, Gyarados, Mega Gyarados, Keldeo, and Rotom-W force Hippowdon out with their respective STAB moves, while Hippowdon can't do much to them in return.

**Grass-types** Grass-types such as Breloom, Mega Venusaur, and Ferrothorn can easily switch into Hippowdon and hit back hard with their respective STAB moves. Breloom can Spore and proceed to set up with Swords Dance, while Mega Venusaur can use Leech Seed or deal heavy damage with Giga Drain, and Ferrothorn can set up entry hazards.

**Powerful Special Attackers** Strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y can break through Hippowdon with strong special attacks.

**Ice-types** Common Ice-types like Kyurem-B can easily KO Hippowdon with their respective STAB moves, although most of them have to be wary of switching into Rock Slide.

**Opposing Hazard Setters** Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Deoxys-D can setup hazards, while Hippowdon can't do anything to them in return besides phazing them out.

**Status** Toxic and Will-O-Wisp are very detrimental to Hippowdon, slowly wearing it down so that a strong attacker can overwhelm it.

**Trick and Switcheroo** Trick and Switcheroo users can cripple Hippowdon for the rest of the match as it can't wall opposing threats if it is locked into one move.
