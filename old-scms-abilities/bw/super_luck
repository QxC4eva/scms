<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The critical hit rate of moves used by the wielder is boosted by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The two Pokemon that stand out as decent users of Super Luck are <a href="/bw/pokemon/absol">Absol</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/honchkrow">Honchkrow</a>. Both are really too frail to be used in OU, and because of that you will rarely see them, but Super Luck is a better ability than <a href="/bw/abilities/pressure">Pressure</a> on Absol at least, especially as Absol has access to many high critical hit moves such as <a href="/bw/moves/night_slash">Night Slash</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/psycho_cut">Psycho Cut</a>. For the most part though you will see Honchkrow use <a href="/bw/abilities/moxie">Moxie</a>, as the Attack boosts will be more helpful. Still, a nice ability if you have the luck to use it.</p>
