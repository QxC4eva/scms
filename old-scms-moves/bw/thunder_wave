<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Thunder Wave is an extremely useful move, and possibly the best and most widely distributed status-inducing move in the game. It provides 100% accurate paralysis, and with high distribution, can be used by a ton of Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn and Slowbro. Although Ground-types are immune, this move is almost always a safe bet, and will rarely disappoint. While paralysis isn't as useful as sleep, and some would argue burn, it is still extremely useful for a variety of reasons and can be used for many different strategies. As paralysis cuts the Speed of the inflicted almost down to nothing, it makes it suddenly plausible for normally slow Pokemon to outspeed the enemy's team and take them out one by one. Paralysis also tends to fully incapacitate the opponent in the most useful of times, and this can be further abused with the use of flinching moves and confusion. When combined with confusion, the condition is normally referred to as parafusion. Throw in a flinching move to confusion, and suddenly the opponent has a very low chance of moving successfully. This strategy is most commonly abused by Jirachi and Togekiss, who also sport the Serene Grace ability to make their flinching moves a higher chance to cause the opponent to flinch. A very annoying, and powerful, strategy indeed.</p>
