<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For those of you that know me, you'll know I love Ubers in comparison to the other tiers. Ludicolo is an odd Pokémon on this Uber team, and this team has been very successful for me (a variation of it peaked at #7 on the ladder) and I know a few others have used this team and enjoyed relative success with it. The team basically softens the opponent up for a Palkia sweep.</p>

<p>The whole idea of the team was originally to show what a force Ludicolo is in Ubers, using it to support the rest of my team mates in aiding a late-game Palkia sweep.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/383.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Groudon</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Drought<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 216 Def / 12 SpD / 28 Spe<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Roar<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Flamethrower</p>

<p>Purposely avoiding the usage of Deoxys-S, I plucked for Groudon as my lead. The hopefully early usage of Stealth Rock means I can wear the opponent down from the start of the match. It helps the team deal with Lugia with much more ease, and often limits Life Orb Rayquaza if I find myself in a sticky situation.</p>

<p>Roar is your standard move, and gives me a get out clause under many situations. If Giratina-O manages to grab a Calm Mind or Substitute on any of my Pokémon I can use Groudon's Roar to stop any sweeping attempts, now having more information about the opposing Pokémon which I can use to play around with later. It also helps against teams that use Lugia as their sole Groudon switch-in, as the Stealth Rock damage really kicks in.</p>

<p>While Groudon is my lead, often I am unable to attain that much wanted early Stealth Rock. However, Groudon's bulk allows it to often come in mid-game and set up Stealth Rock for Palkia's late-game sweep. </p>

<p>Now for the last moveslot, Flamethrower. One day I was discussing the team with Kinneas, and previously I was using Dragon Claw. However, the thought of Forretress leads setting up entry hazards early game was not nice, and Kinneas brought up the idea of Fire Blast netting a surprise OHKO, meaning it couldn't set up its hazards mid-game either. Eventually I decided to pluck for Flamethrower, because it is OHKOing Careful 252 HP / 252 SDef Forretress 92% of the time, which is better than Fire Blast. Fire Blast also only OHKOes 252 HP / 0 SDef Skarmory 34.88% of the time (factoring in accuracy), so I would prefer to run Flamethrower for a solid 2HKO anyway. Early game I will often Earthquake Forretress to fool the opponent into thinking I do not carry Fire Punch, allowing me to then see what they do and act accordingly.</p>

<p>Lum Berry helps against Darkrai leads with Focus Sash, as I can take the Dark Void and Earthquake, let Kyogre sleep and then go to Scizor to Bullet Punch. Groudon's resistance to Stealth Rock also meant I was less worried about not having Leftovers gain.</p>

<p>Maximum HP is generally beneficial defensively, and 216 Defense EVs gives Groudon a bonus stat point with an Impish nature. The Speed EVs allow me to outspeed 24 Speed Kyogre (Rest & Sleep Talk versions). It also allows me to beat minimum Speed Dialga and obviously opposing Groudon, allowing me to beat the latter to the Roar. 12 Special Defense EVs help against a threat I have unfortunately forgotten.</p>

<p>The obvious downside to Groudon is Drought. Drought really fails to benefit the team like rain does, which is quite frustrating. However, Groudon is generally used for tough scenarios as a go-to guy in matches, meaning I try to avoid switching Groudon in when possible. Kyogre also has enough bulk to switch in often and start up Drizzle. Groudon is especially helpful in taking Thunders from Kyogre, that not much of my team likes taking. </p>

<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 176 HP / 116 Atk / 216 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Roost<br />
- U-turn</p>

<p>Helping against Toxic Mewtwo is really useful, as often they are loaded up on Special Defense, which obviously causes Palkia problems. Kyogre can often beat these Mewtwo but it eats a lot of my PP due to Pressure, which is often vital when it comes to the end of a match.</p>

<p>Bullet Punch helps pick off weakened threats, and Pursuit often helps if I need to get a Choice Scarf Palkia or Mewtwo out of the way. Scizor has an important role of dealing with Deoxys-A via Bullet Punch. </p>

<p>Scizor is also vital in picking of Latias who can also be a bit annoying to the team. 204 SpA Latias's +1 Thunder boosted by Soul Dew fails to OHKO Scizor, and I can obviously play games with Bullet Punch / Pursuit / U-turn against Substitute Latias. Roost is vital as it means Scizor can often threaten a U-turn and quickly heal back up, giving me the upper hand against these threats once more. Scizor also helps against certain Giratina-O.</p>

<p>Life Orb generally is just useful. Scizor often seems to be taking more damage than it is because of Life Orb, but it gives Scizor an extra kick that it needs in the Uber metagame, while retaining its freedom.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/488.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Dialga</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Thunder<br />
- Fire Blast</p>

<p>Dialga keeps the team working, and provides more of a mid-game powerhouse than anything. Often Dialga can come in and just spam Draco Meteor to cause hurt to something at least, which is especially useful against more offensively-based teams which aren't caused as many problems by Dragon Pulse, as Draco Meteor allows me to consistently do the damage through Dialga's high Speed (courtesy of Choice Scarf).</p>

<p>Dragon Pulse is more of a "this attack needs to hit" move. It doesn't have a huge window of use, but is really useful against Swords Dance Rayquaza and Adamant Dragon Dance Rayquaza, who both threaten me without Dialga.</p>

<p>Thunder is always useful for Kyogre, as it gives me a backup plan should Ludicolo faint and I not want to bring out Palkia yet. Thunder also helps against Lugia over a longer spread of time, and paralysis often helps with this. Lugia is unable to Roost before Thunder hit's which is obviously very nice!</p>

<p>Fire Blast helps against Scizor. Scizor is thoroughly annoying to be honest, as it can give me real problems if it gets in on Ludicolo / Sleep Talk Kyogre. Dialga can Fire Blast, helping stop any Scizor predicting a Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse. </p>

<p><strong>Ludicolo</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Rain Dish<br />
EVs: 252 Hp / 40 Def / 216 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Grass Knot<br />
- Leech Seed<br />
- Protect<br />
- Substitute</p>

<p>I still don't understand why people don't use Ludicolo. I think most people who have tried it have had amazing success with Ludicolo, and it fits on so many teams it's incredible. Ludicolo is not on the team as a "gimmick", or a bit of fun. It's here to do a job, which it does do, successfully.</p>

<p>Leech Seed & Protect makes up the majority of stalling. Rain Dish is pretty amazing with Leftovers & Protect, netting me 12.5% HP back per turn in the rain, allowing me to stall with Substitute & Protect if need be. Leech Seed puts Ludicolo in a position where it is a bit like "Stallrein" on steroids. If a Pokémon has 404 HP (hi Kyogre, Manaphy, Groudon, Dialga, and Jirachi) I am gaining 50 HP per turn. If you count in Rain Dish & Leftovers, suddenly I am gaining a ton of HP which allows Ludicolo to cause devastation to teams through Protect. </p>

<p>Ludicolo can often laugh off Blissey. I can Substitute all over Toxic, and I only really fear Seismic Toss. If Blissey is effectively spamming Seismic Toss and I am unsure on whether it has Toxic or not, I can often simply just use Substitute and Protect to annoy it. If Ludicolo gets a Leech Seed on Blissey though, it's pretty fun wearing it out of Softboiled or Wish PP. It also helps as I can do the whole "Substitute + Protect until at full HP" thing.</p>

<p>Protect also helps scout Choice users which is always an advantage. </p>

<p>I have no fear switching in to Kyogre barring Choice Specs Thunders, where I can then go to Groudon and Roar / Earthquake. This is because I can then Protect, and due to Rain Dish and Leftovers Kyogre becomes less of a threat. Choice Specs Water Spout only manages 40% maximum to Ludicolo which is an insane amount of damage considering its power. I can then Leech Seed etc and start stalling. If against Choice Scarf Kyogre I will just Substitute straight away, helping if the opponent switches out. The opponent won't be able to easily set up on Ludicolo either if they switch to the likes of Swords Dance Rayquaza as I Substitute: if it Swords Dances it will lose to Substitute, Protect, & Leech Seed (provided I got the Substitute on the switch).</p>

<p>Leech Seed is also helpful for a Palkia sweep, and often gives Scizor the edge over many threats.</p>

<p>Ludicolo is also generally my first switch in to Palkia and special Dialga provided it's raining. Choice Specs Dialga does too much with Draco Meteor, though, but I can generally play around such a threat.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/382.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Kyogre</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Drizzle<br />
EVs: 240 HP / 244 Def / 24 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Surf<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>

<p>I wanted Drizzle obviously for Ludicolo, so I needed Kyogre. I also wanted a 100% good switch in to Toxic / Seismic Toss Blissey that could take it on (Scizor struggles to, as does Dialga). Rest & Sleep Talk Kyogre fits the bill perfectly, also giving me a sleep taker (screw you Darkrai). Calm Mind allows me to beat non Calm Mind Giratina, Blissey, and so on. </p>

<p>Kyogre is helpful against Choice Scarf Garchomp (Banded versions are somewhat handled by Dialga). Kyogre is often able to actually set up on the likes of Palkia (a common Kyogre switch in) because of Rest. The Defense EVs really aid me in a cause of beating Rock Polish Groudon, who is annoying. </p>

<p>There really isn't much to say about Kyogre. It does exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/489.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Palkia</strong> @ Expert Belt<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 100 HP / 156 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Hasty Nature<br />
- Focus Punch<br />
- Spacial Rend<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Thunder</p>

<p>Palkia can come in late-game on a Pokémon it can force out and use Substitute (the best move in the game). Focus Punch OHKOes Blissey meaning I don't have to worry about it if it isn't gone yet. Spacial Rend packs the bags for Giratina, and Thunder helps rampage Kyogre and Lugia. Mix Palkia is pretty useful against stall too!</p>

<p>Palkia is so good at just coming in and finishing off teams. Palkia can also act as a go-to guy against Kyogre as a last resort, and is generally what the team is about!</p>

<p>I purposely avoided Life Orb so I don't have to go down the whole "damn, 4 turns to KO 5 Pokémon :(" route.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think to many Ludicolo is probably still seen as a gimmick - the damage calculations don't particularly look nice. However, after you actually face one, or play with one, you see how horribly useful it is to carry on a team.</p>

<p>As I said I have had pretty good success with this team and I know others have. Each Pokémon has a specific role in supporting Palkia. Groudon sets up Stealth Rock and keeps many Pokémon in check, and Scizor stops bulkier Psychic-types that can take STAB Spacial Rends. Dialga takes out dangerous threats to the team mid-game that may otherwise beat me, and also outspeeds many Pokémon used to check non-Scarf Palkia. Kyogre provides rain so Ludicolo can provide Leech Seed, together having great synergy and providing problems for the opponents. Kyogre also provides the ability to take status, all together aiding Palkia's attempt to sweep. </p>

<p>When I showed Jibaku the Pokémon (not the sets) on the team he asked how I break stall. Generally it is just by trying to stop them from setting up entry hazards via giving as little free switches as possible and using the Pokémon to wear down the opponent through it, with Mix Palkia cleaning up at the end. Kyogre goes through stall without Latias / Calm Mind Giratina pretty easily (although Calm Mind Giratina still has problems), but Latias can be manhandled by Pursuit or U-turn from Scizor, depending on how I feel. Dialga exerts pressure (no pun intended) on the opponent and often lasts longest due to the hit-and-run way I play it. I also cannot emphasize enough about how I play this team. It is one relying on good switches and playing around Pokémon, often having a hidden backup plan. If the team is played while having no backup plan you will often fall to bad luck.</p>
