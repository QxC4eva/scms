<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to paralyze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Force Palm's Base Power is too low to merit competitive use on offensive Pokemon. However, the Technician ability will boost this move to 90 Base Power, making it powerful on top of the paralysis chance. As it stands, the only Pokemon that commonly makes use of the move is Hariyama, as it is Hariyama's most reliable attack without the harmful side effects of lowered defenses that comes with Close Combat, and the low accuracy of Cross Chop. Hariyama is also able to effectively capitalize on the paralysis and spread it around on the opposing team. Beyond this example, there are very few other Pokemon that are able to really make use of the move and would rather use a more powerful move such as Close Combat or Hi Jump Kick.</p>
