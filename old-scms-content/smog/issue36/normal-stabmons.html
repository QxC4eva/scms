<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>STABmons is a metagame where all Pok&eacute;mon have access to all moves that correspond to their typing. In this article, I will be talking about the Normal-type, which is arguably the most buffed type in the metagame. Powerful moves that all Normal-types gain access to include Shell Smash, Boomburst, Extreme Speed. Oh, did I mention that they can even carry all of those at the same time? Well, it's not advised, but I mean, you could if you really wanted to. Anyway, this makes for many versatile and powerful threats in the metagame. This even creates a whole playstyle revolved around Normal-types, coined 'NormalSpam'. However, do not fear, for it is not a completely unstoppable playstyle. Sableye, the most popular Pok&eacute;mon in STABmons, is a Ghost-type, and is thus immune to all Normal-type moves. What's more, it can use Topsy-Turvy to flip Shell Smash boosts, or simply use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers that attempt to set up. It can even put them to sleep with Dark Void. Basically, Normal-types win the award for most improved, but they are not necessarily completely broken. Anyway, let's take a look at the most popular Normal-type threats of the STABmons metagame!</p>

<h4>The Normal-types</h4>

<img src="http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/diggersby.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Diggersby</strong></p>
<p>Diggersby is one of the biggest threats in the entire STABmons metagame thanks to its ability, Huge Power. Huge Power makes Diggersby insanely strong anyway, but in STABmons, its power can reach new heights. One big concern with Diggersby is its Speed, which is quite lacking, however, this is all mitigated through the use of Shell Smash. Shell Smash makes its power reach soaring heights and patches up its Speed. Another popular set is Belly Drum, which abuses Extreme Speed to its fullest. At +6, Extreme Speed 2HKOes even the likes of Skarmory that resist it. Extreme Speed is also a way for Diggersby to escape its Speed issues while avoiding all +1 priority moves, such as Mach Punch or Aqua Jet. Although quite rare, Diggersby can act as a lead with a set of Spikes / Lovely Kiss / Explosion / Swords Dance. This set has a lot going on, but it truly works. Lovely Kiss cripples opposing Pok&eacute;mon by putting them to sleep, while Spikes provides team support. Explosion is so strong that at +2, it OHKOes Skarmory. The reason why Explosion is so important is because it means that Defog and Rapid Spin will fail to remove Spikes if Diggersby has already fainted. Diggersby is a powerful, versatile threat that has very few true counters and must be prepared for on any STABmons team.</p>
<br />
<img src="http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/meloetta.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Meloetta</strong></p>
<p>Meloetta is a very unique Pok&eacute;mon with very unique typing. It has an immunity to Shadow Ball, which would otherwise be super effective due to its Psychic typing. Meloetta has high stats all-around, with high Special Attack and Special Defense and a reasonable Speed stat. Meloetta can effectively pull off two powerful sets: Offensive Shell Smash and Support. Offensive Shell Smash is quite scary because Meloetta has secondary STAB that allows it access to Stored Power, a trait only shared by Espeon. Stored Power hits a scary 140 Base Power after a Shell Smash, tying with Boomburst. Speaking of Boomburst, Meloetta packs a very powerful few can stomach. Shell Smash sets often run Judgment with a Fist Plate to break down Heatran. The Support set is equally viable and takes a more defensive approach. Defensive sets capitalize on Meloetta's high Special Defense and access to Recover to wall many different Pok&eacute;mon. Pair this with Rapid Spin to remove hazards and this gives you a great team player. These sets typically carry Boomburst to stop Meloetta from being set up on, as it is quite powerful even without investment.</p>
<br />
<img src="http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/chansey.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Chansey</strong></p>
<p>Chansey is an interesting Pok&eacute;mon in STABmons. Although it doesn't have anything in terms of offense, and is often overwhelmed by the fast-paced metagame, Chansey does have one major selling point: Transform.Transform is an amazing move on Chansey; for those who don't know, Transform carries over Eviolite boosts and the user's HP stat, essentially making it a bulkier version of whatever it faces. This is great because Chansey gains all the opponent's boosts and much more bulk. Chansey can also make use of Rapid Spin thanks to Natural Cure and Wish, which, in conjunction with Rapid Spin, creates a nice pivot that can keep itself and its teammates healthy. Chansey is a bit passive, but all sweepers must be wary of setting up against this pink blob.</p>
<br />
<img src="http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/kangaskhan.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong></p>
<p>Kangaskhan doesn't appear to be much of a threat with its average stats and bulk, however, it is quite viable. Scrappy is Kangaskhan's main niche and the reason it's used in the first place. Belly Drum is insane on Kangaskhan because its Attack stat skyrockets to dangerous levels, and not even Sableye can stop it after that. Kangaskhan can run the same sets with Shell Smash instead, but Belly Drum sets often eclipse them. Another very viable set is one that utilizes the combination of Fake Out + Extreme Speed. This combination allows it to single-handedly check almost all setup sweepers by causing chip damage to their hopefully weakened HP and picking them off with Extreme Speed. Once again, Scrappy is an excellent aid to this.</p>
<br />
<img src="http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/stoutland.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Stoutland</strong></p>
<p>Stoutland is in the same boat as Kangaskhan - a Normal-type with Scrappy. One might wonder why you would use Stoutland over Kangaskhan, but they're actually quite similar. They have similar overall bulk, with Kangaskhan edging Stoutland a bit Speed; however, Stoutland has a higher Attack stat. Similar to Kangaskhan, Stoutland can also pull off a Belly Drum set with Extreme Speed, but this is not Stoutland's main niche. Stoutland focuses more on Fake Out + Extreme Speed sets, as it's arguably much better at the job than Kangaskhan. Stoutland is also very great at utilizing Rapid Spin, which is unblockable thanks to Scrappy, while also boasting better use of Recover. Both Stoutland and Kangaskhan are similar, and it's really up to you which one you like.</p>
<br />
<img src="http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/ursaring.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Ursaring</strong></p>
<p>Ursaring, once the king of STABmons, has fallen far from its throne. This generation, Ursaring is eclipsed by Diggersby by a long shot. Diggersby is more powerful, boasts greater Speed, has a secondary STAB move, and is not a ticking time bomb. Nonetheless, Ursaring can still work in the same way; it is still quite powerful with the combination of Fake Out + Extreme Speed. What Ursaring does have over Diggersby is Guts; Guts gives Ursaring a nice Attack boost and essentially, an immunity to status moves. With Sticky Web support, Facade can be used and Ursaring can launch off powerful onslaughts. Ursaring's poor bulk means it can't survive many hits, and it is not particularly fast meaning it can be picked off easily. The final nail in the coffin is its reliance on status orbs, which set its lifespan on a timer and make Ursaring faint too quickly. Despite these setbacks of the new generation, Ursaring is still a threat if unprepared for.</p>
<br />
<img src="http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/bibarel.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Bibarel</strong></p>
<p>Bibarel isn't exactly the first thing that comes to mind when you think of threats, but nonetheless, it still is one. Bibarel's ability, Simple, allows Shell Smash to provide a +4 / +4 / +4 boost at the expense of -2 / -2 to its defenses. Bibarel also has access to Extreme Speed and Water Shuriken, making it a bit difficult to handle. However, Bibarel is not invincible; it is easily stopped by bulkier Pok&eacute;mon like Quagsire, and if you can predict correctly you can avoid getting swept by it. Other interesting sets are its fully special ones, which utilize insanely strong Boomburst, Hydro Pump, and Ice Beam to get around its traditional counters. Bibarel needs to watch out for the Fake Out + Extreme Speed combination because of its poor bulk, and its lack of Speed comprises its overall effectiveness. Don't underestimate this chirpy looking beaver, despite it's cute appearance, Bibarel is a threat to prepare for.</p>
<br />
<img src="http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/ditto.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Ditto</strong></p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, Ditto is nothing more than a gay flubber, but it can be more threatening than you would think. With the amount Pok&eacute;mon that boost in the metagame, Ditto is exceptional at revenge killing practically everything, regardless of how many boosts they've accumulated. Its ability allows it to come in and instantly transform into the opposition, copying all of their boosts. This is absolutely incredible for offensive teams that are looking for a way to check setup sweepers. While Ditto doesn't do anything outside of this and is quite one-dimensional, it still does its work and is quite good at what it does. A common argument I've heard is 'Why would I use Ditto when Chansey exists?' This is a good question, and it may be hard to see why, but the answer is right there: Imposter. Chansey must take a turn to transform, but Ditto can switch in and it instantly happens. There's really no use outside of this, but the niche is still there and can be executed well.</p>
<br />
<img src="http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/pyroar.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Pyroar</strong></p>
<p>Pyroar is often overlooked when teambuilding, and it's really not hard to see why. It has average Special Attack, useless abilities, and poor bulk, not to mention that it has a Stealth Rock weakness to top it all off! However, Pyroar has a unique niche in being able to outspeed most other common Shell Smash users thanks to its high base 106 Speed. Pyroar also has a secondary typing that gives it access to the powerful Blue Flare, and Boomburst of course. Pyroar's ability, Unnerve, is quite situational, however, it can be used against Belly Drum users to prevent their Sitrus Berries from activating. Pyroar is quite an underrated and undiscovered Pok&eacute;mon, and thus, it is not often prepared for.</p>
<br />
<img src="http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/bouffalant.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Bouffalant</strong></p>
<p>Bouffalant is another Pok&eacute;mon that is often forgotten about, but it does have a legitimate niche. It's one of only two Pok&eacute;mon with both Soundproof and Perish Song, the other being Exploud, which has much better things it could be doing. This combination allows Bouffalant to force an opposing Pok&eacute;mon out without being impacted by Perish Song at all. Outside of Perish Song, Bouffalant is largely outclassed by Stoutland in almost every way; supporting moves like Recover and Rapid Spin can be used to some degree of success, but they're mainly used as fillers as Bouffalant is outclassed by almost every other Normal-type. In short, Bouffalant is a very outclassed Pok&eacute;mon unless running Soundproof + Perish Song.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>So now you've learned all about the Normal-types of the STABmons metagame! I hope this article inspires you to go out there and try to counter these Pok&eacute;mon, or even create some interesting sets that I did not mention. Don't forget, everything has an option!</p>
