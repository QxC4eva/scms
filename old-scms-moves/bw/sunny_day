<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This move generates the sunlight weather condition for five turns. Any weather condition previously on the field is removed. While Sunny Day is in play, all Fire-type moves will have their Base Power increased by 1.5x, and all Water-type moves have their power decreased by .5x. Synthesis, Moonlight, and Morning Sun will recover 2/3 of the Pokemon's maximum health. The move SolarBeam will not require a charging turn. Thunder and Hurricane have their accuracy decreased to 50%. The move Growth will raise Attack and Special Attack by two stages each instead of one. No Pokemon will obtain the freeze status while Sunny Day is active. At the end of each turn, Pokemon with the ability Dry Skin will lose 1/8 of their health. Pokemon with ability Solar Power will lose 1/8 of their health at the end of every turn, and will have their Special Attack stat boosted by 50%. Pokemon with the ability Chlorophyll have their Speed doubled. Pokemon with the ability Harvest always restore the Pokemon's consumed Berries at the end of every turn. Pokemon with the ability Leaf Guard are unaffected by status problems and cannot use the move Rest. Pokemon with the ability Flower Gift and its partner in double battles will have their Attack and Special Defense stats boosted. Pokemon with the ability Forecast transform into a Fire-type. Weather Ball becomes a Fire-type move with Base Power of 100. Cherrim changes its forme to Sunny Forme. If the user of this move holds the item Heat Rock, the duration of the weather becomes eight turns rather than five. If Sunny Day is used while the sunshine weather condition is already active, the move will fail.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sunny Day generates sunlight for five turns, and the effects of sunlight increase the power of all Fire-type moves by 50% and decrease the power of all Water-type moves by the same, giving Fire-types a rare advantage over Water-types. This means that Pokemon such as Heatran, Darmanitan, Victini, and Chandelure can fire off monstrously powerful attacks that are almost impossible to wall. Charizard also deserves special mention for its Solar Power ability, which in the sunlight turns Charizard into the stuff of nightmares for defensive teams. The sunlight also helps Grass-type Pokemon as well, as Pokemon with the Chlorophyll ability can abuse sunlight, for their Speed is doubled, allowing them to outspeed almost all unboosted Pokemon. This turns Pokemon normally quite tame Pokemon, such as Venusaur, into absolutely horrifying sweepers that can tear apart non-weather teams. Both Grass- and Fire-types also get pretty big move improvements. SolarBeam is available to both Fire-types, who can use it to counter Water-types, since it doesn't require charging on the first turn, and Grass-types, for a more powerful STAB attack. Moonlight, Synthesis, and Morning Sun can significantly restore the user's health. Furthermore, sunlight prevents the freeze status, meaning Ice Beam or Blizzard have no chance of freezing anyone in the field. However, Sunny Day will mostly be used in UU tier as in OU, Ninetales possesses the ability Drought, which permanently keeps sunlight active, and the combination of Chlorophyll with Drought is legal in OU, unlike the combination of Drizzle and Swift Swim. Unfortunately, Drought is banned in UU, so Sunny Day is your best bet there.</p>
