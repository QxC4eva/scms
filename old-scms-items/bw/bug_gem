Raises the power of a Bug-type move by 50%. One-time use.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder uses a damage-dealing Bug-type move, then the holder consumes this item and the power of that move is increased by 50%. One-time use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In single battles, Bug Gem is not typically a useful item, unfortunately. While the one-time boost to Bug-type attacks is nice, most Pokemon using Bug-type attacks would rather have the more reliable power of Life Orb or Choice items.</p>

<p>Typically Gems are more valuable in the VGC and similar environments, and Bug Gem is often used here to boost the power of Bug Bite from Scizor or Megahorn from Heracross or Escavalier. The one-time power boost can come in very useful in such a fast-paced metagame, particularly against bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Occur randomly in Dust Clouds.</p>
