[Overview]

<p>Audino often fails to distinguish herself from the other pink blobs. Thankfully, she's found a niche in the lower tiers. Despite pitiful offenses and Speed, she does provide excellent team support. A high base HP makes her one of the best Wish passers in RU; Healing Wish and access to various status moves only improves her worth. That low Speed can actually be a blessing as well, making her among the best Trick Room users around. Finally, Regenerator is a wonderful ability that allows her to heal up by switching out, meaning her Wish passing not only benefits a teammate, but herself as well.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Wish passing is what Audino does best. By using Wish and switching out, both she and her teammate will regain health thanks to her amazing ability, Regenerator. This makes her an amazing asset to any defensive team. Protect serves several purposes: it provides her with Leftovers recovery, stalls more turns for Toxic, and scouts for any surprise Fighting-type attacks. Toxic is a great move for wearing down foes, though Heal Bell can be used to relieve your team of other status, if you already have Toxic support; Thunder Wave can even be chosen to cripple faster sweepers looking to set up on Audino. Flamethrower hits Ferroseed and Rotom-C for super effective damage and prevents Audino from being total Taunt bait.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The selected EVs and nature provide maximum special bulk. Furthermore, with 252 HP EVs, Audino can pass 205 HP wishes, which is quite a plus. Leftovers is the standard item, and recovers a little bit of her health each turn. Return is an option to use over Flamethrower, and gets STAB, but fails to hit anything super effectively. Just make sure to use a Careful nature if you opt to use Return over Flamethrower.</p>

<p>The best partners for this set include walls that lack the ability to heal themselves. Sandslash can often set up or use Rapid Spin to remove hazards, and its lack of recovery makes Wish support a requirement. Hariyama, Escavalier, Ferroseed, and Steelix are other walls that lack the ability to heal themselves, though the latter two share an unfortunate Fighting weakness with Audino. Finally, offensive Pokemon who are weak to Stealth Rock, such as Moltres and Scyther, are always eager to receive Wish support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With impressive bulk and depressingly low Speed, Audino makes an excellent Trick Room user. She can consistently pass bulky Wishes to her teammates, healing herself when she switches out. When the game is drawing to a close, she can set up Trick Room and use Healing Wish, sacrificing herself to bring a slow sweeper in status-free and at full health. Flamethrower is once again included to keep Audino from being bait for Taunt, although a Taunted Audino is as good as dead anyway. Protect gives her the ability to heal herself with Wish, but Regenerator and Leftovers usually do a good enough job keeping her healthy, seeing as she won't stay in long.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Sassy nature helps to maximize special bulk while minimizing Speed, allowing Audino to outrun most threats under Trick Room. Regenerator is the ability of choice, allowing Audino to repeatedly switch in, set up Trick Room, and switch out to a sweeper. This set is only intended for Trick Room based teams, meaning slow, yet powerful Pokemon, such as Marowak and Rampardos, make ideal partners. Furthermore, Audino's Fighting-type weakness can be patched up with Ghost- and Psychic-type Trick Room users. Thankfully, they are plentiful. Dusknoir, Uxie, Beheeyem, Mesprit, and Slowking are all superb teammates for Audino.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Light Screen
move 2: Reflect
move 3: Wish / Thunder Wave
move 4: Flamethrower / Return
item: Light Clay
ability: Regenerator
nature: Calm / Careful
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With access to both Light Screen and Reflect, Audino can take on the role of a dual screener. Wish passing is always a solid option for Audino, and her teammates will enjoy an extra helping of health with their boosted defenses. Thunder Wave is a great choice; with it, she can paralyze something on the switch, allowing her to outspeed and set up the appropriate screen before they hit her. Flamethrower and Return are options to prevent Audino from being complete Taunt bait.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Light Clay is the obvious item choice, as it increases the duration of Audino's screens. Regenerator usually does an adequate job of keeping her healthy, making Leftovers an unnecessary supplement. You can also use Healing Wish in this set, giving her the ability to completely heal an incoming sweeper at the cost of her own life. The EVs and nature provide maximum special bulk, though her nature depends on your attack of choice.</p>

<p>Offensive Pokemon that need added bulk (or don't have the Speed to outrun key threats without paralysis support) make great partners. Sawsbuck, Medicham, and Feraligatr all love screen support; it gives them the opportunity to set up without worrying about an effortless revenge kill. Slower Pokemon such as Aggron, Crawdaunt, and Hariyama appreciate having their foes slowed down, and the added bulk from dual screens never hurts. This Audino is meant to act as the glue that keeps offensive teams together; pair her up with powerful sweepers and she won't let you down.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Encore helps to derail any sweeper using Audino as setup fodder, but space in her moveslots tends to be limited as it is. A set utilizing dual screens and Trick Room can go a long way towards assisting Trick Room teams, but Healing Wish and Wish are usually better options. Yawn can force switches or spread sleep, especially alongside Protect, but Toxic or Heal Bell are usually better options for the Wish set, and Audino has trouble finding room for Yawn on any other set. Amnesia can be used to boost her Special Defense to absurd levels, but she has very little use for the additional special bulk. Finally, a RestTalk set is a possibility for added recovery, but with no offensive presence, she'll find herself being Taunt bait, setup bait, or both.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The best way to counter Audino is with Taunt. If she can't provide team support, she fails to be useful in any way. Powerful Fighting-types run rampant in RU, and all of them threaten her with super effective STAB moves. Hariyama, Gallade, Hitmonlee, and Medicham can easily bring her down. The likes of Ferroseed and Sandslash don't mind making use of her presence to support their own teams, though the former must be wary of Flamethrower. Most sweepers can also set up in her face and threaten her out; however, she can cripple them with Thunder Wave or Toxic.</p>
