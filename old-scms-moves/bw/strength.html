<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Has an in-game effect that enables you to move big boulders.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Just like Cut, this move should not be your first choice on a competitive team. A lot of moves outclass Strength, and should be considered before it. Once more, there is no real reason to not use Return or Frustration in that slot since they have considerably more power.</p>
