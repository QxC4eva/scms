Moves
========
- Follow Me allows Togekiss to support its team by effortlessly redirecting Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-type moves
- Air Slash is Togekiss's best STAB, as the move can work superbly with serene grace by stopping Trick Room users and dealing good neutral damage overall
- Tailwind allows Togekiss to offer its team a form of speed control, as it is greatly appreciated for slower threats such as landorus-t
- Thunder Wave is another form of speed control, but it's more specific in that it aims itself at one target, but unlike tailwind, the effects are much more crippling and long-lasting
- Roost allows Togekiss to heal itself so that it can better spam follow me
- Protect dissuades and removes the threat of double-targeting
- Helping Hand, however, can be quite useful be giving its teammates' moves an extra kick, pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan in particular will greatly appreciate the 50% attack boost
- Dazzling Gleam can work as an effective STAB and spread move
- Flamethrower works well in taking out scizor and other steel-types
- Encore is a nice disruption tactic for Fake Out users and possibly set up sweepers
- Safeguard helps remove the threat of status for Togekiss and its teammates

Set Details
========
Can use Lum Berry to better deal with status
Defense evs allow it to survive LO Bisharp's Iron Head, allowing it to redirect the move at least once
Speed EVs are used to outpseed minimum speed Rotom-W
Sitrus Berry is used to that Togekiss can instantly recover a good chunk of health and be better prepared to spam Follow Meag

Usage Tips
========
- Togekiss may be brought at nearly any stage of the match and be effective
- If, however, you choose to bring Togekiss mid-game, it's better to bring it out as unscathed as possible by utilizing a volt switch or u-turn users such as rotom-w or landorus-t, that way, Togekiss will be better equipped to utilize follow me
- Togekiss may also be brought in the place of dragon-type so it can sponge the draco meteor and get in safely just the same
- When Togekiss is up against pokemon that commonly use spread moves, such as zard y, it's better to not use follow me, but instead attack or utilize another support move, as spread moves will make Togekiss' follow me support down-right counterproductive
- Should your opponent wise up to Togekiss's follow me shenanigans and instead choose to double-target Togekiss to take it out, then that's the perfect time to use protect to stop this counter-measure
- Similarly, roost may be used when Togekiss is up against weaker attackers with the intent to double-target it, pokemon such as Cresselia and Hitmontop will barely scratch Togekiss, so taking advantage of that opportunity and using roost can be quite beneficial
- Oftentimes, it's good for Togekiss to attack so that it can take advantage of Air Slash's flinch rate; this flinch rate can come in handy by potentially stopping Trick Room users in their tracks

Team Options
========
- Togekiss works best at redirecting Fighting, Dark, and Dragon-type moves, as well as crippling status, so any Pokemon that likes those moves out of their way and synergizes well with Togekiss makes for a good partner
- Garchomp is one pokemon, as it loves Togekiss's ability to remove the threat of Dragon moves; in return, it can demolish most steel-types with Earthquake
- Mega Kangaskhan, Bisharp, and Terrakion appreciate Togekiss's ability to sponge Fighting-type moves and redirect Will-o-Wisp; of the three, Bisharp is quite useful for its ability to take out Mega Gengar, which is quite the thorn in Togekiss's side
- Wide Guard Aegislash also makes a good partner, as it can stop spread moves, whereas Togekiss can tank Dark-type moves and cripple spread move users with Thunder Wave or set up Tailwind to help remedy Aegislash's low speed
- Rotom-W also makes a good partner, as it can deal with the Steel-types that Togekiss detests, such as Scizor and Heatran, while Togekiss can sponge Grass moves from Shaymin-S and help Rotom-W deal with Dragon-types
- Gyarados also works as a nice partner by providing Intimidate support and easily handling most Steel-types; Togekiss can aid Gyarados by keeping away the threat of status and redirect weaker Electric-type moves with Follow Me
- Lastly, Breloom also works as a decent partner, as it can destroy Terriakion and Tyranitar while Togekiss uses Follow Me to tank Flying-type moves and allow Breloom to spam Spore more easily

Other Options
########
- Alternate moves: Dazzling Gleam, Flamethrower, Encore, Safeguard
- Safety Goggles + Follow Me

Checks & Counters

**Offensive Type Advantage**:

- Steel-types such as Heatran, Mawile, Jirachi, Bisharp, Excadrill, Aegislash, Scizor, and Genesect
- Electric-types such as the Thundurus formes, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Rotom-C, and Manectric
- Electric-type moves such as Kyurem-B's Fusion Bolt
- Stone Edge from Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Tyranitar can be very effective in limiting the amount of times Togekiss can spam Follow Me
- Ice-types such as Mega Abomasnow, Mamoswine, and the Kyurem formes
- Mega Gengar

**Miscellaneous**

Spread moves can make its support useless, if not downright counterproductive
