[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Plus grants a 50% Special Attack boost in double or triple battles if on the field with a partner using Plus or <a href="/bw/abilities/minus">Minus</a>. This boost will not stack if there are multiple Pokemon with Plus or Minus on the field.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Plus could have been a good ability in doubles if there were better Pokemon with it. <a href="/bw/pokemon/klinklang">Klinklang</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/plusle">Plusle</a> are horrible users, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/ampharos">Ampharos</a> is not much better. Here's to hoping for better Plus Pokemon in Generation VI.</p>
