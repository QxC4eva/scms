<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Swift has a small niche as specially based Ambipom's and Persian's only good Normal-type STAB. Both these Pokemon possess Technician, which powers Swift up to a hearty 90 Base Power before STAB, and compensates for their low base Special Attack. Beyond that use, however, Swift is best ignored for some other coverage option or Tri Attack when available.</p>
