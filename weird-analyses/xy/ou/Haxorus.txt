Overview
########
In a tier rife with Dragons of all shapes and sizes Haxorus maintains several boast worthy traits over his dragon brethren. He maintains the highest non-legendary Attack stat, surpassed only by Kyurem-B and Mega Garchomp, neither of which have access to the coveted Dragon Dance. His pure Dragon typing, being oddly uncommon, makes him far less likely to fall susceptible to non-STAB Ice attacks that are often carried for the likes of Dragonite and Garchomp. Furthermore his relatively rare ability, Mold Breaker, allows him to disregard pokemon with otherwise problematic abilities like Levitate Rotom-W, Filter Mega Aggron, Unaware Clefable, numerous Sturdy users and Multiscale Dragonite. There are some things that make this battle axe worse for wears though. His overall lack of bulk means he's easily 2HKO by many strong neutral hits and potentially vulnerable in his required set up time. New Fairy types will also make you hesitate to click that Outrage button, meaning it isn't just the ubiquitous Steel type you need to worry about anymore. While he has enough coverage options to handle most Steel and Fairy types, you can't cover everything and can find yourself hard walled without the right team support. 97 Speed is acceptable for wall breaking and sufficient with enough boosts to clean sweep with an unresisted Outrage. Haxorus has the right stats, ability, moves and typing to perform his role very very well.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Outrage / Dual Chop
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Poison Jab
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Lum Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 64 Def / 200 Spe

Moves
========
Dragon Dance is your boosting move of choice giving you the power and speed you need to rip through weakened walls and slower sweepers. Earthquake is great for handling Steels like Aegeslash, Heatran and Klefki and can even finish off any max/max Rotom-W with roughly 80% HP remaining. Poison Jab is necessary to hit Togekiss and a viable means of taking out Azumarill and Clefable; where Mold Breaker helps by negating Unaware iterations. For wallbreaking or sweeping, Outrage will benefit you the most with its insane power, but Double Chop is always there as an option if you are more conservative and has the unique ability to dissipate Substitutes with multiple strikes. You will likely however find yourself more outraged than Haxorus in the long run with its insufficient power.

Set Details
========
Lum Berry is an often necessary security blanket that will preserve Haxorus' rampage potential by allowing him to boost in the face of status users. It can also cure confusion from Outrage as a fail-safe, so it always provides you some benefit. Your speed surpasses max base 90s, including Lucario before it Megavolves at +0, providing a very good chance to OHKO with Earthquake. 64 Df provides just enough bulk to always avoid death from CB Talonflame Brave Bird at full health with Stealth Rock. This requires little sacrifice from your speed and the extra bulk can really help. Scarf Landorus-T can outspeed you at +1, but considering you need +2 to beat him safely anyway it is of little consequence. Max Attack is of course there to hit as hard as a battle axe should.

Usage Tips
========
Haxorus requires safe opportunities to boost to overpower sturdy walls and bypass faster and frailer threats. Getting two Dragon Dances is your goal and is often enough to shift the odds in your favor against many would-be checks and counters. A weakened team with its Steels and Fairies eradicated simply can not stand up to his mighty Outrage. Don't try to switch Haxorus into anything, you want to try to come in as safely as possible to not waste your berry and preserve as much HP against any lingering priority or scarf users. Use the Lum Berry to your advantage and boost in front of Rotom-W and the like that would normally rely on burning or paralyzing you, providing you the free turns you need. A slow Volt Change or U-Turn are reliable methods of getting Haxorus in unscathed against unwilling foes. Haxorus' natural speed can still be useful in the interim with his Earthquake and Poison Jab good for finishing off guaranteed slower pokemon like Excadrill, Heatran and physically frail Fairies.

Team Options
========
Most Steels protect Haxorus from all three of his weaknesses. Heatran's plethora of resistances (4x resists Fairy and Ice) and great bulk make him a reliable team player with Fire STAB for other Steels. Mega Aggron is also very bulky and with Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail good for slowing down the competition. Any U-Turn or Volt Change user that scouts for you can help get Haxorus in for free against an unwilling opponent allowing for more boosting opportunities. Rotom-W is a popular choice easy to fit onto most teams and is a good answer for Talonflame, Scizor, Balloon Heatran and Landorus-T, slows down important enemies with Thunder Wave, and can Volt Change scout. Rotom-H similarly handles Talonflame but is also great against many Steels like Scizor, Skarmory, Genesect and Ferrothorn, handily resisting their common moves and threatening a OHKO with Overheat. Being immune Burn on top of Paralysis like Rotom-W is also beneficial. While not weak to Spikes or Stealth Rock directly, Poison Spikes can rid you of your crucial Lum Berry prematurely, so a strong Poison pokemon like Mega Venusaur, or immune Rapid Spinner like Excadrill are handy in getting rid of them. Scolipede absorbs Poison Spikes and is a great Baton Passer. Scizor is also great for Defog to get rid of hazards, handy resistances as well as slowly U-Turning Haxorus in. A Klefki of your own protects you from opposing Dragon, Fairy and Ice attacks and can use Thunder Wave and set dual screens for Haxorus to more reliably boost behind.

Other Options
########
A relatively fast Taunt can give a Jolly Haxorus even more opportunities to boost, but you'll be severely lacking in coverage. It could be potentially worth it though since you can Taunt status users and phazers allowing you to use Life Orb or Leftovers as an item instead. Dragon Claw can be used over Dual Chop for the more reliable accuracy. Swords Dance is insanely powerful, but Haxorus struggles due to lacking good defenses, having no priority and not enough base speed. Choice Band provides immediate power and a faster means of wallbreaking, but all common moves have immunities and would require Adamant to benefit the most from the power to be effective. Choice Scarf is also an option but eclipsed by Garchomp having base speed of 102 and STAB Earthquake. Low Kick is your best means against Ferrothorn and can OHKO Mamoswine and Mega Gyarados at +1, and can kill Heatran that carry Balloon. Rock Slide is a fair choice on Choice Scarf sets able to hit many of the faster 4x weak pokes like Charizard Y, Talonflame and Volcarona with potential for flinching.

Checks & Counters
#########
Skarmory either resists or is immune to anything you can throw at it and can easily Whirlwind you away or Toxic stall you. Choice Band Superpower can't even 2HKO. Taunt at the very least can shut down most Skarmory allowing you to boost to more threatening levels. You can not outspeed or OHKO scarf Genesect unless at +2, otherwise you are KO'd by his Ice Beam. Yache Berry can potentially help you get to +2 in this particular circumstance but its an encounter best avoided altogether. Togekiss is immune to Outrage and Earthquake, but can never outspeed your Poison Jab, even Adamant versions. +1 Poison Jab always OHKOs Azumarill after Stealth Rock, and +0 can OHKO Belly Drum Azumarill without Sitrus Berry. +6 Splash Plate Aqua Jet is still a 2HKO even with rocks. +2 Poison Jab is still not a guaranteed OHKO on max/max Bold Clefable, who has a 19% chance to OHKO with Moonblast without rocks, so you need to have sufficiently boosted to stay in on Clefable. Faster Dragons, particularly scarfed versions of Hydreigon, Latios, Kyurem-B and Garchomp easily threaten you with Draco Meteor or Outrage even after +1. Haban Berry can not protect you from these powerful Dragon moves. Choice Band Scizor, Mega Lucario, Adamant Mamoswine and Talonflame have the only priority attacks capable of dealing more than 50% damage to your health, so try to eliminate them before sweeping. Gyarados checks with Intimidate and can either Paralyze or use a super effective Dragontail. Landorus-T likewise has Intimidate and a very strong Earthquake but will always lose if he switches in on a Dragon Dance, allowing you to boost to +2 for the secure win. Standard Ferrothorn can paralyze you or hurt you badly with Gyro Ball after boosting speed and can always Leech Seed/Protect stall on top of Iron Barb+Rocky Helmet damage.
