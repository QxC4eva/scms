<p>I would like to welcome everyone to the World Cup of Pokémon V. Signups and team formation are already underway, and this year the competition appears to be stiffer than ever, with over <strong>430</strong> people registering for the tournament, up from the 308 users who signed up last year. I would like to wish good luck to all teams during this team formation process and I look forward to a great tournament.</p>
