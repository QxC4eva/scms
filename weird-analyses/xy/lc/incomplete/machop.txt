Moves

Machop gets STAB from DynamicPunch

Set Details
========
Choice Scarf makes Machop hit the 21 Speed
Most moves gives Machop a lot of coverage
EV's give Machop it's max. attack and makes it hit the 14 Speed
Usage Tips
========
Switch it when a Psychic or Flying type comes in, even when it has a weakness against you
Knock Off is the best early in-game move, since it gets rid of Eviolite
Keep in mind that DynamicPunch only has 8 PP
Use the most powerful coverage moves that Machop has
Can switch into resisted attacks
Predicting in combination with coverage moves really comes in handy (Like the opponent switches into Swirlix while you go for Poison Jab)
Team Options
========
Any bulky steel types, such as Magnemite and Shieldon resists Machop weakness and can switch into those attacks
Slow U-Turn/Volt-Switch users such as Magnemite, Vullaby and Clauncher gives Machop a safe switch
Pokémon like Spritzee can use Wish to heal Machop
A Dark type like Vullaby can come in handy when it comes to Psychic or Ghost Pokémon, especially if it has Pursuit to trap them.

Other Options
########
Choice Band can deal more damage to opponent, but prevents Machop being quick
Bulky set to run in Trick Room
Bulk Up boosts Defense and Attack making Machop hit harder
Berry Juice heals Machop because it has no good recovery
Bullet Punch can be used for priority, although it lacks power
Guts can be used to stop burn from beating Machop, but gets outclassed by Timburr which has access to Drain + Mach Punch
Substitute + Encore or Substitute + 3 Attacks abuses confusion
All non-ghost Pokémon can be haxed to death with DynamicPunch, which makes Scarfchop viable
Knock Off deals with Ghost Types and Eviolites
Checks & Counters
########
Machop can't do anything against bulky types like Misdreavus, Koffing and Larvesta with Will-O-Wisp, Slowpoke with Psychic, Gligar with Acrobatics, and Spritzee with Moonblast
Burn and Paralysis while Machop has No Guard really screws it up
Quick, physical attackers with an advantage can easily wear Machop down, like Swirlix with Unburden
Substitute stallers can get rid of the almighty DynamicPunch
