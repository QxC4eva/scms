Overview
########
One of the two new fossil Pokemon, never-before-seen dual typing
This Pokemon is very good against Flying-types in general, walling their STAB and also having super effective dual-STAB against them
Refrigerate ability makes all Normal-type moves into Ice-type moves and also grants a 1.3x boost, practically a Life Orb boost with no recoil on a turn where the boost applies
Snow Warning is illegal on it as of now
Rock/Ice typing is awesome offensively but totally horrible defensively; it has a ton of weaknesses and even a 4x weakness to Steel and Fighting
Priority attacks destroy it
This mon must be played with care in order to shine with its strong points, and it is not the liability to teams it appears to be if used properly; you kinda have to REALLY know what you're doing with it or you're going to think it sucks

Moves
========
Nature Power, the main attack, turns into Tri Attack this generation and is especially unique on Amaura because of Refrigerate giving it Ice-typing and practically a Life Orb boost, which totals at 156 Base Power if you include STAB... very powerful and also has a nice 20% chance to burn/freeze/paralyze
Ancient Power is the obligatory second STAB move that has awesome coverage alongside Nature Power, particularly against Fire-types
Thunderbolt can work to nail the Water-types that resist Nature Power and also provide a third super effective attack against Flying, making none of them safe... mostly a filler move
Dark Pulse can be used to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gastly and Gothita... mostly a filler move
Hyper Beam is an extreme option that adds up to be a 292 Base Power Ice-type attack that obliterates almost any important threat late-game after Amaura has already put in work; it is a kamikaze but can be worth it when you need to take down an important threat quickly
It's a shame it doesn't get Freeze Dry like Aurorus, its evolution
Set Details
========
With the given Speed investment and Choice Scarf, Amaura hits 21 Speed, enough to outspeed everything in the game under normal conditions
Modest nature is recommended here to make Amaura the most potent specially offensive threat possible, and Amaura still has all the Speed it needs
The minimal EVs in defenses are enough to raise them each by a point despite the huge investment in Speed and Special Attack
Amaura has naturally high HP and thus less necessity for investing there (hits 24 HP with no investment)
Usage Tips
========
Amaura isn't that frail but it doesn't have Eviolite on the set and DOES have a lot of weaknesses (Grass, Water, Ground, Rock, Steel 4x, Fighting 4x), so it must be played with utmost care and not allowed to take super effective hits
Amaura is weak to a ton of priority moves including Aqua Jet and is especially weak to Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, and Vacuum Wave, avoid these at all costs
Never ever switch Amaura in unless you are 100% sure it will be coming in on a resist; Amaura really shines vs Flying-types but is also resistant to Normal, Poison, and Ice
Amaura does poorly against Steel-types and should have teammates that can deal with these as well as the problems mentioned above
STAB Ice/Rock coverage is incredible offensively and puts some serious hurt (clean OHKO) on popular top-tier threats such as Gligar, Fletchling, and Murkrow, while also obliterating anti-meta threats such as Growlithe, Vullaby, Natu, and Archen
Hyper Beam is the panic button; use it only if you absolutely need it... even if you can't kill your active enemy with any of your moves, don't use it if you may need it later, switch out instead... it is acceptable to use this attack against something like Berry Juice/Unburden Swirlix to get by it without having to put up with its bullshit; if you use Hyper Beam you will die next turn unless your opponent's an idiot, so be very reserved with your use of it; having 21 Speed and a 292 BP attack is a huge blessing that obliterates just about every neutral target in the game from full health even with Eviolite and can turn entire games around if used at the right moment; after you get rid of the big threat, you then have switch advantage after they kill you off, so you get to keep momentum ^_^
Team Options
========
Amaura ABSOLUTELY NEEDS team support, cushions to fall back on reliably
Physically defensive Slowpoke is the best partner Amaura can possibly have, as it soaks up all the priority attacks that Amaura is weak to, and also walls the two types that Amaura is 4x weak against
Honedge cushions Amaura's weak points comfortably and can take advantage by setting up with Swords Dance or Autotomize after switching in, though it does share a Ground weakness with Amaura (but Amaura can deal with Ground-types with its Ice STAB rather easily so it shouldn't have to switch out of those)
Pawniard is a huge problem for Amaura both offensively and defensively so any bulky Fighting-type at decent health (and preferably a priority Fighting-type attack) can be an awesome teammate: mons that come to mind are Impish Eviolite Mienfoo, Special Croagunk, and Timburr
Any teammate that can remove hazards (particularly Stealth Rock) is greatly appreciated by Amaura and helps with its longevity
Other Options
########
A bulky set with Thunder Wave can be used as a Flying-type counter, and this is especially good for countering Murkrow, as Amaura resists Flying and Nature Power causes Sucker Punch to fail, being a status move that converts into an attacking move; however, Amaura's awful typing renders this kind of set useless against most everything else in the metagame
Rock Polish can work well but most Steel-types will either kill Amaura or force it out, so Thunder Wave is generally a better option for a lasting Speed advantage over opponents
Amaura has access to tons of support moves, including dual screens, Calm Mind, Encore, Haze, Psych Up, and Safeguard, but it doesn't have the typing to be able to effectively use any of these in most situations
Amaura can go physical with a set that include Return, Rock Slide, and Bulldoze, but its special offense is more reliable and generally better to use in the tier
Mirror Coat is kind of gimmicky but Amaura does have access to it
Checks & Counters
########
Steel-types are the bane of Amaura's existence; Pawniard, Bronzor, Ferroseed, Honedge, even Aron all give it hell, easily knocking Amaura out in one hit while it's STABs are walled and so it can't do much to them
Timburr, Special Croagunk, Meditite, Carvanha, anything with a super priority attack (especially Steel- or Fighting-type) can quite easily check Amaura with the threat of a OHKO or pretty damn close to one if Amaura has full health with Eviolite; this is especially a problem against the Scarf set, as priority overrides Amaura's boosted Speed
Specially defensive Chinchou is the one bulky Water-type that walls Nature Power and isn't hit for super effective damage by Thunderbolt, and can hit back hard with a super effective Water-type move
Munchlax with Thick Fat and Earthquake could get around Amaura quite easily
Other Scarfers such as Gligar and Chinchou obviously give the Choice Scarf set trouble, as they both outspeed and hit it hard with a super effective STAB move
