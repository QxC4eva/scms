<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Restores the HP of the holder by 25% of its max HP when at 50% HP or less. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Psychic-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sitrus Berry, the in-game story trainer's favorite item, is somewhat less favored by competitive battlers. While Sitrus Berry does indeed grant a significant HP boost, it is only equivalent to four turns of Leftovers recovery, so defensive Pokemon will typically opt for the more conventional recovery item, as they are likely to get a lot more healing out of it over the course of a battle, especially as it does not have an activation cost and cannot be used up.</p>

<p>However, in faster-paced metagames where battles are shorter and thus Leftovers healing is not advisable, Sitrus Berry becomes far more worthwhile. Although it is outclassed by Oran Berry in Little Cup, it is a useful item in VGC, although Item Clause means it is restricted to one Pokemon per team. The extra healing can help in a pinch, and easily prevent your Pokemon from going down in two hits, if you're lucky.</p>
