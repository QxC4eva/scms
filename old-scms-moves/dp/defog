[SHORT DESC]
Lowers target's evasion 1 stage. Removes various field effects.

[LONG DESC]
<p>This move lowers the target's evasion one stage. Furthermore, it removes Reflect, Light Screen, Safeguard, and Mist set up by the target's team, and it removes Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes on the target's side of the field (when your Pokemon uses an entry hazard, it is set on your opponent's side of the field). This means that targeting the enemy with Defog will remove any spikes laid by the user of Defog, but targeting the user's partner will remove any spikes set up by the enemy. The target's Mist prevents Defog's evasion reduction before being removed.</p>

<p>Removes the Fog weather condition, which in a competitive setting only ever occurs in the Courtyard Colosseum on PBR and Battle Arcade in the Battle Frontier.</p>

<p><strong>Overworld effect:</strong> Clears deep fog from an area to allow for better visibility.</p>
