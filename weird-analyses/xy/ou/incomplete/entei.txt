########

    Got Sacred Fire with the transition to XY
    Sacred Fire has 50% Burn Chance and 100 BP which can cripple its normal counters such as Garchomp
    Good Base 115 Attack and 100 Speed allows it to use this move well
    Pretty bulky too and resistance to Fairy-type is good type
    Access to Extremespeed lets it smoke fast threats and makes it a good revenge-killer
    Rain nerf makes Sacred Fire a better move now
    Stealth Rock weak :(, but buff to Defog makes it a somewhat lesser issue
    Fire-typing gives it common weakness to Ground-, Water-, and Rock-type
    Poor coverage moves
        The "Volcano Pokemon" lacks Earthquake and also relies on Stone Miss for coverage
    Remains a powerful threat if you play to its advantages


Choice Band
########

name: Choice Band
move 1: Sacred Fire
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Bulldoze
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

    Sacred Fire is main STAB move and hits ridiculously hard with Choice Band and its burn chance gives it a way to cripple its switch-ins such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, Garchomp, Salamence, Tyrantrum, and Azumarill. MANDATORY
    Extremespeed + Choice Band is a great revenge-killing tool
    Stone Edge hits hard and provides a way to kill Talonflame, Noivern, Salamence, and hit Rotom-W for some solid damage on the switch
    Bulldoze is used for Heatran as it OHKOes after Stealth Rock (iirc with CB, not Assault Vest) and Aggron before it has Mega Evolved, but has limited usage outside of that

Set Details
========

    A Choice Band set needs max Atk and Spe
    Adamant Nature because Extremespeed requires
    You can use Life Orb, but it doesn't complement its bulk, but it can easily pick off switch-ins with the combination of Sacred Fire + Extremespeed

Usage Tips
========

    Sacred Fire should be used a soon as it gets a chance
    Sticky Web Galavantula has good synergy with this thing and it can slow down targets for it to kill like
    It can run a mixed CB set utilizing Overheat as its Special Move to do massive damage to Mega Aggron for example
    Extreme Speed late-game when everything is weakened
    removing ghost-types is good so Extremespeed doesn't become a liability

Team Options
========

    Deoxys-S makes hazards for easy Extremespeed abuse and Entei forces lots of switches, so the hazards help
    Choice Scarf Genesect can give Entei plenty of switch-ins with U-turn and eliminates faster threats that might not have got burned or just want to nuke with Special attack
    Calm Mind Latias appreciates the physical attackers burned
    Mega Charizard Y provides Sun Support for it to send off stronger Sacred Fires
    Blissey walls like everything if you burn the physical attackers on your opponent's team
    Thundurus-I can paralyze faster threats and can switch into Earthquakes aimed at Entei
    spinners such as Excadrill and Mega Blastoise are good teammates, latios has good synergy with entei and can defog away troublesome hazards

Other Options
########

    AV set can be used as a great mixed Tank, but the damage output is rather disappointing and it is worn down easily, but it is a solid option to be considered on bulkier teams.
    Extrasensory and Eruption, yea, too lazy, crappy movepool
    Entei should not a use a Special set

Checks and Counters
########

    Heatran can come in easily, but needs to watch out for Bulldoze
    Many of its Checks are crippled by Burn, but powerful Special Attackers such as Choice Specs Latios can do massive damage even through the Assault Vest
    Stealth Rock will weaken it, same with Spikes, this thing will switch a lot
    Rotom-W, Greninja, and Mega Blastoise force it out easily
    Rain (nerf sucks but Sacred Fire and Flare Blitz won't hit hard as they were)
    CM Clefable and Reuniclus can set-up on the AV set and don't mind burn thanks to Magic Guard
    Moltres can roost pressure stall out sacred fire
    Sacred Fire has a measly 8 PP, so pressure from the likes of Deoxys-D and stalling using Flash Fire can drain its PP out fast
    Lum Berry Dragonite can come in easily and takes very little and kill a weakened Entei with Outrage
    Infernape and Charizard X are immune to Burn
    Entei has trouble breaking past Rotom-H as well
    paralysis can ruin it as its speed helps outpace some of the threats that can do massive damage to it such as Mamoswine + Hydreigon
