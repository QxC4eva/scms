Doubles all status boosts and drops.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All stat changes applied to the wielder are doubled. Set boosts (such as those received by <a href="/bw/moves/baton_pass">Baton Pass</a> or copied via <a href="/bw/moves/psych_up">Psych Up</a>) are not doubled. Pokemon with Simple are still limited to a maximum of 6 boosts to any given stat.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>No Pokemon that are decent in OU these days have Simple, so while it is a fantastic ability, no Pokemon can take advantage of it. Furthermore, it does not double the effects of existing stat boosts, so your dreams of Baton Passing a single <a href="/bw/moves/tail_glow">Tail Glow</a> to <a href="/bw/pokemon/bibarel">Bibarel</a> and sweeping are just a fantasy.</p>
