Can infatuate Pokemon of opposite gender when struck.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When a Pokemon of the opposite gender connects with a contact move against the wielder, there is a 30% chance of it becoming infatuated. Cute Charm has a separate chance of activation on each hit of a contact multi-hit move, and can status a Pokemon multiple times if the first status is removed by the effect of <a href="/bw/items/mental_herb">Mental Herb</a>.</p>

<p>When the wielder is first in the party, wild Pokemon have an increased chance of being of the opposite gender.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Cute Charm is unreliable, but it certainly has its uses. Having an opponent struck by a timely bout of infatuation can turn the game around. So why isn't Cute Charm seen more often? Well, most Pokemon that get Cute Charm have a better ability on hand, such as <a href="/bw/abilities/magic_guard">Magic Guard</a> for <a href="/bw/pokemon/clefable">Clefable</a>, <a href="/bw/abilities/frisk">Frisk</a> for <a href="/bw/pokemon/wigglytuff">Wigglytuff</a>, or <a href="/bw/abilities/klutz">Klutz</a> for <a href="/bw/pokemon/lopunny">Lopunny</a>. Cute Charm should be tossed aside for a better ability unless there are no other options or legality issues.</p>
