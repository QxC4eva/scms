[Overview]

<p>Out of all the BW Pokemon introduced, Beheeyem is certainly one of the most interesting in regards to the competitive Pokemon metagame, as it appears to be built for double and triple battles rather than singles ones. With a movepool filled with support moves, such as Ally Switch, dual screens, Trick Room, and the rare Wonder Room, as well as the abilities Synchronize and Telepathy, one would assume that it doesn't have much worth in a singles match. Furthermore, Beheeyem has a horrible Speed stat as well as mediocre HP and Defense stats, and its mono Psychic typing is known for lacking useful resistances and possessing devastating weaknesses to Pursuit and Sucker Punch.</p>

<p>However, Beheeyem has a number of tricks up its sleeve that make it viable in singles matches. Beheeyem has a massive base 125 Special Attack stat, making it one of the most powerful special attackers in the NU tier. Additionally, the BW2 releases gave Beheeyem a godsend in its Dream World Ability, Analytic, which powers up Beheeyem's attacks if it moves after the opponent, which is likely considering Beheeyem's Speed. Factoring in this boost, Beheeyem can actually hit harder than even the famed Deoxys-A, a feat that is not to be ignored. Beheeyem also has a small but adequate offensive movepool that can be used to devastate the opponent's walls. Finally, Beheeyem can support its teammates and also turn its low Speed into its advantage through Trick Room, which can also be used in conjunction with Nasty Plot in order to become an offensive behemoth that few Pokemon can effectively deal with. While Beheeyem appears to be out of its league in singles matches, it is not to be underestimated, for it can destroy the opponent with proper support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When given Choice Specs, Beheeyem becomes one of the most powerful special attackers in the NU tier, capable of obliterating the opponent. Giving it a Life Orb also makes it quite powerful, but is noticeably weaker against threats like Regirock. Psychic is Beheeyem's main attacking move, hitting even most special walls hard, especially after an Analytic boost. Thunderbolt is a great coverage move alongside Psychic, as it hits Water-types hard while also hitting a lot of NU for neutral damage. Signal Beam allows Beheeyem to annihilate Pokemon such as Exeggutor and Gardevoir who would otherwise have an easy time switching into it. Hidden Power Ground is Beheeyem's answer to Pokemon such as Klang, Probopass, and Skuntank, who could otherwise switch into it with ease. However, as Life Orb is an option on this set, Recover can be used over Signal Beam to make up for Life Orb's HP cost. Do note that this makes Beheeyem more vulnerable to Psychic-types, who can take any other attack once and put Beheeyem down with Crunch or Pursuit.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If running Choice Specs, another option for the moveset is to replace one of the moves, preferably Signal Beam, with Trick in order to cripple special walls that might switch in. However, losing its item makes Beheeyem less powerful, and it would much rather plow through the opponent than cripple them.</p>

<p>While powerful, Beheeyem must contend with a number of Pokemon that can stop it in its tracks. Despite Hidden Power Ground, Skuntank can switch into a predicted Psychic and threaten with Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Additionally, dedicated special walls, such as Lickilicky and Altaria, can switch into Beheeyem, tank its hits, and phaze it out. Dual screens support from Ampharos or Rotom-S is a great option, as it allows Beheeyem to take more hits, which in turn allows it to dish out more damage. Also, both Ampharos and Rotom-S have access to Volt Switch, giving Beheeyem the opportunity to switch in safely. Gurdurr and other Fighting-types are good partners to Beheeyem, as they can take out Steel- and Dark-types while also luring in Psychic-type attacks for Beheeyem to switch into. Electabuzz also appreciates Beheeyem's ability to break down special walls, and it can utilize Volt Switch to provide a safe switch-in for Beheeyem. Despite also being a great check, Skuntank makes a great partner, as they can eliminate opposing Psychic-types easily, allowing Beheeyem to more freely let loose with Psychic.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Inevitably, Beheeyem will face comparisons to Exeggutor and other Psychic-types, but Beheeyem has another surprise in store: Nasty Plot. With Nasty Plot and Analytic boosts in conjunction with Beheeyem's sky-high base 125 Special Attack stat, few Pokemon, if any, will be able to stand in Beheeyem's path. Psychic is once again Beheeyem's main attacking move, as a +2 Analytic-boosted STAB Psychic will utterly destroy anything that opposes it unless they are bulky and resist it. Signal Beam punishes any Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon that decide to switch into Beheeyem such as Liepard and Exeggutor. Thunderbolt can be used over Signal Beam to provide greater neutral coverage against the NU tier, though this comes at the cost of struggling against other Psychic- and Dark-types. Finally, Hidden Power Ground demolishes Pokemon such as Probopass and Skuntank that would otherwise wall Beheeyem. Recover is also an option, as Beheeyem appreciates being able to recover HP lost due to opponents and Life Orb. However, this means that Beheeyem will struggle against the aforementioned Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There is a choice of item to consider when using Nasty Plot Beheeyem. Life Orb is the main option, as it allows Beheeyem to hit harder, particularly against special walls. However, Leftovers is also an option, as the recovery gives Beheeyem a longer lifespan, particularly if it doesn't run Recover. Dual screen support is important to this set, as Beheeyem will be staying in longer in order to obtain a sweep. Ampharos and Rotom-S are prime candidates, as they can set up both Reflect and Light Screen before potentially providing a safe switch-in with Volt Switch. Despite Beheeyem's great coverage, Dark- and Steel-types threaten Beheeyem's sweep since many of them are faster and can cripple it, so Pokemon that can get rid of them are suggested. One excellent teammate is Gurdurr, who can set up easily and demolish Beheeyem's counters. In exchange, Gurdurr also lures in Psychic-type moves for Beheeyem to switch into.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One of Beheeyem's major setbacks is its horrible Speed stat, which allows it to be defeated easily by faster attackers. However, Beheeyem has Trick Room, allowing it to turn the tables on its opponents. In addition, Beheeyem can use Nasty Plot to boost its Special Attack stat to sky-high levels, making it a hard-hitting monstrosity to face while under Trick Room conditions. Psychic is the obvious choice for a main attacking move, as a +2 STAB Psychic severely hurts any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. The last moveslot is up to the choice of the user. Signal Beam is the main option to demolish opposing Psychic-types, who would otherwise wall or threaten Beheeyem. Thunderbolt is another option, as it has great coverage alongside Psychic and can take out a number of opponents. Finally, if Probopass and Skuntank are too problematic, Beheeyem can run Hidden Power Ground in order to have an answer for them. However, Signal Beam and Thunderbolt are usually better options since they provide otherwise better coverage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Dual screen support is even more important than usual for this set, as Beheeyem must spend two turns setting up, giving opponents multiple opportunities to freely attack it. Unfortunately, the limited coverage of this set means that Steel- and Dark-types have an easier time dealing with Beheeyem. An example of such is Probopass, as it can wear down Beheeyem and burn out Trick Room turns while resisting Psychic and Signal Beam. To counter these threats, Torterra is a great teammate, as it appreciates Trick Room support and can easily take down Dark- and Steel-types. Guts Ursaring also loves Trick Room, and in addition it can demolish most of Beheeyem's common counters such as Musharna and Lickilicky.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Although Beheeyem has a multitude of options that are better left for doubles and triples battles, Beheeyem does have a number of choices that also work for singles battles. For example, Substitute can be used to protect Beheeyem from Sucker Punch while also giving Beheeyem some breathing room, allowing it to take out more opponents through its coverage moves and high Special Attack stat. Shadow Ball is also an option to hit Ghost-types such as Golurk and Misdreavus, but it otherwise has redundant coverage. A Trick Room set by itself is viable, but this is usually outclassed by Pokemon such as Duosion, who has more bulk and doesn't need to worry about status. Pain Split can help Beheeyem recover HP while decreasing the opponent's, but Recover is almost always a better option due to its consistency. A Calm Mind set is possible, although Beheeyem has Nasty Plot to set up faster, and a Calm Mind set is usually outclassed by Gardevoir, who has better bulk. Beheeyem also has access to the rare Wonder Room, which switches Defense and Special Defense, allowing Beheeyem to take down special walls that would otherwise stop it cold. However, this is a very gimmicky move, and it shouldn't be used competitively; besides, Beheeyem would much rather attack the opponent. Finally, Rain Dance and dual screens are options for supporting teammates, but these are usually done better by other Pokemon, such as Volbeat, and again, Beheeyem would rather spend its turns attacking the opponent.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>It is actually fairly hard to describe a true counter to Beheeyem, as no Pokemon can effectively switch into Beheeyem 100% of the time. The closest thing to a counter would be special walls such as Lickilicky and Altaria, who can take a hit and phaze Beheeyem out. Probopass is also a good choice to switch in against Beheeyem, as its Rock / Steel typing and high Special Defense allows it to take on most of Beheeyem's attacks. However, it must be wary of Hidden Power Ground, which will easily destroy it. Mandibuzz can switch into any of Beheeyem's moves barring Thunderbolt and cripple it with Toxic or prevent Trick Room with Taunt. The best way to defeat Beheeyem, though, is to revenge kill it. Skuntank is the best option in this regard, as it can smack Beheeyem with STAB Sucker Punch while threatening with Pursuit should Beheeyem decide to switch out. Golurk is also a decent choice, as it can threaten it with Shadow Punch coming off of its great Attack stat. Kangaskhan can also take on Beheeyem due to its good Attack stat and access to Sucker Punch and Fake Out. Although it is not common, Zweilous can switch into any attack bar Signal Beam and phaze Beheeyem out or threaten it with Crunch.</p>
