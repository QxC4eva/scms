Set
#############
name: A [ORAS] Primal Kyogre
item: Blue Orb
ability: Primordial Sea
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest
move 1: Origin Pulse
move 2: Thunder
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Water Spout / Hidden Power Ground / Calm Mind

Just an all out attacking set. Water Spout for the most damage early game, but Hidden Power Ground does the most to Primal Groudon switch-ins, nabbing a 2HKO on max HP Primal Groudon. Just hope you don't run into a Specially Defensive one. Also if you want some more firepower, you can use Calm Mind. Especially helpful with paralysis support. Also you could probably get away with max HP over max Speed for more bulk.
