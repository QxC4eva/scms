Overview
########

- Access to a 180 Base Power STAB move in V-create.
- Victory Star allows it to use high powered but inaccurate moves, of which it has many (Bolt Strike, Blue Flare, Focus Blast, etc), much more effectively.
- Versatile movepool and stat distribution allows it to go either physical or special.
- Access to powerful electric attacks allow it to easily neutralize bulky waters that plague other Fire-types.
- Defog makes it easier to keep hazards (especially rocks) off your side of the field, allowing many more switch in opportunities than before.
- V-create's side effects make it incredibly vulnerable to revenge killing, especially Pursuit trapping.
- Awful defensive typing leaves it weak to many common types, including Water, Rock, Ground, Dark, and Ghost.
- Speed tier of 100 is an awkward middle ground that leaves it outsped by many threats.


Wallbreaker
########
Name: Wallbreaker
move 1: V-create
move 2: Bolt Strike
move 3: Brick Break
move 4: U-turn
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

Moves
========

- V-Create has absurd power with STAB + Choice Band.
- Bolt Strike hits the bulky Water-types that resist Fire, 2HKOing 248/244 Slowbro, and has 93% accuracy with Victory Star.
- Brick Break hits the Rock-types that resist Fire, OHKOing 252/0 Tyranitar and 2HKOing 252/0 Heatran.
- U-turn allows Victini to scout its potential switch-ins while maintaining momentum, and deals respectable damage to those scouts in the process.
- Trick is an option to cripple walls if you deem your Band unnecessary, but someone of Victini's counters, especially the bulky Rock-types, do not mind a Choice Band.

Set Details
========

- Max Attack and Speed maximize offensive potential. 
- Choice Band maximizes power. Life Orb can be used to switch moves, but with V-create's drops you won't typically have the chance to switch moves anyway.
- Adamant gives more power; Jolly secures at least a Speed tie with other max 100s. However, Victini forces switches, making adamant the superior choice.

Usage Tips
========

- U-turn is very useful early game to scout your opponent's response to Victini.
- Know your opponent's team; don't go spamming V-create against a team with Pursuit users.
- Play hit and run and avoid getting hit whenever possible; 100 defenses can't make up for one of the worst defensive typings in pokemon.
- Keep hazards off the field, as Victini loses a quarter of its health every time it switches into Stealth Rock.

Team Options
========

- Anything that can clear hazards, as well as Pokemon that can set them. Like many Choice Pokemon, Victini will be switching in and out quite a bit, making its Stealth Rock weakness much more noticeable. If you can get sticky web support, then Victini can usually use V-Create a second time before switching out.
- Mega Blastoise carrying Ice Beam can take of the Dragon-types that like to switch into Victini, and can deal with Rock-types + Heatran with Aura Sphere. It can also Rapid Spin away the hazards Victini hates.
- Dugtrio is able to trap Heatran and Tyranitar, two of the more common switch ins to Victini. It also takes care of weakened Politoed.
- Ferrothorn and Skarmory can take almost all of the physical attacks aimed at Victini, while setting up hazards of their own. Skarmory can also Defog hazards if that becomes a problem.
- Vaporeon can deter the use of Water-type attacks against Victini and use Wish to heal Victini in return.
- Bulky Pokemon that you can switch into repeatedly after use of V-create.

Other Options
########

- A special set can be used.
- Victini can take advantage of the V-create Speed drop to run an effective Trick Room set. 
- Victini gets Final Gambit, and with 404 HP with maximum investment, will almost always knock out something else.
- Will-O-Wisp can ruin some of Victini's normal checks, but it has a hard time fitting into a moveset.
- Victini is part Psychic-type, but none of its Psychic STAB moves hit particularly hard.
- Victini can use a Choice Scarf to decent effect, and a Scarf allows it to use V-create twice against things that would normally outspeed it.
- Substitute can be used to ease prediction, but between Substitute and its vulnerability to hazards, this set gets worn down very quickly.
- A mixed set is feasible, but usually outdamaged by a maximum invested V-create.
- Sunny Day can work on non-Choice sets to be more self-sustainable or help should Ninetales go down, but it has to give up a valuable coverage move for this.


Checks & Counters
########

- **Dragon-types**: Dragonite, Garchomp, Latias, and Latios can all handle it to some degree due to their powerful STABs and Fire resistance.

- **Rock-types**: Tyranitar, Rhyperior, and other Rock-types can sponge V-creates well.

- **Pursuit**: Tyranitar in particular makes spamming V-create difficult. Bisharp, though unable to switch in, can also put pressure on it. 

- **Residual damage**: With a Stealth Rock weakness, vulnerability to Spikes, and potentially Toxic, Victini can prove easy to wear down if you play well.
