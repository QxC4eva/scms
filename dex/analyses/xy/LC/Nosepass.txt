Overview
########

One of the famed SturdyJuice entry hazard setters of LC, Nosepass has certainly taken its spot as the weirdest of them, being modeled after both a compass and a nose. Matching that strange design, Nosepass has access to a wide variety of moves such as Volt Switch that other setters don't have access to. Nosepass boasts a base 135 Defense stat, the second highest in the metagame. However, Nosepass is arguably outclassed by that same Pokemon that its Defense comes second to, Onix. Nosepass, despite its incredible movepool, has very weak offensive capabilities. It lacks the capacity to really deal any significant damage against most of the tier. As such, Nosepass takes on its role as a capable Stealth Rock setter with the ability to cripple its opponents with Thunder Wave and pivot out with Volt Switch.

Utility
########
name: Utility
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Thunder Wave
move 3: Volt Switch
move 4: Power Gem / Rock Blast
ability: Sturdy
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Def / 76 SpA / 196 SpD
nature: Bold / Relaxed

Moves
========

Stealth Rock can really shut down enemy teams by breaking Sturdy on some Pokemon, while also discouraging the opponent from constantly switching in and out. Thunder Wave should be used if the opponent tries to set up while Nosepass is setting up Stealth Rock. Use Volt Switch for a slow switch out, which can help get Nosepass out so that it can assist later in the game, and can help get other Pokemon in safely. Rock Blast is a STAB move that hits Flying-types pretty hard. This is extremely useful for switching in to Fletchling and then punishing it if the opponent decides to keep it in, for breaking Sturdy on other entry hazard setters, and breaking Focus Sash on Pokemon such as Surskit. Dazzling Gleam can be used to damage Fighting-type switch-ins, specifically Scraggy, who takes 4x super effective damage from the move. For most other Fighting-types, Thunder Wave and Volt Switch is a better combination, as it allows Nosepass to cripple them and get a slow switch out.

Set Details
========

The EVs that Nosepass should be running are different depending upon which move it's using. Defense and Special Defense should be maximized in order to increase survivability. The remaining EVs are placed according to the moves run; the EVs should be put into Attack if using Rock Blast or into Special Attack if using Power Gem. A Bold nature boosts Defense at the expense of Attack, so it should be run if Nosepass is using Power Gem. Alternately, a Relaxed nature increases Defense at the expense of Speed, as the slower Nosepass is, the better chance it has of moving last with Volt Switch. This works best with an EV spread of 76 Atk / 236 Def / 196 SpD. Sturdy and Berry Juice work in conjunction to ensure Nosepass has at least a turn to set up. With it, Nosepass can make several moves before going down or switching out.

Usage Tips
========

Get in, get Stealth Rock or maybe a Thunder Wave off, and serve as a suicide switch. Nosepass can tank physical hits pretty well because of its massive Defense stat and is an effective check to many common threats. Sometimes, it's more important to make a offensive move than set up Stealth Rock. Pay attention to the enemy's team and be careful with the decision that you make. While Thunder Wave can really obstruct Fighting-types like Mienfoo, it can be unwise to use if the enemy has a Timburr or Scraggy, due to Guts and Shed Skin, respectively. Use Volt Switch to get the slower switch out, giving you the switch advantage on the following turn. However, Volt Switch deals almost no damage, so don't depend on it too much. Its sole purpose is to get Nosepass out and another Pokemon in safely. Nosepass is especially useful to have around when there is a Fletchling on the other team, as it can take anything but a Hidden Power Grass variant, which is rare. If there is an opposing Fletchling, keep Nosepass around to switch into it and deal with it.

Team Options
========

Cottonee, as a switch-in for Timburr, is extremely useful. Switch into a Drain Punch, use Encore on the Drain Punch, then fight back with STAB Fairy-type moves. Pokemon that sweep better after assistance from entry hazards, such as Taillow and Fletchling, are also good teammates for Nosepass. Ghost-type Pokemon can stop Rapid Spin users from removing Stealth Rock. Pawniard, as well as some other less notable Pokemon, discourage the use of Defog on the enemy team because of Defiant, their ability. Pokemon that appreciate a slow Volt Switch in, such as Fletchling, work well with Nosepass. Pokemon that can switch into Water-type attacks, such as Foongus or Dry Skin Croagunk, also are good partners for Nosepass. Foongus also has great synergy with Nosepass, handling each other's threats.

Other Options
########

One of Nosepass's defining characteristics is its incredible movepool. It has Earthquake, Rock Slide, and several other good physically attacking moves, like the elemental punches. Of these punches, Fire Punch is the best, as it helps get past Ferroseed. One of the better sets it can run is a Pain Split Eviolite set. With such high defenses and such low HP, a Pain Split from Nosepass can truly be a problem for many opposing Pokemon. There are many odd moves and odd strategies that don't go well in a viable set but are still interesting, like Toxic, Stone Edge, Magic Coat, Magnet Rise, and Explosion, as well as Rock Polish and other boosting moves, all of which can be run.



Checks & Counters
########

**Fast Taunt users**: Mienfoo can get off a fast Taunt, stopping Nosepass completely and forcing a switch. However, Nosepass can predict this and go directly for a Volt Switch.

**Defog and Rapid Spin users**: Pokemon that can remove Stealth Rock completely defeat the purpose of setting them, and Nosepass's turn setting them up ends up being a waste of time.

**Fighting-types**: As most Fighting-type Pokemon carry Knock Off anyway, they can break Sturdy and remove Berry Juice in one turn, then Drain Punch or High Jump Kick the next.

**Water-types and Grass-types**: Both of these Pokemon take neutral damage from Stealth Rock and almost all of the moves that Nosepass has access to. Slowpoke, in particular, walls Nosepass, taking very little damage even from Volt Switch.

**Mold Breaker**: Mold Breaker users such as Axew and Drilbur really couldn't care less about Sturdy. A Superpower or Earthquake, respectively, will tear Nosepass apart before it can even move.
