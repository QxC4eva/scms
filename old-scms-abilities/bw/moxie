Boosts Attack by one stage if the wielder knocks out another Pokemon.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Moxie grants the wielder a one stage boost to Attack whenever the wielder KOes another Pokemon (including allies in multi battles). The defending Pokemon must be knocked out from the wielder's attack, not from an ally's attack. Weather effects and status conditions do not trigger Moxie. <a href="/bw/abilities/mummy">Mummy</a>'s effect takes precedence over Moxie, meaning that the wielder will not receive an Attack boost for KOing a Pokemon with Mummy with a contact move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The list of Pokemon that obtain this ability is frightening, given that it includes such powerful forces as <a href="/bw/pokemon/scrafty">Scrafty</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/krookodile">Krookodile</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/salamence">Salamence</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/heracross">Heracross</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/gyarados">Gyarados</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/honchkrow">Honchkrow</a>. All are powerful attackers capable of serious abuse of this ability. By holding a <a href="/bw/items/choice_scarf">Choice Scarf</a>, Pokemon such as Salamence, Heracross, and Krookodile can get stronger after they revenge kill a Pokemon, creating a snowball effect that allows them to power through other Pokemon on the opponent's team and work excellently as a cleaner. Scrafty is also a good user of Moxie; <a href="/bw/moves/dragon_dance">Dragon Dance</a> combined with decent stats and excellent coverage with its STAB moves transforms Scrafty into an enormously powerful sweeper if it gets going. Nearly all of the Pokemon mentioned above also have other, very powerful abilities, but Moxie is more than worth consideration alongside them.</p>
