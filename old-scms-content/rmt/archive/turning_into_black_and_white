<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I have had this team for quite a while now and have finally decided to post it. Despite Stall being dead in RU during the Nidoqueen era, variations of this team peaked #1 in the last 2 Nidoqueen stages as well as the beginning of the current testing process after Queen moved up. Props to blarajan because he always helped me with this team and used it in the RU open (which he won). I wanted to use this in SPL but always decided against it at the last second. This team has churned out countless 200+ stall wars. If there is no way for me to beat something besides stalling it out, i will stall it out. The team has a grand total of 8 attacks (not counting Rapid Spin), 2 wishers, all forms of entry hazards, a ghost and a spinner so yeah i'd definitely consider it stall (and one of the most dedicated stall teams I have ever seen in RU for that matter).</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/208.png" alt="" />
<strong>Steelix</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
IVs: 0 Spe<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Roar<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Gyro Ball</p>

<p>Steelix is a pretty essential stall staple. Steelix prevents me from getting destroyed by the likes of Choice Band Escavalier and Aggron, which I had considerable problems with on some earlier versions where i used Stealth Rock Protect Regirock. Steelix is one of the most consistent Stealth Rockers in the tier, being able to survive almost ANY physical hit and set up Stealth Rock. He's also a boss at phazing those annoying Substitute Calm Mind Uxies, since a boosted Psyshock does like 8%  Dual wish passing makes Steelix even better because it never fucking dies. Steelix is generally my dedicated lead because most of the time i'm able to easily get Stealth Rock up while taking under 50% and the other times I can just switch out to a hard counter (if something like Moltres leads). Sturdy can come in handy vs stuff like Shell Smash Omastar and Choice Specs Typhlosion that can be big pains in the ass with no Toxic Spikes down. </p>

<strong>Alomomola</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
IVs: 0 Atk<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Scald<br />
- Wish<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>Easily the heart (eheheh) and soul of this team. There are very few physical threats that Alomomola cannot wall in RU. This is my answer to Feraligatr, Entei, Emboar, Druddigon, Pinsir, and pretty much any other physical threat that you can name. I decided to try Alomomola on stall after losing to a Wish Protect Toxic Alomomola because my Choice Band Druddigon Outrage was failing to 2HKO it and I have never once thought of replacing it since. I personally believe that Alomomola functions much better than Poliwrath on stall, especially considering I have Steelix to phaze and can beat Crawdaunt between Toxic Spikes and Roselia. Another reason that Alomomola is so good is Regenerator + Wish + Massive HP. This means that Alo is able to come into many physical attacks with impunity, set up a Wish and pass it to a team mate and still be at 100% thanks to Regenerator. Alomomola is the primary Wisher for my dual Wisher core and has been on the team for quite some time now. Scald is chosen over Waterfall because I really love the burn chance against Durant (who is annoying) and the added chance to burn Escavalier is quite lovely. Most of the times it doesnt interfere (ie: burning something i want to Toxic) since any form of secondary damage is alright with me. This walls OTR Slowking (and pretty much any Slowking variant) quite easily, especially with a Heal Beller in the wings incase i take on status in the process. </p>

<strong>Cryogonal</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 168 Def / 92 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
IVs: 0 Atk<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Haze<br />
- Recover<br />
- Rapid Spin</p>

<p>To be completely honest i kinda really hate this pokemon but i need a Rapid Spinner that doesn't suck and to be quite frank Sandslash is even worse and Kabutops is redundant and doesn't really fit. I guess its cool that Cryogonal matches up pretty well against Hail teams, being able to take Blizzards from Glaceon and co and being one of my only shots at beating Sub Split Rotom-fridge. After Nidoqueen moved up I took my EVs out of Speed and tossed them into Special Defense because even the smallest difference in SpD can be the difference between me beating Lilligant or losing to it. I was running Toxic on this over Haze but i think its definitely more important for me to beat last mon Calm Minders like Tomb. Speaking of Spiritomb thats what the Defense EVs are for. With Toxic Spikes down I can easily stall out any non Rest Spiritomb variants and just come in later and spin on something slower, even if it means getting KOed because honestly besides spinning Cryo doesn't really do too much for me. </p>

<strong>Roselia</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
IVs: 2 Atk / 30 SpA / 30 Spe<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Toxic Spikes<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Spikes</p>

<p>One of the 2 pokemon that has been a staple on this team since its creation. The set however has changed a lot. With Nidoqueen gone, I am free to run Toxic Spikes. I personally believe that Toxic Spikes are incredible in RU, and have helped me win many games. The more common Poison-types in the tier such as Amoongus and Qwilfish are both fodder for setting up 3 layers of normal Spikes so i dont see that as too much of a problem. Physical Defense Roselia may seem odd for this team at first, but it works well. It helps prevent me from getting smacked by DD Crawdaunt as i mentioned previously (this lives +1 Crunch 100% of the time and usually after SR) and also means I can Spike in front of Fighting-types if i really want to without having to worry too much. You may think I am crazy for choosing to forego Natural Cure Rest, but with 2 Wishers i find it kinda redundant. HP Fire stops Durant from trying to set up in front of me and also lets me pick off weakened Escavalier.</p>

<strong>Spiritomb</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
IVs: 0 Atk<br />
- Foul Play<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>

<p>Shamelessly ripped this set from SilentVerse and have never looked back since. Foul Play Spiritomb is excellent for countering stat boosters such as Gallade that could be otherwise troublesome. My main problem with Spiritomb before switching to this set was that my only way of harming things was generally Will-O-Wisp, attacks like Shadow Sneak and Pursuit are so weak that its almost pointless to use them. Foul Play on the other hand OHKOs CB Entei after Stealth Rock and does hefty amounts of damage to Druddigon and OHKOs most anything trying to boost in my face. So as i mentioned previously i had Restalk Rotom on this team at one point with enough speed to beat Kabutops. This was cool for spinblocking vs stuff like Sandslash + tops if predicted correctly but still struggled vs Cryo. Eventually i came to the conclusion that it is much better to be able to 100% spinblock vs defensive teams that use Cryogonal than it is vs offensive teams with Kabutops. Generally offensive teams wont last as long and keeping Spikes and Stealth Rock down just expedites the process. For defensive teams on the other hand, i absolutely NEED to keep spikes and stealth rock down to keep an advantage and eventually wins, however long it may take. Spiritomb is the closest thing you will find to 100% spinblocking Cryo, Will-O-Wisp + Stealth Rock + Foul Play + Pressure is almost always enough to keep it from spinning. Pressure in general is really useful for outstalling stuff (CP Sigilyph ladder noobs stand no chance)</p>

<strong>Clefable</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Magic Guard<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 SpD / 8 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
IVs: 0 Atk<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Wish<br />
- Protect<br />
- Heal Bell</p>

<p>The last pokemon that I added after having a lot of random stuff in this slot (Musharna, Lunatone, Lickilicky, Protect Slowking to name a few). Although I really missed Licki at times (especially vs Lilligant ;__;) this makes me overall less weak to Spike-stacking teams thanks to Magic Guard and being able to pass Wishes pretty easily. Its also nice to have a Heal Beller that doesn't care about getting Toxiced by Sub Roost Moltres. Speaking of Sub Roost Moltres my way of beating it is to outstall Flamethrower PP with Clefable + Spiritomb and then get Steelix in to phaze it out. Its a pretty ghetto way of doing it but i've had to do it many times... Fable is definitely the most replaceable member of this team but at the same time it ties together a LOT of loose ends and so far to me seems to be the best choice.</p>
