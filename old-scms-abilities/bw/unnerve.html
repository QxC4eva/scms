Prevents the foe from consuming its held Berry item.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prevents the opponent from consuming a held Berry while the wielder is on the field. Moves that involve such items (such as <a href="/bw/moves/bug_bite">Bug Bite</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/pluck">Pluck</a>) will work normally. An activation notification will be given when the wielder enters battle.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Every Pokemon that has access to this ability has a better option. Unnerve in itself is somewhat useless, as the only Berries that realistically see use are <a href="/bw/items/lum_berry">Lum</a>, <a href="/bw/items/chesto_berry">Chesto</a>, and type-resist Berries, and Unnerve doesn't really do much to help win against Pokemon that would otherwise carry such Berries. It could be useful against stat-boosting Berries such as <a href="/bw/items/petaya_berry">Petaya</a> and <a href="/bw/items/salac_berry">Salac</a>, but these are even more rare than the above. Even so, with powerful Berries such as <a href="/bw/items/custap_berry">Custap</a> released, Unnerve can see some useâ€”and indeed, Unnerve <a href="/bw/pokemon/mewtwo">Mewtwo</a> can actually turn out to be quite effective.</p>
