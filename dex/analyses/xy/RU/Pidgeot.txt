Overview
########

Pidgeot is one of the best Pokemon in the RU metagame, and that's for a number of reasons. First of all, its already-decent Speed is improved upon after Mega Evolving, reaching a staggering base 121 Speed, alongside an incredible base 135 Special Attack. Sadly, the Speed still leaves it slower than Jolteon and Mega Sceptile, although it outspeeds regular Sceptile. To complement its high Special Attack, Pidgeot has access to Hurricane, which is a strong STAB move that can never miss due to Mega Pidgeot's ability, No Guard, while also having a neat 30% chance to confuse targets, allowing Pidgeot to occasionally muscle its way through walls. It also learns Heat Wave, which is a good coverage move, as well as Roost for recovery and U-turn for momentum. Sadly, Pidgeot is walled by Rock-types, especially Rhyperior, unless it has Hidden Power Grass, which requires it to give up U-turn. Additionally, it's weak to Stealth Rock, and even when it has Heat Wave, it struggles to bypass some defensive Steel-types in the tier, most notably Registeel and Bronzong, the former of which can cripple it with Thunder Wave and the latter of which does around 80% to it with Gyro Ball. Also, because of No Guard, attacks from opposing Pokemon will never miss Mega Pidgeot.

Moves
========

Hurricane is necessary, as it is one of the reasons why Mega Pidgeot is good. It's a strong STAB move with a 30% chance of confusion that can never miss thanks to No Guard. Heat Wave is a good coverage move that can hit Steel-types super effectively. U-turn is good for momentum and can let Mega Pidgeot escape from some of its counters, but Hidden Power Grass gets a 2HKO on Rhyperior, which is common and would otherwise counter Mega Pidgeot. Roost allows Pidgeot to recover its HP, and its side effect of removing Pidgeot's Flying typing for the turn can come in handy against Volt Switch users.

Set Details
========

The EVs are fairly standard, providing Mega Pidgeot with maximum Special Attack and Speed. A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs are necessary to outspeed Pokemon such as Dugtrio and Sceptile before Pidgeot Mega Evolves. Pidgeotite is the only item that should ever be considered because without its Mega Evolution, Pidgeot is not viable in RU.

Usage Tips
========

Using Pidgeot is fairly simple. Bring it after a Pokemon on your team faints or against a foe that regular Pidgeot can outspeed, then Mega Evolve and spam Hurricane unless the situation calls for another move to be used. For example, when the opponent has a Steel-type or you predict a switch to a counter such as Eelektross or Slowking, you might want to use Heat Wave or U-turn, respectively. If you're using Hidden Power Grass, then sometimes predicting an incoming Rhyperior can be crucial, as Pidgeot can easily 2HKO it. Use Roost whenever you feel like you have an opportunity to do so, such as when Pidgeot is against a Pokemon like Alomomola (assuming you predict a Protect or don't mind being poisoned by Toxic) or Aromatisse.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard setters are appreciated given that Mega Pidgeot forces quite a few switches, and it can make use of them along with U-turn to wear down the opponent's checks to Pidgeot. Therefore, Cobalion, Rhyperior, and Bronzong are good teammates because they can set up Stealth Rock. Accelgor and Qwilfish can set up Spikes, while Dragalge can set up Toxic Spikes while helping soften up Steel-types for Mega Pidgeot to break through with Heat Wave. Likewise, entry hazard control is nice, considering Pidgeot's weakness to Stealth Rock, although Defog can mean removing your own entry hazards, which isn't always optimal. Gligar is good as a Defogger and Hitmonlee as a spinner. Skuntank gets a notable mention because it can clear entry hazards with Defog and trap Slowking and Bronzong with Pursuit.

A teammate that can handle the Electric-types, namely Jolteon, Eelektross, Lanturn, and to an extent, Rotom-C, that Pidgeot struggles with is much appreciated; Dragalge is excellent, as it can switch into all four Pokemon without much trouble, though it won't enjoy a Knock Off from Eelektross. If you chose to run U-turn on Pidgeot, then other teammates with U-turn and Volt Switch are great to form a VoltTurn core aimed at luring and weakening shared checks and counters such as Rhyperior and Registeel. Such Pokemon include Eelektross, Jolteon, Meloetta, Rotom-C, and Cobalion. Powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Band Tyrantrum, Choice Specs Meloetta, Dragalge, and Pangoro go well with Pidgeot, as they can break what Pidgeot can't, while Pidgeot can handle more offensively oriented teams thanks to its Speed. Finally, Houndoom can trap Bronzong and Slowking with Pursuit or hit them hard with Crunch while threatening both Bronzong and Registeel with Fire Blast.

Other Options
########

Work Up can work in tandem with Refresh, but Pidgeot has little opportunity to set up and relies on Hurricane's limited coverage. It also doesn't help to beat any of Pidgeot's counters. Defog can be used over U-turn, but Pidgeot is better off attacking and its weakness to Stealth Rock doesn't help it. A Substitute + Toxic set is usable, but Moltres is better at using such a set due to an arguably better typing and more bulk. Finally, Toxic by itself over U-turn can help wear down Pidgeot's counters, but Pidgeot is better off U-turning out of them anyway.

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Assault Vest Eelektross is one of the best counters to Pidgeot, as it doesn't take much from Hurricane and Heat Wave, and it has super effective STAB moves to take out Pidgeot. Jolteon is a solid check, as it can switch into Hurricane twice, but it is a lot easier to wear down than Eelektross because of its lackluster bulk. Lanturn resists both Hurricane and Heat Wave and doesn't take that much damage from Hidden Power Grass while also having access to Volt Switch to gain momentum.

**Rock-types**: If Pidgeot is lacking Hidden Power Grass, Rock-types such as Rhyperior can easily switch in and take advantage of Pidgeot by either setting up Stealth Rock, KOing it with Rock Blast, or forcing it out. Tyrantrum takes a large chunk of damage from Hurricane, but it can set up a Rock Polish or force Pidgeot out.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Rotom-C outspeeds Pidgeot and can grab momentum with Volt Switch or KO with Thunderbolt. Braviary can do a lot of damage with Brave Bird, and so can Moltres with Fire Blast, which can't miss due to No Guard. Scarf Meloetta can tank a Hurricane and 2HKO Pidgeot with one of its STAB moves. Choice Scarf Hitmonlee can KO Pidgeot with High Jump Kick without the risk of missing thanks to No Guard.

**Bulky Attackers**: Pokemon that can tank a hit and retaliate hard can help check or counter Pidgeot; these include Slowking with Assault Vest, Druddigon, Choice Specs Meloetta, and Dragalge. However, most of these Pokemon, excluding Slowking, usually cannot directly switch in.

**Residual Damage/Status**: Damage from Toxic, burns, and Stealth Rock can really hinder Pidgeot, forcing it to use Roost and give the opponent a free turn. Additionally, Pidgeot absolutely despises paralysis, as the Speed drop renders it nearly useless.
