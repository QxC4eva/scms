<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder is immune to all moves based on sound. This comprises all of the following:</p>

</ul>

<p>Pokemon with Soundproof in the party are still cured by Heal Bell's effect, however.</p>

<p>If a Pokemon that has a Perish Count uses <a href="/bw/moves/baton_pass">Baton Pass</a> to a Soundproof Pokemon, that effect is passed on.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Soundproof has next to no competitive use, it has to be said. All the Pokemon who have this ability have better abilities or are just too bad to make an impact in the standard tier these days. <a href="/bw/pokemon/mr_mime">Mr. Mime</a> will probably use it over its other abilities, but really you never see it very often.</p>
