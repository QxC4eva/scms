SET NAME
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Rock Slide
move 2: Roost
move 3: U-Turn / Earthquake / Knock Off / Roar
move 4: Stealth Rock / Defog
ability: Defeatist
item: Eviolite
evs: 236 HP / 100 Atk / 76 Def / 76 SDef
nature: Impish

Moves
========

-Rock Slide is main STAB, hitting everything it needs to
-Roost is necessary for obvious reasons, keeps out of defeatist
-U-turn is fantastic for momentum
-EQ hits incoming Mag/Pawn
-Knock Off is Knock Off, pro move.
-ROARCHEN beats Torchic, and other boosters. (SD, baton pass gligar)
-Rocks are rocks
-Defog is Defog
-If Rocks and Defog aren't needed, it's cool to be able to put a slot from move 3 there.

Set Details
========

-EVs: max HP is helpful for mixed bulk, allowing it to take on both Gligar and mixkrow
-Eviolite is obvious.

Usage Tips
========

-Just Bulky pivot really... comes in to set up rocks/remove rocks and wall shit it's meant to wall.
-strong attacking stat means its still pretty threatening
-typing + eviolite + roost makes it the best flying type wall ever - murkrow and fletchling are particular strong threats it can handle.

Team Options
========

-something to take steel, water and electric-types.
-Chinchou takes on Mag, chinchou, staryu
-fighters can take on pawniard who is a pain, especially with defog
-Munchlax can take Ice moves and other sp. atks.
-Foongus and other grass types takes on water types, whilst ARchen takes on flying, fire and bug types


SET NAME
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Stone Edge
move 2: Acrobatics
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: U-turn / Knock Off
ability: Defeatist
item: Berry Juice
evs: 76 HP / 180 Atk / 196 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

-Just hard hitting stuff. Acro is cool after BJ
-Stone Edge is powerful STAB
-EQ hits steel type switch ins
-Uturn is preferred for momentum
-Knock Off is just cool in general.
-Rock Slide can be used if the accuracy bothers you since ACro is already the main STAB but power is usually better.

Set Details
========

-Max/Max.
-20 Atk is hella powerful
-Jolly outspeeds 16 speeders like Pawniard, non-jolly mienfoo, non-timid chinchou which is useful.
-Berry Juice means it can get an extra life after defeatist.

Usage Tips
========

-Come in and spam STABs/Uturn basically
-Doesn't like to switch in as much especially after Berry Juice is gone - must be kept out of defeatist range at all costs.
-can beat some stuff that it doesn't usually with EQ - such as chinchou and pawniard (unless they're scarfed) which is cool.

Team Options
========

-Needs something to take on bulky waters like Slowpoke
-Chinchou forms nice Volttun Core
-so does magnemite
-something to take priority moves like tite's bullet punch, and aqua jets - grass types take on carv or tirtouga who can revenge archen, fire types can switch into bullet punch.
-pawniard can switch into scarf snover/amaura who often revenge and weaken things with knock off
-Needs Defog/ Rapid Spin support - staryu, drilbur can do the job. 

Other Options
########

-Rock Polish on an offensive set
-Choice Scarf Switcheroo + u-turn, Stone Edge, EQ
-err... Tailwind?
-err... Head Smash, but defeatist makes this dumb
-Aqua Tail
