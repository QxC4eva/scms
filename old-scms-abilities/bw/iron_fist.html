<p>The power of <a href="/bw/moves/bullet_punch">Bullet Punch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/comet_punch">Comet Punch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/dizzy_punch">Dizzy Punch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/drain_punch">Drain Punch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/dynamicpunch">DynamicPunch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/fire_punch">Fire Punch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/focus_punch">Focus Punch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/hammer_arm">Hammer Arm</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/ice_punch">Ice Punch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/mach_punch">Mach Punch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/mega_punch">Mega Punch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/meteor_mash">Meteor Mash</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/shadow_punch">Shadow Punch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/sky_uppercut">Sky Uppercut</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/thunderpunch">ThunderPunch</a> is multiplied by 4915/4096 (about 120%) when used by the wielder. It does not power up <a href="/bw/moves/sucker_punch">Sucker Punch</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Iron Fist is a good ability for Pokemon that rely a lot on punching moves, particularly <a href="/bw/pokemon/hitmonchan">Hitmonchan</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/golurk">Golurk</a>, as it boosts the power of Focus Punch to obscene levels. It also gives the elemental punches and Mach Punch some neat utility as coverage moves. For <a href="/bw/pokemon/infernape">Infernape</a>, Iron Fist is a fantastic ability in comparison to <a href="/bw/abilities/blaze">Blaze</a>, even though Mach Punch is the only attack it boosts that Infernape commonly uses. Usually, if a better ability is available, or if the Pokemon does not have to or cannot rely on punching moves, Iron Fist serves little purpose, such as on <a href="/bw/pokemon/ledian">Ledian</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/conkeldurr">Conkeldurr</a>. All in all, Iron Fist is a decent ability, but relies heavily on the Pokemon's movepool.</p>
