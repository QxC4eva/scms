<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This team has been my most successful Ubers team yet, peaking at a rating of 1722, which at the time was #4 on the leaderboard. Meteor Shower is one of the few Ubers teams specifically built around its lead; I was thinking about the various tasks an Ubers anti-lead has to accomplish, and I realized that Ubers has a strong Pokemon that can do almost all of them: Rayquaza. I have a few variations of this team, but they all have two Pokemon in common: Rayquaza and Dialga, the core of Dragons taking advantage of the relatively small pool of Steel types in Ubers.</p>

<p>Meteor Shower is textbook Ubers bulky offense, with a strong Dragons-and-Steel(s) orientation. It relies heavily on seizing momentum from the opponent from the very first turn, and not relinquishing it until the game is over. I generally scout for and attempt to outpredict and eliminate enemy Steels early in the game, then spam high-powered Dragon attacks to weaken the opponent enough to sweep. Although this team is not especially weather-dependent and functions comfortable in either Rain or Sun, I prefer not to have to deal with Kingdra specifically, so I like to try to take out Kyogre early when I see it so Groudon can give me the clear advantage.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/384.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Rayquaza</strong> @ Life Orb<br/ >
Ability: Air Lock<br/ >
EVs: 42 Atk / 252 SpA / 216 Spe<br/ >
Naive Nature<br/ >
- Draco Meteor<br/ >
- Brick Break<br/ >
- ExtremeSpeed<br/ >
- Fire Blast</p>

<p>The star of the show, leadQuaza puts me in a favorable position over the huge majority of Ubers leads. Able to reliably 2HKO even max HP Deoxys-S with Fire Blast + Extremespeed, it doesn't even need to use Draco Meteor to keep Deoxys-S from getting Spikes down, allowing it to keep the pressure up on the opponent. Draco Meteor allows it to OHKO Groudon and Dialga without a massive SpD investment, and 2HKO even the ones that do. As a result, most opponents have to choose between losing their lead and getting Stealth Rock up. Fire Blast also deals nicely with lead Forretress and Scizor. Although I will sacrifice Rayquaza if necessary to take down the other lead without allowing in entry hazards, it usually isn't necessary to do so, and serves as an ordinary MixQuaza for the rest of the game. I use Brick Break over Outrage because of Tyranitar, not wanting to be locked in against Blissey, and because MixQuaza with Brick Break almost single-handedly demolishes Mew Baton Pass teams.</p>

<p><strong>Dialga</strong> @ Life Orb<br/ >
Ability: Pressure<br/ >
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br/ >
Hasty Nature<br/ >
- Draco Meteor<br/ >
- Flamethrower<br/ >
- Outrage<br/ >
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Dialga gives me a number of useful resistances, notable Water, Rock, Bug and Dark, and is my mid-team Stealth Rock user of choice. It has lots of opportunities to come in and force the opponent out, which is perfect for setting up Stealth Rock. 306 speed is actually not bad at all in Ubers, since most of the other base 90 Pokemon do not use max speed, and even Giratina-o usually has HP Fire. Draco Meteor hits like a ton of bricks, especially boosted by Life Orb. Flamethrower is for Scizor, Forretress and Skarmory. Outrage keeps Dialga from being walled by Blissey, and allows Dialga to 2HKO max HP Kyogre (which it can't with Brick Break). I don't really mind being "walled" by Heatran considered that the rest of my team isn't bothered by Heatran very much (especially slow Heatran) and a full-power Draco Meteor does 48.5% - 57.4% to 4 HP/0 SpD Heatran anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Leftovers<br/ >
Ability: Technician<br/ >
EVs: 244 HP / 22 Atk / 76 Def / 168 SpD<br/ >
Careful Nature<br/ >
- Bullet Punch<br/ >
- U-turn<br/ >
- Superpower<br/ >
- Roost</p>

<p>Scizor plays the critically important role of being my only Dragon-resist, a very important job in Ubers. I tend to play pretty conservatively with Scizor, knowing that one misprediction could be trouble against enemy Dragons. U-turn is great for maintaining momentum, one of the keys to this team's success. Superpower is for Dialga and Heatran. I have often considered changing Scizor to SpD Jirachi (which fears mispredicting less), but U-turn and a second priority user are too important to this team to pass up.</p>

<p><strong>Palkia</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br/ >
Ability: Pressure<br/ >
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br/ >
Hasty Nature<br/ >
- Spacial Rend<br/ >
- Surf<br/ >
- Fire Blast<br/ >
- Outrage</p>

<p>Every Ubers team needs something to switch into Kyogre's Water Spouts and something to revenge kill very fast Pokemon like Mewtwo and Darkrai, and Scarf Palkia happily fills both these roles. Even more fortuitously, it 4x resists Fire, making it excellent for pivots involving Scizor and Groudon. Surf and Fire Blast make Palkia equally comfortable in either Sun or Rain, and discourage Steels from switching in. I absolutely despise Choiced Thunder in Ubers, so Outrage is a rather obvious choice for the fourth move to not be walled by Blissey.</p>

<p><strong>Groudon</strong> @ Leftovers<br/ >
Ability: Drought<br/ >
EVs: 200 HP / 112 Atk / 108 Def / 88 Spe<br/ >
Adamant Nature<br/ >
- Thunder Wave<br/ >
- Swords Dance<br/ >
- Stone Edge<br/ >
- Earthquake</p>

<p>Groudon is something of a utility Pokemon for this team; it changes the weather against Rain teams, helps a lot against Jolly Lucario, and protects me from Swords Dance Rayquaza. Spreading paralysis is a pretty devious tactic in Ubers, and ParaDancer Groudon is an expert at it. Ironically, Groudon is one of my team's best options against Lugia.</p>

<p><strong>Mewtwo</strong> @ Life Orb<br/ >
Ability: Pressure<br/ >
EVs: 24 Atk / 252 SpA / 232 Spe<br/ >
Hasty Nature<br/ >
- Aura Sphere<br/ >
- Ice Beam<br/ >
- Selfdestruct<br/ >
- Flamethrower</p>

<p>The best late-game sweeper in Pokemon, hands down. Life Orb Mewtwo absolutely tears holes in the other team, either setting up a late sweep for Rayquaza or Palkia or actually sweeping on its own. Selfdestruct is great for taking out anything I recognize could be trouble, such as Kyogre or Ho-oh. I use Flamethrower over Thunder because the rest of my team will absolutely slaughter any team that loses Scizor, Jirachi or Forretress to Mewtwo.</p>
