<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Provided the move hits, the user must recharge the following turn, and may not attack or switch.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Scald, Surf, and Hydro Pump are all excellent alternatives to this dud attack. The recharge turn is simply not worth the extra Base Power; save Hydro Cannon for in-game fun.</p>
