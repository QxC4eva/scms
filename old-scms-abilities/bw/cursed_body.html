[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Whenever an attack would deal damage to the wielder, there is a 30% chance of that attack being disabled. If the wielder is dealt zero damage from an attack that would have damaged it (such as using <a href="/bw/moves/false_swipe">False Swipe</a> when the target has 1 HP), except for the effect of a final modifier or the attack itself, Cursed Body will still activate normally. Cursed Body has a separate chance of activation on each hit of a contact multi-hit move, but will not stop any multi-hit move before it has been completed. Does not work if the attack hits a <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a>, but does work if the attacker is behind a Substitute, or if the Pokemon with Cursed Body is knocked out by the attack.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/froslass">Froslass</a> is extremely frail so is unlikely to make use of the ability, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/jellicent">Jellicent</a> has <a href="/bw/abilities/water_absorb">Water Absorb</a> which is usually considered to be more effective. As well as this, the fact that Disable is a poor strategy which requires a move to be damaging, coupled with the low effect chance, makes it unreliable.</p>
