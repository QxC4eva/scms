[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by a Pokemon, reduces the power of a damaging Ground-type move that would hit the holder for super effective damage by 50%. Consumed after use. If the holder uses the move Natural Gift, this Berry will provide a one-time 60 Base Power Ground-type attack.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Shuca Berry ought to be one of the more commonly used damage-softening Berries, largely due to the extreme prevalence of Ground-type moves for coverage, particularly Earthquake. However, it has been rather shunted to the sidelines in BW in favour of Air Balloon, which grants immunity to Ground-type attacks, rather than simply halving the damage that would have been taken. It also persists after the first attack, as well as granting immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. However, it does disappear if you mispredict and the holder takes any attack other than a Ground-type attack, something that doesn't happen with Shuca, so Shuca Berry can indeed be an alternative for it on the Pokemon that ordinarily use Air Balloon, if you don't want to take the risk.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Receive from Fennel on first visit to Dream Worldâ€”however, you only get one of the seventeen damage-reducing Berries, and this event cannot be repeated. If you do not receive a Shuca Berry in this way, you must trade for it using Share Shelves in the Dream World.</p>
<p>Wild Rapidash (5%).</p>
