<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Ability Urge activates the ability of an ally Pokemon in a double or triple battle that would normally only work under certain circumstances, or can reuse an ability such as Intimidate after the Pokemon with Intimidate has already been switched in. The abilities that can be re-activated with this item are as follows: Air Lock, Anticipation, Cloud Nine, Download, Drizzle, Drought, Filter, Forewarn, Frisk, Intimidate, Mold Breaker, Pressure, Sand Stream, Slow Start, Snow Warning, Teravolt, Trace, Turboblaze, or Unnerve. It costs three points per use in the Wonder Launcher.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Ability Urge item has no real competitive use. It can only be used in Wi-Fi battles because it is exclusive to Wonder Launcher; as such, it is only really useful when running a weather ability such as Drizzle or Drought in a Wonder Launcher-enabled double or triple battle on Wi-Fi, where you can use it to help gain the upper hand in a weather war.</p>
