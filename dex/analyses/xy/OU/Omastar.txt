Overview
########

Omastar is back for another round of OU, fully prepared to thoroughly wash away anything that obstructs its path. As the strongest specially based user of Swift Swim, Omastar's main purpose is to blast through opposing teams with the help of rain. Its power under rain is great enough to down even Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn! However, Omastar is far from being the fastest Swift Swim user, which means that it will be outsped by threats such as Choice Scarf Garchomp and Choice Scarf Terrakion. Additionally, while Omastar's typing does give it the very useful ability to keep Talonflame and Mega Pinsir in check, it's otherwise mediocre defensively and gives Omastar little switch-in opportunities.

Moves
========

After slipping on a pair of Choice Specs, Omastar becomes one of rain's most menacing weapons. Omastar's Hydro Pump is not to be underestimated, as, with rain support, its power is enough to quickly overwhelm the likes of standard Ferrothorn&mdash;one of rain's biggest and most resilient annoyances. However, despite its high power, Hydro Pump's low PP and 80% accuracy isn't very reliable, so Omastar has to make use of its three other moveslots. Ice Beam hits defensive annoyances to rain teams, such as Latias and Dragonite, while Hidden Power Grass hits Gastrodon, which, despite its rarity and questionable use in OU, can be a resilient roadblock for most rain-based sweepers. The last moveslot is a toss-up between Scald and Surf. Scald is capable of OHKOing many offensive threats, such as Mega Pinsir, and comes with the handy chance of burning Omastar's checks, such as Assault Vest Azumarill. Surf, however, has enough power to reliably OHKO 4 HP / 0 SpD Mega Garchomp and Pokemon of similar defensive capability, so it also is an acceptable option. If Hidden Power's coverage is not needed, feel free to run all three STAB attacks.

Set Details
========

With a Modest nature, maximum Speed investment, and Swift Swim activated, Omastar can outspeed everything up to and including Adamant Choice Scarf Excadrill. Deviating from the recommended spread isn't ideal because Omastar can't afford to lose much Speed or power, not to mention that it already has the ability to take neutral physical attacks fairly well. Running a Timid nature could prove to be useful, as Omastar is then capable of outspeeding Jolly Choice Scarf Excadrill and +1 Jolly Gyarados, but the drop in power is significant (for example, Omastar will lose the 2HKO on physically defensive Ferrothorn), and it is not worth the extra Speed most of the time.

Usage Tips
========

I would honestly love to tell all of you reading this to "use Hydro Pump a lot" and end this section here, but Quality Control insists that this analysis needs to look professional.

Aggression is the name of the game when Omastar is in play. Omastar's main purpose is pressuring offensive and defensive teams alike with its STAB Water-type moves, so don't waste time using coverage attacks unless it's absolutely necessary. Scald is very potent under rainy conditions, so if Hydro Pump's damage output isn't necessary, don't hesitate to go for the burn on potentially antagonistic switch-ins. Additionally, if you're running Hidden Power, try to conceal the identity of its type for as long as possible. Hidden Power is supposed to nab a surprise KO on an unsuspecting Pokemon, and any competent player will almost always scout out coverage moves before comfortably switching in their check to Omastar.

As far as switching Omastar in is concerned, don't be afraid of taking 60% if it means that Omastar has a very good chance of breaking through something on the opposing team. As mentioned before, Omastar is also capable of checking Mega Pinsir and Talonflame under rain, but switching in raw is still very risky because of Earthquake and U-turn. Instead, try to bait out their Flying-type attacks with Omastar's offensive partners, or limit Omastar to revenge killing the aforementioned threats.

Team Options
============

Running Omastar without rain is like betting on a horse in a wheelchair, so Drizzle Politoed is a mandatory teammate. To relieve Politoed of some pressure, it's ideal (but not required) to pack a second rain inducer. Azelf is the best example of this, as it can lead, prevent opposing setup or hazards, lay Stealth Rock, and set up rain. It's advised to pack U-turn and / or Volt Switch support to give Omastar a comfy switch-in. Tornadus-T, Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T are some good examples of Pokemon to fill this role.

Not much can stand properly in the wake of Omastar's torrential might, so it's advised to bring Pokemon that appreciate defensive cores being broken down. Pokemon such as Agility Mega Ampharos, Life Orb Keldeo, mixed Thundurus-T with Knock Off, and Kingdra fit the bill quite well; the possibilities for offensive partners are plentiful, but be sure to keep in mind that some physically-based Pokemon, such as Gyarados and Azumarill, are complemented better by Kabutops. Scizor, once again, gets an individual mention for being able to weaken special walls with Pursuit and U-turn while also luring in the physically defensive Pokemon that Omastar has no trouble breaking through. Latias, Latios, and Zapdos cover Omastar's weaknesses pretty well, and possess a multitude of valuable support options. Lastly, Omastar greatly appreciates entry hazard support, which Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, Focus Sash Mamoswine, and Azelf can reliably provide.

Other Options
##########

Life Orb can replace Choice Specs, but the loss in power is substantial, and generally isn't worth the ability to switch moves. Omastar can boost its wallbreaking power and sweeping potential with Shell Smash, but the lack of vital immediate power as well as high reliance on team support leaves it inferior to Choice Specs. It can be useful, though, as +2 Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump actually 2HKOes Chansey. Hidden Power Psychic, Electric, and Fire can be used to hit other walls to rain teams, namely Toxicroak, Gyarados, and Ferrothorn (outside of rain). However, do note that Hydro Pump, under rain, is capable of 2HKOing many of the intended targets anyway and doesn't require nearly as much prediction to use. Omastar can utilize Knock Off to cripple Chansey, effectively supporting itself. Knock Off can replace Hidden Power, but do keep in mind that it's weak and not ideal to get locked into. Omastar is one of the few Pokemon with access to the entire triad of entry hazards, Toxic Spikes being the most notable for weakening many of Omastar's checks. As already mentioned, however, a non-Choice set can't compare to the utility of Choice Specs. Omastar can also use Rain Dance, but, as mentioned before, a non-Choice set is rather tough to pull off better than Choice Specs.

To wrap this up, Omastar's only other noteworthy offensive options are Earth Power (for Tentacruel and Toxicroak), Ancient Power, and Seismic Toss. None of these attacks are quite powerful enough to warrant use over the recommended attacks, so it's best to leave those options (and the rest of Omastar's movepool) alone.

Checks And Counters
########

**Hydro Pump Sponges**: Pokemon capable of comfortably taking Hydro Pump, such as Assault Vest Azumarill, Slowking, Mega Ampharos, and specially defensive Ferrothorn, fall into this category. This also includes Pokemon immune to Hydro Pump altogether, though they must watch out for certain coverage moves; Pokemon such as Mantine, Toxicroak, and Gastrodon can put a quick stop to Omastar's pressure.

**Speedy Revenge Killers**: Do not make the mistake of overestimating Omastar's Speed tier, as many OU Pokemon are capable of revenge killing Omastar. If it is running Modest, Jolly Choice Scarf Diggersby and anything faster will be able to outspeed and (usually) OHKO Omastar. Timid Omastar will only outspeed everything up to, and including, Jolly Choice Scarf Excadrill. Mega Alakazam deserves a special mention for being able to Trace Omastar's Swift Swim; this allows Mega Alakazam to not only consistently revenge kill Omastar, but also harass the rest of Omastar's team with its increased Speed.

**Chansey**: Chansey doesn't resist Hydro Pump, but is fully capable of taking multiple hits under rain, even if it is surrounded by a few entry hazards. Chansey must be wary of Knock Off, however.

**Offensive Checks**: Some Pokemon are capable of taking a rain-boosted Hydro Pump and overwhelming Omastar with their offensive options. Keldeo, Dragonite, Assault Vest Conkeldurr, Latios, and Latias are examples of such Pokemon.

**Priority Moves**: While Omastar's base 125 Defense shields it from a variety of priority attacks, it's still vulnerable to super effective assaults from Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Breloom. Other powerful priority attacks, specifically from Choice Band Scizor and Azumarill, are bound to take a sizable chunk out of Omastar's health, so be on the lookout for those as well. As is the case with most speedy Pokemon, Prankster Thundurus is always something that Omastar needs to watch out for; however, because Omastar is often a stepping stone for other rain-based sweepers, it isn't a bad idea to trade Omastar's Speed for a quick KO on Thundurus.

**Weather Control**: The simplest countermeasure against Omastar is changing the weather. Be it by the effect of an auto-weather ability, weather move, or simply stalling out the remaining turns of rain, reducing Omastar's Speed is extremely effective when trying to keep it in check. Just don't underestimate the power of Omastar out of rain, because its base 115 Special Attack is still enough to dent many Pokemon in OU.
