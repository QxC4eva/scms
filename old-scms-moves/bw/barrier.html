<h2>Description </h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Defense by two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Defensive boosts from Barrier and moves like it are rarely helpful in allowing the user to overcome its common checks or counters. However, Barrier does have some utility on Baton Pass teams in the form of Mr. Mime and Mew. Mr. Mime is often relied upon in a Baton Pass team to prevent Perish Song and Roar from ending the stat boosting spree prematurely, thanks to its Soundproof ability. Mr. Mime has the option of setting up a Barrier after it has switched in, but Baton Passing Calm Mind boosts with Mr. Mime while using another teammate to boost Defense is generally a better idea. Mew on the other hand can utilize Barrier with any number of its other boosting attacks to fill in any gaps on a Baton Pass team. However, Mew's pure Psychic typing, which gives it a weakness to Pursuit and U-turn, greatly interferes with setting up defensive boosts, so the use of another Defense-passing Pokemon like Iron Defense Scizor is generally a better idea. Overall, Barrier has a small niche with its Defense-boosting abilities, but a very small and situational niche at that.</p>
