[Overview]

<p>Clefable is a decent, unpredictable utility Pokemon, but it's not particularly good at anything. STAB Normal-type attacks hurt the ever abundant Psychic-types, and while it can't beat most standards one-on-one, it can surely damage them well and shuffle Pokemon around with moves like Thunder Wave and Sing.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive
move 1: Blizzard
move 2: Body Slam
move 3: Hyper Beam
move 4: Thunderbolt / Thunder Wave

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Body Slam is always a useful attack for paralysis, and has the potential to hurt some Pokemon with frailer defenses such as Chansey because it has STAB. Blizzard destroys the Rock / Ground types that attempt to wall Clefable (including Golem and Rhydon) and is a good attack in general in RBY. Hyper Beam is an extremely powerful move to cut off a weak Pokemon's remaining HP when other attacks can't. Thunderbolt can hit some Water-types, such as Starmie and Slowbro, moderately hard, while Thunder Wave is a more reliable move for paralysis than Body Slam. Thunderbolt is easily the least valuable move on this set and can be replaced by any of the myriad of options Clefable has if one would like to use something different.</p>

[SET]
name: Status Platform
move 1: Blizzard
move 2: Thunder Wave
move 3: Sing / Counter
move 4: Thunder / Thunderbolt

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set attempts to distribute status effectively. Thunder Wave is the classic debilitating paralysis move, especially alongside Blizzard to hit the Ground-types that are immune to Electric-type moves. Sing can be used for sleep, but its 55% accuracy leaves something to be desired. That's where Counter comes in; it can bounce back random Body Slams that frequent RBY to inflict some good damage off Clefable's decent HP. Thunderbolt complements Blizzard well for type coverage by hitting the Water-types that resist Ice-type attacks. However, Thunder can sometimes OHKO Gyarados and 2HKO Starmie.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Mimic is good if you get Recover; otherwise, Clefable has a good enough movepool already. Reflect and Light Screen can help raise defenses. Submission hurts Normal-types if one cares about that, but it's an unreliable move overall.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Clefable can't do much to Gengar outside of paralyzing it, while Gengar strikes back with Thunderbolt and Seismic Toss. Snorlax doesn't particularly care about paralysis, and it can hit Clefable with powerful Body Slams. Even though they might be weak to one or more of Clefable's moves, Zapdos, Articuno, and Moltres are able to use their high Special to prevent too much damage from Clefable's mediocre Special and will beat Clefable with their moves before Clefable can beat them. Chansey and Alakazam can try to defeat Clefable in an emergency, but they dislike Body Slam; it doesn't do <i>that</i> much to them, but a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam will KO Alakazam and inflict a great deal of damage on Chansey.</p>
