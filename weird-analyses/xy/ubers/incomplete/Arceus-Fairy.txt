    Overview
    ########

        fairy-typing is new, unique, and competitively viable - can be made great use of by arceus with its great all-round stats (offensive potential + natural bulk)
        top-tier mon, one of the better-performing arceus formes this gen with very few real flaws
        fairy typing is great both offensively and defensively, allows fairyceus to function in both offensive and supporting roles
        checks many new threats in yveltal, mmx, mega kangaskhan while retaining the ability to check palkia
        has to watch out for coverage moves on things it otherwise checks
        (notably the cm set) faces competition from other arceus formes

    move 1: Judgment
    move 2: Recover
    move 3: Defog
    move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Roar
    item: Pixie Plate
    evs: 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spd
    nature: Timid

    Moves
    ========

        Judgment is mandatory STAB (mention how Palkia is hit super effectively)
        Recover ensures fairyceus sticks around to perform its supporting role throughout the match
        Defog wipes hazards, is a main draw of this set (and is hence not slashed with anything else) as fairyceus can use it very effectively
        Will-O-Wisp + fairy typing granting neutrality to most types allow fairyceus to check physically-oriented threats in groudon, mega kangaskhan, and ekiller
        Roar can be used to phaze out a common switchin to fairyceus in ho-oh, very useful w rocks up. If another teammate has Defog (see team options), it can be used on move 3 as well if one does not want to give up will-o-wisp.
        Stone edge can be used on move 4 to hit ho-oh. In the same vein, earthquake can be used to hit heatran and mega gengar (note that roar phazes mega gengar through shadow tag; its stab really hurts fairyceus though)


    Set Details
    ========

        Max HP allows fairyceus to take and switch in on many moderately powerful neutral hits, such as from palkia in neutral weather
        160 Def EVs allow fairyceus to stomach mewtwo's psystrike better, as well as things like adamant groudon's eq and mega kangaskhan's return (in case wow misses, or it can switch in on them in a pinch)
        Alternatively run max hp, 160 SpD for some added insurance against palkia and xerneas (+2 modest moonblast only has a 25% to ohko after rocks). This spread can also better insure the team against +1 / +1 cm arceus formes in a pinch - a +1 neutral-hitting 4 spa judgment has a 8.2% chance to 2hko after rocks as opposed to a guaranteed 2hko on 0 spD timid. If using this, roar should be run as fairyceus is not doing anything to these things otherwise.
        either way, remaining 160 EVs in speed with a timid nature to outspeed timid palkia (not using garchomp as a benchmark because the spdef set cannot afford to sacrifice any bulk + garchomp is really not a threat as judgment ohkos).

    Usage Tips
    ========

        switch in aggressively on things it can force out with the threat of burns / super effective judgment. examples include mmx, palkia, non-lo groudon. be wary of super effective coverage moves on things like mmx (iron tail, poison jab) and darkrai (sludge bomb) though (if team structure permits scout for these moves, also dont let fairyceus become sleep fodder especially early game).
        don't be afraid to switch in on predicted dragon moves if your arceus-form has not been revealed, especially if your team is low on options to take them. actually this extends to most moderately powerful hits - provided fairyceus can force out the user afterwards - because recover can be used to heal off the damage the following turn.
        if you see ho-oh on the opposing team though, be alert (double switch), as ho-oh is not threatened by fairyceus + can threaten almost any team significantly with its stabs (if roar or stone edge use accordingly of course)
        don't switch this recklessly into possible status moves, even if you can force out/kill the user afterwards. paralysis destroys its speed advantage over many things, and burn/poison limit the number of times you can switch it in.


    Team Options
    ========

        Ho-oh is a great partner as it destroys the steel-types that plague fairyceus; in return fairyceus clears the field of hazards for it to switch in unhampered
        Ho-oh is both friend and foe though; keep it in check by making sure sr can be set up reliably. Ground-types like lando-t, groudon, gliscor, are good users and teammates as they can also check ho-oh w their physical bulk if need be. Furthermore they do well against heatran / ferro / aegi. Aside from setting sr, each also provides their own niche to the team (respectively: intimidate + uturn, taunt + status absorption, sun support + fire punch + possible phazing)
        Note that a ground type + fairyceus keeps zekrom users guessing and this uncertainty can be taken advantage of - all the more making them useful teammates
        Kyogre can threaten massively with rain-boosted stab; palkia is a good partner as it is the only ogre check that doesn't compound the ho-oh weakness
        An answer to geoxern is required. Spdef Kyogre is a great option, being pretty much the only xern check that does not compound the ho-oh weakness. Scizor is satisfactory too as it can also pivot out of predicted ho-oh switchins with u-turn.


    Calm Mind
    ########
    move 1: Judgment
    move 2: Calm Mind
    move 3: Recover
    move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Thunder / Fire Blast
    item: Pixie Plate
    EVs: 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spd
    Nature: Timid

    Moves
    ========

        Judgment is mandatory STAB
        Calm Mind gives +1 / +1 and possibly allows for fairyceus to clean up lategame
        Recover for longevity, and facilitates fairyceus' possibly gaining multiple boosts
        Will-O-Wisp so fairyceus can check the same important physical threats as it does in the support set. Fairy has no immunities so mono-attacking set is viable. Sweeper-supporter that makes the best of fairy typing's neutrality to most types
        Thunder predominantly for Ho-Oh, also useful if team has spdef ogre problems + takes down lugia faster too. Rain Support recommended if running this
        Fire Blast to exterminate pesky Steel-types bar Heatran
        Refresh can be run as move 4, however it is largely outclassed as a status-bypassing sweeper by Arceus-Water (notably because it handles Ho-oh better)


    Set Details
    ========

        Same spread as the support set as they both have a niche in checking the same physical threats
        (consider a 96 spA spread if thunder is run to ensure a ko on 248 hp ho-oh after rocks? - qc please advise)


    Usage Tips
    ========

        Largely the same as the support set
        Do not set up calm mind rashly and attempt to break holes early-mid game, (basically as far as checks and counters still exist); this set's main focus is still to stay healthy and check stuff, sweeping should only be attempted late game, when teams weakened sufficiently for this set to clean up with its good speed + strong stab
        If anything, status is even more detrimental to this set as it stops it from sweeping effectively lategame


    Team Options
    ========

        Guess what, it's largely the same as support again
        You should have an alternative Defog user if you choose to run this set. (stone edge) Giratina-O is a good choice, as fairyceus checks the dark-types that plague it; in return, gira can nail ho-oh with stone edge and provides some extra insurance against ekiller


    Other Options
    ########

        Toxic on the support set to hit Ho-Oh switch ins. Note that Steel-types, among which are some of fairyceus's prime checks and counters, are immune to this. Thunder Wave smacks Ho-Oh too, but it isn't really hitting anything else of note that would switch into fairyceus (these are overall pretty horrible and are way outclassed by its other options - should they even be here?)
        Perish Song on the support set
