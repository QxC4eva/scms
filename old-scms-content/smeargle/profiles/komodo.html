<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I'm probably one of the less well known artists around here, but I've been frequenting these forums since late 2008. Most of you would recognise me as a WiFier or C&amp;C moderator, but I also dabble in art as well. I got involved with the art scene thanks to macle's art for articles project, and later on got involved with The Smog. I was quite inexperienced at first and got rejected numerous times, but after a lot of practice and guidance from other, more experienced artists, I was well on my way to creating some presentable artwork. I'd like to think of my art as simplistic, cute, and colourful, and I hope to keep improving in the future. I'm still relatively new to being an artist, and I hope to show that ANYBODY can draw with a bit of practice.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>

<p>As far as achievements go, I've contributed a few pieces of artwork to The Smog and various articles around the site, and I run my own art thread. There isn't a lot to say for the time being, but I hope to expand on this in the future.</p>
