<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder uses a damage-dealing Psychic-type move, then the holder consumes this item and the power of that move is increased by 50%. One-time use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In single battles, Psychic Gem is not typically a useful item, unfortunately. While the one-time boost to Psychic-type attacks is nice, most Pokemon using Psychic-type attacks would rather have the more reliable power of Life Orb or Choice items.</p>

<p>Typically Gems are more valuable in the VGC and similar environments, and Psychic Gem is often used here to boost the power of Psychic-type attacks such as Psychic or Psyshock from Pokemon such as Reuniclus. The one-time power boost can come in very useful in such a fast-paced metagame, especially as it comes without any drawbacks, and is notable for its ability to hit most Fighting-types for super effective damage.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Occur randomly in Dust Clouds.</p>
