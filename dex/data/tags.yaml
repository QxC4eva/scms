        OU (Overused) is Smogon's fundamental usage-based tier. With the exception of              Pokémon banished to the Uber tier, every Pokémon can be used in OU, including              Pokémon from UU, RU, and NU.

A Pokémon is truly 'OU' if a typical competitive player is more           than 50% likely to encounter that Pokemon at least once in a given day of playing          (20 battles).
