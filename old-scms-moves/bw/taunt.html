[SHORT DESC]
Lasts 3 turns and the target can only use attacking moves.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prevents the target from using any moves besides direct attacking moves for three turns. For sake of simplicity, these are defined as moves that have a Base Power. Thus, you may use Rapid Spin under Taunt, but not Toxic. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute. If the target cannot use any direct attacking moves (ie. if it is holding a Choice item and locked on a non-attacking move, or has a moveset consisting of only non-attacking moves), then it is forced to Struggle until the Taunt ends. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Taunt is one of the best moves in the game, and one of the most important tools for offensive teams in taking down opposing stall teams. With Taunt, the enemy is incapable of using any non-attacking move, ensuring that the user is protected from status and phazing from Roar and Whirlwind, the opponent cannot heal or lay down entry hazards, and the enemy cannot set up. The utility of Taunt is incredible and nearly endless. Taunt is most commonly paired with a boosting move such as Swords Dance and Dragon Dance. This is because Taunt will normally be used against an offensively weak Pokemon that normally relies on status to deal with dangerous threats. With the opponent unable to cripple the Taunt user with burn or paralysis, the user of Taunt is free to start boosting as the opponent either switches or feebly attacks the user with a weak attack. This strategy is most commonly seen on Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados. With Taunt, Gyarados is able to set up on Pokemon it's normally not able to, such as Blissey and Skarmory.</p>
