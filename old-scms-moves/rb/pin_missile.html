<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hits 2-5 times in one turn. There is a 37.5% chance to hit either 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% chance to hit either 4 or 5 times. If one hit faints a Substitute, the move will be halted.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The best Bug-type move, but pretty much a lackluster option. It's ironically most used most commonly by Jolteon. Even its ability to hit Psychic-types super effectively does not warrant it usage, since its power is unreliable and its users are pretty bad from a competitive point of view.</p>
