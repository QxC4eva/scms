Moves
========

    Draco Meteor is your strongest STAB attack for wallbreaking.
    Superpower beats Chansey, Tyranitar, and Steel-types.
    Iron Tail nails Fairy-types and 2HKO's 252 HP Tyranitar.
    Fire Blast lets Hydreigon beat every Steel-type bar Heatran.
    Roost lets you recover some damage and come in more times.

Set Details
========

    Mild allows you to take special attacks better and Hydreigon resists more special types better than physical attacks
    Rash should be used if you want to take physical hits better.
    Chansey cannot be 2HKOed by Superpower without Stealth Rock.
    232 Speed lets you outrun neutral speed Kyurem-B
    Dragon Pulse can be used if you dislike the power drop from Draco Meteor
    Expert Belt can be used if you dislike the recoil from Life Orb but your damage will be lower.
    Earth Power can be used over Fire Blast to hit Heatran, but it hits the other Steel-types weaker than Fire Blast.
    Charge Beam can be used to 2HKO both Togekiss and Azumarill on the switch, making it really scary to switch in on.


Usage Tips
========

    Hydreigon should be used during the early- and mid-game to soften up walls on the opposing team and to prepare for something else to sweep.
    Try to switch in on an attack that Hydreigon resist, as Hydreigon have good bulk.


Team Options
========

    Hydreigon works well with a Hazard setter as it helps it grab some important 2HKO's.
    A Fairy-type check if Hydreigon lacks Iron Tail or Flash Cannon.
    Something to check Chansey if you don't run Superpower.
    U-turn and Volt Switch help Hydreigon to switch in more easily. Rotom-W, Genesect and Landorus-T works well with Hydreigon.
    A sweeper for late-game cleaning after Hydreigon have finished its job.
