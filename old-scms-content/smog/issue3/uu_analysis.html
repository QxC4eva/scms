<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/media/smog/uumetagame.jpg" alt="UU Metagame" /></div>

<p>The UU tier continues to evolve at a rapid pace as several major players from the past (Crobat and Shaymin) were removed, while at the same time new, influential Pokemon dropped down to UU (Dugtrio and Donphan). The metagame is fresh and vibrant, with new strategies constantly cropping up and becoming popular. Surprisingly, despite all the additions and removals from the tier, it has ended up balancing itself out remarkably well. All in all it's a great period of time to be involved in UU, and I'll try and infuse some of the tier's vitality into this metagame analysis.</p>

<p>Recent changes to the tier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Out of the three suspects removed from the last testing phase, <strong>Crobat</strong> and <strong>Shaymin</strong> were voted decidedly BL and were removed from the tier, whereas <strong>Honchkrow</strong> was allowed back into UU by a small margin.</li>
<li>Through changes in OU usage, <strong>Umbreon</strong> was used enough to be promoted up to the OU tier, while <strong>Dugtrio</strong> and <strong>Donphan</strong> didn't meet the OU usage requirements and dropped down.</li>
</ul>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/yanmega.png" alt="" />

<p><strong>Yanmega</strong> is currently one of UU's most defining threats. Whereas in the early stages following its addition to UU, its Speed Boost ability was thought to be the superior choice, now almost all Yanmega are seen running Tinted Lens in conjunction with Choice Specs. Tinted Lens is a very potent ability when combined with a strong STAB attack; in this case, Yanmega's Bug Buzz becomes frighteningly powerful after the Choice Specs boost, and Tinted Lens lets Yanmega do up to 37% to the likes of specially defensive Registeel, a Steel-type with 150 base SpD who normally resists the attack and would shrug it off were it not for Yanmega's ability.</p>

<p>With Crobat gone, Moltres is the only remaining Pokemon that 4x resists Bug and has the bulk to actually take a Bug Buzz (Blaziken has a 4x resist as well but its sub-par defenses stop it from switching in). However, Moltres is slower than Yanmega and suffers from the same 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, so most teams resort to simply using Pokemon with high enough Special Defense stats to take the hit. Chansey, specially defensive Milotic, and Registeel are seen as common checks for it, but the latter two can't really afford to switch in too many times.</p>

<p>It is said that Yanmega can play around its Stealth Rock weakness so much so that it gets 3 shots at the opposing team - one before Stealth Rock goes up or just as it is set up, one at 50% health after a single switch in, and one at 1 HP after switching in twice. Three chances to Bug Buzz are usually more than enough to weaken its check, take out said check (for example Registeel, who is 3HKOed), then launch a final offensive with a single hit point remaining. Add to this the fact that UU has just had the addition of an excellent spinner in Donphan, whose 120 base Attack and powerful moves let it destroy any Spiritomb or (to a lesser extent) Mismagius trying to block its spin, and Yanmega becomes all the more threatening. This "DonMega" combination has become a very common sight on a lot of balanced teams. Yanmega is undoubtedly one of UU's most powerful and controversial Pokemon, and is the most likely candidate as a suspect when the time for nominations comes.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/roserade.png" alt="" />

<p>During the test phase when Honchkrow, Shaymin, and Crobat were suspended from the tier, <strong>Roserade</strong> was often seen as a Life Orb attacker. This set was a big threat because of its ability to put any of its potential counters to sleep, and the way it could chip away at the health of Natural Cure Chansey by putting it to Sleep and following through with Leaf Storm, and rinsing and repeating as necessary. However, recently Roserade has been seeing a lot more use as a Spiker. This is a significant change since Egg group breeding incompatibilities prevent Spikes from being used in conjunction with two of Roserade's strongest moves - Leaf Storm and Sleep Powder. There are several possible reasons for the change in the way UU's #1 used Pokemon of last month is seeing play.</p>

<p>Like many things in UU, Roserade is affected both directly and indirectly by Yanmega's presence. Yanmega has 5 more base Speed points, can come in on a 4x resisted Leaf Storm, and has a STAB Air Slash that can OHKO offensive Roserade variants. Indirectly, Yanmega caused the metagame to adapt to its powerful special attacks, and in turn the same Pokemon that can stop Yanmega from sweeping also act as a roadblock for Roserade. Registeel and Chansey are increasingly common, and most teams have some sort of physical priority attack to deal with Yanmega, something that Roserade with its base 60 HP and base 55 Defense does not appreciate in the slightest. It might also be that Yanmega is tilting the metagame in favor of balanced teams that have the defenses to withstand its attacks. These teams do very well with Spikes support, a niche Roserade can fill excellently.</p>

<p>The addition of Dugtrio to the tier has also had a detrimental effect on offensive Roserade, since it is all to easily trapped and its weak Defense preyed upon by the faster Dugtrio. Roserade needs 252 HP and 120 Defense EVs with a neutral nature to survive an Adamant Choice Band Dugtrio's Earthquake, and offensive sets simply cannot afford to make that kind of defensive investment. Still, while Roserade's offensive effectiveness might have dropped down a notch, keep the potential power of a LO 140 BP STAB move from 125 base SpA in the back of your mind when you think of going to your Taunter straightaway upon seeing the Bouquet Pokemon.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/mismagius.png" alt="" />

<p><strong>Mismagius</strong> enjoyed a period of time during the suspect suspension where the tier lacked concrete counters, Registeel being the only Pokemon to really be able to stand up to the offensive sets. Honchkrow's and Crobat's absence meant that there was little way to revenge kill it as well. Now, however, Mismagius has several more threats to worry about. Honchkrow is back and is ready to Pursuit the Ghost to its death given a moment's notice, and Dugtrio has also joined the group of Pokemon that can threaten Mismagius with Night Slash / Pursuit. Now, offensive Mismagius users have to make a choice of whether they want to gear towards beating stall teams - run Taunt to stop Milotic's Haze and Altaria's Perish Song, and Hidden Power Fighting to beat Chansey and damage Registeel; or prepare for the more offensive threats - run Substitute for insurance against Sucker Punch and Pursuit, and Thunderbolt to deal with Honchkrow. Mismagius also has to vie for a place on the standard offensive team with a similarly playing Ghost - Charge Beam Rotom. Rotom has lower Special Attack and Speed, but makes up for it by having useful dual STABs, a resistance to Steel preventing Registeel from dealing with it nearly as easily (unless it runs Shadow Claw specifically for Rotom, which some actually do), and slightly more physical Defense as well. Still, Mismagius is by no means a threat that can be dismissed, and the ease with which it can accumulate Calm Minds and then sweep teams in the blink of an eye should not be forgotten.</p>

<p>A new set specifically geared towards beating stall has been seeing a good deal of play. The Stall Breaker Mismagius with Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Pain Split can effectively shut down many parts of the standard defensive team while also providing spin blocking support. Its advantages over Spiritomb are a much faster Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, both of which are far more effective when used by a fast Pokemon, and a Ground immunity to help it deal with Donphan.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/registeel.png" alt="" />

<p><strong>Registeel</strong>'s utility is unquestionable in the tier. It has the ability to switch into a massive selection of threats, basically anything without a STAB Fire, Fighting, or Ground attack, and proceed to spread paralysis with Thunder Wave or set up Stealth Rock. In a tier starved of resistances to Ghost, Dark, Psychic, and Flying attacks, Registeel and its excellent 150 defenses can be used on a large variety of teams. However, its own excellence can often be its downfall. Many times a player counts on Registeel to check just too many threats, and it ends up getting weakened over the course of the battle and eventually overwhelmed. This is where its lack of reliable recovery really lets it down, although Rest variants of Registeel are becoming increasingly common as players begin to realise just how much they count on the Steel wall to keep their teams together.</p>

<p>The addition of Dugtrio and Donphan to UU was not a welcome change for Registeel. Donphan gets a free switch in on pretty much any of its standard attacks, being immune to Thunder Wave and taking pittance from Iron Head. It can then proceeding to spin away the Stealth Rock Registeel tries so hard to put up while Registeel flees in fear of its powerful Earthquake. Choice Band Dugtrio is also a very big threat, since the mole can trap and take out a weakened Registeel with ease (although it cannot afford to switch in on any of Registeel's attacking moves). Dugtrio is very often used alongside some of the powerful sweepers Registeel holds in check, such as Specs Tinted Lens Yanmega and Swellow. This combination has proven to be a very dangerous strategy if executed correctly. Several players have started running Shed Shell on Registeel to escape Dugtrio's (and the rarer Magneton's) clutches, but the lack of Leftovers recovery inevitably leads to Registeel being worn down even quicker.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/milotic.png" alt="" />

<p><strong>Milotic</strong> retains its position as UU's premier bulky Water, and is an essential part of the tier makeup - both defensively and offensively. It sees play on stall teams as an excellent counter to threatening Fire- and Water-types, anything from Arcanine, Blaziken, and Houndoom, to Feraligatr and the rain sweepers. With Haze, it can stop many other dangerous set up sweepers, such as Calm Mind Mismagius and Slowbro, from becoming a threat as well. With its excellent defensive stats, it can take most neutral attacks with ease and Recover from the damage later. In UU, no other bulky Water-type can really hold a candle to Milotic.</p>

<p>Offensive Milotic has a lot of uses as well. It is often seen utilizing its respectable Speed and decent Special Attack, further bolstered by Life Orb, to become quite the threat. STAB Hydro Pump does big damage to anything that doesn't resist it, and is in fact strong enough to 2HKO most Clefable as well. Ice Beam and Hidden Power Electric complete its coverage, while it can use Recover to offset the Life Orb recoil as well as brush off weak attacks.</p>

<p>Many balanced teams have started focusing on Milotic's Special Defense much more than before. Whereas Milotic used to serve as a mixed wall and jack of all trades, it is now often seen EVed very heavily in Special Defense to take hits from Specs Yanmega, and to a lesser extent, Blaziken and Houndoom. This does open it up to physical attacks much more than before. For example, if Milotic doesn't invest in its physical Defense stat, it will be 2HKOed by a once Dragon Danced Jolly Life Orb Feraligatr's Earthquake, something it was able to withstand quite easily before the need for such heavy special emphasis. Stall players can still afford to use Milotic as a mixed wall, though, because they almost always have Chansey waiting in the wings for Yanmega.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/donphan.png" alt="" />

<p><strong>Donphan</strong> has shown itself to be a very valuable addition to UU and has been a top level contender ever since it dropped down into the tier. There used to be a distinct lack of strong physical Ground-types in UU, and Donphan's STAB Earthquake off its highly respectable base 120 Attack stat can put a dent in many things that were not used to it at all. Donphan gets plenty of opportunities to switch into play, most commonly on Stealth Rock users such as Steelix, Regirock, and Registeel, and then can threaten with a super effective Earthquake. As they switch in fear of Donphan's STAB, it can use the opportunity to Rapid Spin and get rid of the Stealth Rock they fought so hard to put up. It is an excellent user of Stealth Rock itself, and can use the many switch ins it gets as an opportunity to support its own team with the quintessential entry hazard.</p>

<p>With its great physical bulk and neutrality to the common physical attacking types of Ground and Fighting, Donphan can serve as a check for a large variety of physically based threats. It is as close to a counter for Honchkrow as there is in UU, being able to switch in and take any two of its Life Orb boosted attacks (provided Super Luck doesn't put a damper on your plans), before seeing it off with Stone Edge. Many other physical threats such as Swords Dance Drapion, Swords Dance Toxicroak, Dragon Dance Altaria, and physical versions of Arcanine and Nidoking cannot hope to sweep until an opposing Donphan is severely weakened or taken out. When it comes to spinning, Donphan has many moves at its disposal to ward off any brave spin blocker coming in to try and stop it. Spiritomb cannot repeatedly switch into STAB Earthquakes, and Mismagius and Rotom should be wary of a super effective Assurance if they have to come into Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>Because of its great utility, Donphan finds itself on many different kinds of teams; but arguably the teams that make the best use of its skills are balanced teams which don't focus on either attacking or stalling too heavily. Full out offensive teams find Donphan too slow to really fit in, and while he can provide reliable Stealth Rock support, he can't use Explosion like Regirock and Steelix, and so may not seem as appealing. Conversely, stall teams can be put off by Donphan's lack of recovery and its vulnerability to common Spikers such as Omastar and Roserade due to its low Special Defense and weaknesses to common special attacking types. For this reason, stall teams may prefer a spinner such as Hitmontop, who has more balanced defenses and can spin against a wider range of foes. Nevertheless, Donphan has proven itself to be a solid and reliable Pokemon in its short stint in UU so far, and is a common sight on many teams.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/honchkrow.png" alt="" />

<p><strong>Honchkrow</strong> managed to survive its suspect suspension period and was narrowly voted back down to UU, where it once again takes up the title of the most threatening physical attacker in the tier. The Big Boss Pokemon has many qualities that make it a threat to even the most prepared team: its excellent base 125 Attack stat, perfect coverage with its two STABs + Superpower, and two very useful abilities that let it either switch into several Pokemon freely or make even the staunchest of its counters quail. Even its base 71 Speed, low by sweeper standards, is high enough to outspeed all the defensive Pokemon of UU with little investment, and lets it run a Scarf set and keep an Attack boosting nature at the same time. Then of course there is its Sucker Punch, the second strongest priority attack in the game after Absol's own, which makes up for its low Speed in many cases. All in all, Honchkrow can be a simply terrifying Pokemon to deal with, but it does have some limitations that keep it in the tier, albeit barely.</p>

<p>Donphan's addition to UU gave the metagame a good check for Honchkrow, since Donphan's excellent physical Defense isn't squandered by a weakness to Superpower like Regirock, Steelix, and Registeel. Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil also do much to keep Honchkrow in check, as it can't really switch in more than twice against the average team. While Honchkrow does do a great job of weakening walls and helping fellow sweepers do their job, its inability to switch into the majority of attacks can cause it to be very difficult to get into play, leaving it little more than a liability when you need that key resistance. Still, a well played Honchkrow can easily shift the tide of a battle, and is definitely a threat to be prepared for.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/uxie.png" alt="" /> <img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/mesprit.png" alt="" />

<p><strong>Uxie</strong> and <strong>Mesprit</strong> are both excellent support Pokemon in UU that fulfill similar roles. Uxie is the more defensive of the duo, being able to make good use of its wide support movepool with its impressive defenses. It is a reliable user of Stealth Rock, and with access to moves such as Trick and U-turn, Uxie often finds itself in the lead position. It's bulky enough to not mind Ambipom's Fake Out unduly, and fares equally well against any lead that can't hit it super effectively. There are two main types of Uxie lead: Trick Scarf and general status support. Trick Scarf Uxie is more of an anti-lead, since if it manages to swap the Scarf onto the likes of Ambipom it will severely cut its utility. The more general support Uxie makes use of its two status moves, Yawn and Thunder Wave, to start building up an advantage for its team from the get go. Many Uxie users have started running Zen Headbutt over Psychic as their STAB move in order to hit Roserade and Mismagius on their weaker defensive side. While Uxie is a pain for offensive teams to get rid of, it poses very little offensive threat itself, and so is often seen as a free set up for Spikes users such as Omastar on more defensively inclined teams.</p>

<p>Mesprit also has great defensive stats, 80/105/105 compared to Uxie's 75/130/130, but also has very nice base 105 attacking stats to boot. While Mesprit runs defensive sets similarly well to Uxie, it can also use Calm Mind and Charge Beam as a way of boosting its offenses and acting as a powerful bulky sweeper. With a good offensive movepool consisting of Psychic, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam as notable moves, it can be quite the surprising threat to teams that don't expect it. Uxie's access to Memento and overall greater bulk makes it the superior choice as a Dual Screens, Trick Room, and Rain Dance supporter, though.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/venusaur.png" alt="" /> <img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/leafeon.png" alt="" />

<p>With Haze Milotic being a staple on many a stall team, the metagame turned to new set up sweepers to replace the old standards. One of the new trends was the Swords Dancing Grass-type, an idea that would be considered a complete gimmick in OU, but one that can be very effective indeed in the lower tiers. The two biggest users of this strategy are <strong>Venusaur</strong> and <strong>Leafeon</strong>, both of which stepped up alongside Roserade to fill the void left by Shaymin, and each has its own slightly different niche and advantages over the other.</p>

<p>Venusaur is the more 'balanced' sweeper because of several reasons. Its stat spread gives it roughly equal defenses on both sides of the spectrum - good HP and Defense and a great Special Defense - and Venusaur is generally the easier of the two to fit onto a team. It has access to Sleep Powder to not only temporarily take out an opposing threat, but also to give Venusaur a guaranteed Swords Dance boost to begin its sweep. It can afford to come into bulky Waters such as Milotic to set up a lot easier since it doesn't mind taking the odd Ice Beam or two, which can be recovered off with Synthesis once the foe is asleep. Venusaur's Poison typing also comes in very handy for soaking up Toxic Spikes upon entry, thus greatly supporting the rest of the team by simply switching in. Overall, Venusuar is a reliable Pokemon that almost always pulls its weight in battle.</p>

<p>Leafeon, on the other hand, needs a bit more finesse to be played effectively. In terms of pure sweeping, it is easily the better choice: it has a much higher base Attack stat, 110 compared to Venusaur's base 82; it's base 95 Speed is a lot higher than Venusaur's base 80; and its primary STAB move, Leaf Blade, is 10 BP stronger and has a high critical hit chance over Venusaur's Seed Bomb. However, it is also a lot more vulnerable to special attackers than Venusuar, since its low 65 base HP and Special Defense can't really stand up to super effective Ice Beams. While this does make setting up on bulky Waters a more difficult task, Leafeon's pure Grass typing and excellent base 130 Defense makes setting up on resisted Earthquakes a piece of cake. Donphan, Dugtrio, and Steelix essentially give Leafeon a free set up, even more so if Leafeon has Synthesis, since then it can get multiple Swords Dances under its belt if the opponent plays stubbornly and doesn't switch. And while Leafeon can't support its team by absorbing Toxic Spikes, it can provide some more specific support by Baton Passing its Swords Dance boosts to other sweepers all too willing to make the most of them: Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Arcanine with ExtremeSpeed common examples.</p>

<p>To combat the rising popularity of SD Grass-types, a lot of stall players have begun to use Perish Song / Haze Altaria as a replacement for, or alongside, Milotic. Altaria's high Special Defense and similar resistances to Fire and Water let it play in much the same way, and being able to get rid of stat boosts from Mismagius and the like is also helpful. However, unlike Milotic's weakness, Altaria packs a 4x resistance to Grass, meaning it can take on these new physical threats a lot easier.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/dugtrio.png" alt="" />

<p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>'s impact on the metagame was not nearly as radical as was speculated. When it was first declared to have dropped down to UU, many people predicted a fall in stall teams as Chansey got trapped and taken out, a drop in Registeel usage, and an unbeatable combination of Yanmega and Dugtrio sweeping all of UU. While stall and Registeel did take a hit with the mole triplet's presence in the tier, it was hardly as dramatic as people has assumed it would be. Dugtrio + Yanmega / Swellow, while being a good combination, is by no means a fail-safe method of sweeping. In theory, Dugtrio sounds excellent, but in practice there are several things about it that can let it down.</p>

<p>Firstly there is the fact that Dugtrio is incredibly frail - it is 2HKOed by Registeel's Iron Head and by Chansey's Seismic Toss after Stealth Rock damage, and it cannot OHKO the standard spreads in return. This means that one cannot simply switch Dugtrio into the Pokemon it's trapping heedlessly - it can only come in on a Stealth Rock, Softboiled, or Thunder Wave. The other thing that sometimes disappoints with Dugtrio is its low Attack stat - it really needs an Adamant nature to even think about trapping the likes of Steelix, Regirock, and even Registeel and Chansey. However, by running Adamant it ends up not being able to outspeed max Speed Timid Mismagius (they both sit at 339 Speed), Espeon, and Ambipom. These are the kind of frail sweepers that Dugtrio is actually very good at taking out, much moreso than the bulky Regis and Steelix, which despite being weak to Ground take a whole lot less from Dugtrio's Earthquake because of their excellent defenses. So the Dugtrio user must choose between Adamant and Jolly: trapping and taking out weakened defensive behemoths, or being able to revenge kill a host of potentially dangerous sweepers. Add to that the way in which many players are adapting to Dugtrio's presence, for example running Defense EVs on the standard Spiker Roserade (120 Def EVs in addition to max HP guarantee survival from a CB Adamant Earthquake, letting Roserade retaliate with an OHKO) and occasionally giving Shed Shell to Chansey and Registeel, means Dugtrio, while it can be instrumental on the right team, is far less of a 'guaranteed sweep' than predicted.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/moltres.png" alt="" /> <img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/houndoom.png" alt="" /> <img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/blaziken.png" alt="" /> <img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/arcanine.png" alt="" />

<p>While the assorted Fire-types of UU are usually kept in check by the excellent bulky Water Milotic, it is put under so much pressure and is relied on to check so much that it's often very easy to overload it with similarly checked sweepers and break through to sweep. <strong>Moltres</strong> is probably the most threatening Fire-type to any team lacking a Chansey. Life Orb Fire Blast off its high base 125 SpA stat tears up everything that doesn't resist it, and a complimentary STAB Air Slash makes short work of most things that do. Hidden Power Grass lets it beat Regirock and Milotic easier, and Roost complete the set, letting Moltres recover off Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage. Moltres works in a very similar vein to Yanmega - come in on a predicted Stealth Rock, soften up walls with its main STAB attack + Air Slash, and then come back in near the end of the game to complete its sweep.</p>

<p><strong>Houndoom</strong> can be very difficult to deal with as well, especially if it manages to grab a Nasty Plot boost as you switch out in fear of its STAB attacks. Milotic is really the only Water-type that can stand up to it, since Slowbro and Slowking are both disposed of with Dark Pulse. Even Chansey needs to fear boosted LO Fire Blast, which can 2HKO it with ease. However, Houndoom often has a very hard time setting up and becoming as big a threat as it has the potential to be, but it makes for a very effective sweeper that can just bulldoze its way through more defensively inclined teams. <strong>Blaziken</strong> is in a similar boat, being an excellent stallbreaker but finding it difficult to sweep teams that have a bit more offense behind them. It now has to make the choice of which Hidden Power to use - Grass to hit Milotic, Slowbro, and to a lesser extent Regirock, or Ice to beat Altaria. At a glance it seems that Grass is easily the better choice, and this has lead to many stall teams relying solely on Altaria as Blaziken check, making them incredibly weak to one that chooses to buck the trend and run HP Ice. <strong>Arcanine</strong> is most often seen in the lead position, being able to take on Roserade and Yanmega very well. It doesn't pose too much of a sweeping threat, however, unless it is passed some Attack boosts from the likes of Leafeon. With Life Orb and a passed Swords Dance, Arcanine essentially becomes UU's Lucario, destroying stall and offense left and right with its STAB attack and ExtremeSpeed. Flare Blitz's recoil often ends up taking Arcanine out quite quickly, but it can definitely leave a mark and take half the opposing team down with it before it goes.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/mismagius.png" alt="" /> <img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/rotom.png" alt="" />

<p>Mismagius is the most common Ghost-type in UU, but that doesn't mean the other Ghosts have lost their places in the tier. <strong>Rotom</strong> recently saw a surge in usage as people discovered the Substitute Charge Beam set, a sweeper that could not only set up on Chansey, but also wasn't stopped cold by Registeel like Calm Mind Mismagius was. Haze Milotic can be hit with a hefty STAB Thunderbolt, and with its two STAB attacks providing perfect coverage, Rotom is quite the threat to the unprepared team. It's lower offensive stats make Rotom harder to fit onto a team than Mismagius, but with the right support it can end up being a lot more threatening. Relatively low Speed does let it down sometimes against the likes of Leafeon and Houndoom.</p>

<p><strong>Spiritomb</strong> used to be the premier spinblocker of UU, but with Donphan's addition to the tier and the rise in Spikes Roserade with the removal of Crobat, the grounded Ghost found itself struggling to keep up. Its low Speed means that it has to take two Earthquakes from Donphan if the opponent predicts the switch in, something that Spiritomb can ill afford. A very effective strategy that several players have recently started using is heavy Spikes usage + dual Ghosts. Using Mismagius/Rotom and Spiritomb in tandem means that it is nigh on impossible for the opponent to spin away your Spikes and Stealth Rock, since even if they use Foresight with Hitmontop or Odor Sleuth with Donphan on one of your Ghosts, you can just switch to the other one which will still be immune to Rapid Spin. Spiritomb is the best Ghost-type to be used on the same team as another since it lacks the Pursuit weakness that makes the other Ghosts so vulnerable. CroTomb (Rest Talk Calm Mind) has seen a massive drop in popularity since the early days of the New UU, most likely because of abundance of Haze Milotic, Perish Song Altaria, and set up sweepers such as Swords Dance Venusaur that can take advantage of it. Recently people have also started to use Spiritomb's oft forgotten base 92 Attack stat as well, using Choice Band sets with Pursuit, Sucker Punch, and Trick to mess up many of Spiritomb's common answers. While you may not see the grinning Ghost as much as its brethren, be prepared to deal with whatever surprise your opponent may have in store when you do.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/kangaskhan.png" alt="" /> <img src="/dex/media/sprites/dp/tauros.png" alt="" />

<p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong> has similarly seen a sudden spike in usage, and it's easy to see why. Because of its Scrappy Ability, Kangaskhan gains perfect coverage with just a STAB Return + a Fighting-type move. This translates to it being one of the most effective Choice Banders in the tier. Return deals with everything but Regirock, Registeel, Steelix, and Omastar, and these are hit very hard by a Choice Band boosted Hammer Arm. The last two slots can be used for a variety of things as well, ranging from Fake Out and Sucker Punch to Fire Punch and even Wish. Sub Punch Kangaskhan is also a nightmare for stall teams. It can use its 105 base HP to set up Substitutes unbreakable by Chansey's Seismic Toss, and then proceed to hit the incoming switch with a powerful 150 Base Power move. All of its stats besides Special Attack are good, and Kangaskhan is a powerful and bulky threat that can sweep all too easily.</p>

<p><strong>Tauros</strong> works in a similar way to Kangaskhan, but has slightly higher Attack, considerably higher Speed, and Intimidate to work with. While it cannot hits Ghost-types with Normal and Fighting moves like Kangaskhan can, it can outspeed and Pursuit Mismagius / Rotom to death early on in the game, setting itself up for a sweep later on. It has a wider movepool than Kangaskhan, with Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Zen Headbutt on offer as well, and once the opposing Ghost-type is removed, it can sweep with extreme ease against offensive teams. However, it cannot run anything like Kangaskhan's Sub Punch set, and so is a lesser concern to stall teams.</p>
