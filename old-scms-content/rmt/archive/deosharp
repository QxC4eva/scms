<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>With a new generation of pokemon comes a new style of team building. I built this near the start of XY to abuse the plethora of defoggers that became prevalent as the metagame developed, and the idea was to combo the best hazard stacker with Bisharp. Although this team never really saw tournament play it gained a lot of popularity with the ladder players. Several people peaked top 10 on both PO and PS with this team. If you laddered XY OU on either server during November-December than you've probably seen this team, which is the main reason it never got to see tournament play. Also, I realize i posted this a little late but now is better than never.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/deoxys-defense.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Deoxys-D</strong> @ Red Card<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
IVs: 0 Atk<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Taunt</p>

<p>I chose Deo-D as my hazard setter over Deo-S just because I believe that Deo-D can set hazards much more reliably and is able to outspeed all that it needs to all the while having superior bulk. SR/Spikes for obvious reasons and Taunt/Twave to stop defoggers and irritate offense by randomly dragging out a pokemon with Red Card and getting a paralysis on it. Twave also helps with Lati@s trying to defog early game and ensuring at least one hazard gets up. 4 SpD to prevent dying from Genesect Bug Buzz.</p>

<p><strong>Bisharp</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Defiant<br />
EVs: 32 HP / 252 Atk / 224 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Knock Off<br />
- Iron Head<br />
- Sucker Punch</p>

<p>A new powerhouse in the XY meta, with a buffed move to abuse being Knock Off. Bisharp's main purpose on this squad is to threaten the opposing teams defogger, by coming in and getting a free +2 attack from the -1 Evasion with Defiant. The other purpose it has is to do a lot of damage(Defiant negating King's Shield drop) to Aegislash having a chance to OHKO in order to get rid of Mega Lucario's biggest nuisance. Spamming Knock Off is what this thing does best because losing items is never good for the opponent and can be troublesome to any team. Sucker Punch isn't very reliable priority but its extremely strong and can push opposing teams into a corner if they let you get +2. EVs allow you to outspeed most Rotom-W and most SpDef Heatrans, with the remaining hp for a little bit of bulk.</p>

<p><strong>Lucario</strong> @ Lucarionite<br />
Ability: Inner Focus<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
IVs: 0 Atk<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Aura Sphere<br />
- Vacuum Wave<br />
- Flash Cannon</p>

<p>There's a reason this thing was banned almost unanimously. Probably the best sweeper that was in the meta, able to get +2 with Nasty Plot and do loads of damage to teams. This Lucario has the ability to open up lots of holes in teams as well as sweep late game. This was the MVP of the team many times over and put a ton of pressure on your opponent by just sending it out. EVs are pretty straight forward.</p>

<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/thundurus.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Thundurus</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Prankster<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
IVs: 0 Atk / 30 Def<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>Not only can Thundurus threaten a majority of the meta with its powerful moves and amazing speed tier, it can also paralyze anything faster/scarf users if you want to open up an opportunity for another member of the team. This set is one of my favorites because it can put pressure on opposing teams with a set up and can also slow down any threat on the other side. Again, EVs are straight forward.</p>

<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/azumarill.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Azumarill</strong> @ Sitrus Berry<br />
Ability: Huge Power<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Belly Drum<br />
- Play Rough<br />
- Aqua Jet<br />
- Waterfall</p>

<p>With new 6th gen breeding mechanics Azumarill is able to use Belly Drum+Aqua Jet, turning it into one of the hardest hitting pokemon in the tier after a Belly Drum. Because of its great typing and above average bulk it actually gets many opportunities to set up. These EVs and nature allowed Azumarill to outspeed minimum speed Rotom-W, which at the time of this team's popularity it was common to see no speed or low investment Rotom-W and allowed for quite a few surprise kills while still being extremely strong at +6. Another viable spread is: 124 HP / 252 Atk / 132 Spd Adamant Nature. This spread allows you to outspeed Aegislash reliably and has some extra bulk.</p>

<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/garchomp.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Garchomp</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Rough Skin<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>This quickly became my favorite member of the team. Garchomp is an amazing revenge killer and with an Adamant nature can hit very hard and still outspeeds everything it needs to. Not only does it work as a revenge killer, a lot of the time it can last mon sweep after everything has been weakened by hazards and by the rest of the team. Another important part that this Garchomp plays is that it's immune to Thundurus' Twave and can kill after Stealth Rock damage.</p>
