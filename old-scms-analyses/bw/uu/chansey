[Overview]

<p>Meet the premier wall and support Pokemon of UU: Chansey. Previously, in DPP UU, Chansey was a strong special wall who could deal with many dangerous special threats, but she was very vulnerable to physical attacks, and she lacked the ability to do much besides walling for residual damage such as Toxic, as her only attack which could deal reasonable damage was Seismic Toss. This, and the fact that she could only use two supporting moves alongside Seismic Toss and her necessary recovery move essentially relegated her to only stall teams, as she was a hindrance to other team styles due to her lack of offensive capability. While some of these traits, such as her lack of offense, haven't changed, BW has given Chansey numerous boons to skyrocket her towards the throne as UU's best all-around wall; in particular, Eviolite makes Chansey absurdly bulky, both specially and physically. This isn't all that BW has given her; Wish now heals the recipient 50% of the user's HP, and because Chansey has such a huge HP stat, it is almost guaranteed that the recipient will be restored to full health. With both of these two qualities in mind, it is no wonder that Chansey is such a top-tier threat in the UU metagame.</p>

<p>That being said, it is necessary to account for Chansey's drawbacks before simply slapping her onto any team. Her lack of offensive presence makes it relatively easy to set up on her; while in some cases Thunder Wave and Toxic can help make up for this, Chansey's low Speed forces her to hit threatening Pokemon with those moves on the switch, and Seismic Toss does not provide enough damage output to break opposing defensive Pokemon. Moves such as Taunt, Substitute, (though keep in mind that either 101 HP Substitutes or a Ghost typing is necessary to stop Seismic Toss from breaking them constantly) and Rest can make Chansey's attempts at wearing down the opponent futile. Furthermore, the fact that Chansey is forced to hold an Eviolite means that she is heavily crippled by moves such as Trick and Knock Off, and she lacks that nice 6.25% of HP healing each turn from Leftovers, which other walls appreciate. Even with these drawbacks, though, Chansey is arguably the best counter to specially offensive threats in UU such as Raikou, Houndoom, Nidoking, and Zapdos, and her ability to support and wall is essentially unmatched in the tier. Make no mistake, Chansey is a huge defensive threat, and it would be unwise to not be prepared for her.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With her outstanding HP and her amazing Eviolite-boosted defenses, Chansey is perhaps the best user of Wish in UU. With full investment in HP EVs, Chansey reaches a whopping HP stat of 704, which allows her to support her team with massive Wishes. Additionally, Wish, alongside Protect, helps increase Chansey's longevity, because in tandem, they essentially form a reliable 50% HP recovery move. Protect also helps rack up damage from poison, which Chansey can spread with ease, and Protect also helps scout for some troublesome moves such as Trick. However, in some cases, Protect isn't really ideal, as it means that Chansey is forced to use up two whole turns to heal herself, which can be taken advantage of if the opponent predicts properly. If you feel that Protect isn't the best option, Softboiled is an alternative to give Chansey a reliable, one-turn recovery move to stop the opponent from trying to set up while she uses Protect. Due to Chansey's pathetic offensive stats, Seismic Toss is her best method for dealing damage, and it does a fair amount of damage to offensive Pokemon. In the last slot, Toxic is recommended as Chansey can easily stall out the opponent with her amazing defenses alongside Wish and Protect.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread is designed to buff Chansey's weaker Defense stat as much as possible. With 252 HP and 252 Def EVs, Chansey is capable of surviving even the strongest of physical attacks. In fact, Chansey is so bulky with this EV spread that she is not even OHKOed by a max Attack Heracross's Close Combat while she is at full health, which is definitely an impressive feat. Alternatively, you can use an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD to capitalize on Eviolite's boosts, but this is less efficient overall, and it makes Chansey's Wishes heal less. A Calm nature is also a viable option to make Chansey even more resilient against special attacks, but more often than not, a Calm nature isn't worth it, as Chansey can already sponge most special attacks with ease, and she really needs the extra Defense granted from a Bold nature. Regardless of the defensive EV spread used, Thunder Wave is a decent alternative over Toxic to allow Chansey to stop sweepers in their tracks.</p>

<p>This variant of Chansey works particularly well with two types of Pokemon: defensive Pokemon who lack a reliable form of recovery, and offensive Pokemon who appreciate having a second chance to tear through the opposing team. Empoleon, Blastoise, and Hitmontop are good examples of the former, while Arcanine, Cobalion, Golurk, and Mismagius are great examples of the latter. The aforementioned defensive teammates are also helpful teammates to Chansey, as the former can phaze Pokemon attempting to set up on Chansey, while the latter three can Rapid Spin away entry hazards which can be irritating for Chansey. Due to Chansey's lack of Leftovers recovery, entry hazards can be a huge hindrance as they can leave her vulnerable to be 2HKOed or OHKOed by attacks which she would otherwise be able to survive. While Chansey can assist offensive Pokemon, it is usually better to use her on stall or balanced teams, as she can actually disrupt the offensively oriented team's momentum. It is on defensive teams where Chansey truly shines, as she can pass huge Wishes to her teammates, and her teammates will be able to deal with her threats. For example, if a Golurk tries to come in and set up a Substitute as Chansey uses Wish, Chansey can switch to a defensive teammate who can take the incoming attack, let the Wish heal off the damage, and proceed to wall Golurk. Situations like these are actually fairly common due to Chansey's lack of offensive power. However, if you have a plethora of defensive teammates to check most of the Pokemon who may try to set up on Chansey, she can become quite an annoyance to the opponent.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Though Chansey is no slouch when it comes to supporting the team, she is particularly useful for performing clerical duties due to her massive bulk. Couple this with a reliable recovery move in Softboiled, and she becomes a highly resilient support Pokemon. Seismic Toss inflicts reasonable damage to Pokemon with a low base HP stat who attempt stop Chansey from performing her supportive duties, while the last slot gives Chansey yet another support option to help her team. Thunder Wave is usually the better choice since paralysis helps Chansey cripple some fast sweepers who would otherwise be troublesome. However, Toxic is also a decent choice to cripple some walls who can be hard to overcome. Also, because Chansey is so bulky, she can stall some opposing Pokemon out with Toxic.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This EV spread allows Chansey to take physical attacks most easily. Chansey can already take special attacks easily enough, so any more investment into Special Defense would be unnecessary. As far as alternative options for this set go, Wish can be used in the last slot to allow Chansey to heal her teammate's health. It should be noted, though, that Aromatherapy is illegal alongside Wish, so Heal Bell must be used instead if you opt to run Wish.</p>

<p>This variant of Chansey works particularly well with Pokemon who use Rest, such as Suicune. Due to BW's new sleep mechanics, Rest becomes significantly riskier. Chansey, however, can ease the risk factor, as she can easily remove the status infliction via Aromatherapy or Heal Bell. You can allow the Pokemon to fully heal itself with Rest, and then switch to Chansey to wake it up. Chansey also pairs well with sweepers and bulky walls who fear status, such as Aerodactyl, Azelf, Crobat, Mismagius, Raikou, Milotic, Slowbro, Hitmontop, and Golurk. What otherwise would be severely crippling status effects can be removed by Chansey's Aromatherapy, thus allowing these Pokemon to do their jobs at their full potential once more.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Chansey has a superb offensive movepool, but unfortunately, her pitiful offenses stop her from being able to utilize it. Moves such as Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Calm Mind are useless on Chansey as her Special Attack will never reach decent enough levels to actually damage other Pokemon significantly. However, Chansey does have one way to do decent damage in Counter. Because of Chansey's gargantuan HP stat and pathetic Defense, any physical attack that hits Chansey will likely take out a ton of HP, allowing Counter to do massive damage with proper prediction. Keep in mind though that once Chansey has used Counter, the opponent will be more wary of striking Chansey with a physical attack.</p>

<p>In terms of support, Chansey has a plethora of moves which can be used with varying success depending your team's needs. Chansey does have access to Stealth Rock, and due to her fantastic bulk, is usually able to set it up with ease. However, do note that Chansey should really only be used to set up Stealth Rock if you have nothing else on your team that can set it up, as Stealth Rock can be used on a wide range of Pokemon, and is a waste of her moveslot which could fit other great support options. Chansey is also a decent user of Rain Dance, Sunny Day, Gravity, Light Screen, and Reflect due to her massive bulk. Chansey is especially good at setting up Light Screen and Reflect, as she also has Healing Wish to fully restore one of your sweepers. Finally, while the following are gimmicky options at best, Chansey can use Snatch to prevent herself from being set up on, and Charm to prevent physical attackers from beating her.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Though Eviolite has made Chansey so bulky that even some physical attackers are unable to defeat her, stronger physical attackers can still prey on her pitiful base Defense of 5. Fighting-types such as Heracross, Hitmontop, Cobalion, and Mienshao boast strong Fighting-type STAB moves to hit Chansey hard. Additionally, Chansey has to trade Leftovers for Eviolite, so entry hazards can whittle her down and stop her from walling some physical attackers. With a bit of prior damage, Victini, Mamoswine, Azumarill, and Arcanine are capable of 2HKOing her. Golurk also deserves a special mention, as he is immune to both Seismic Toss and Thunder Wave, so he can switch in without fear to set up a Substitute and hit whatever that comes in hard with Focus Punch. Chansey is also set up bait for Pokemon with Taunt, Substitute (if said Pokemon is a Ghost-type or has 404 HP or more), or the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk. Examples of these include Mismagius, Chandelure, Mew, Milotic, Suicune, and Snorlax. You can also heavily cripple Chansey by using Trick or Knock Off, as Eviolite is what allows her to take hits so well. Keep in mind, however, that Chansey still has fairly good bulk, even without Eviolite, so know that she might still prove to be a nuisance.</p>
