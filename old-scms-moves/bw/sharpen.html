<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sharpen is a horrible move. It has incredibly limited distribution, being only known by the Porygon line and Cryogonal. None of the four Pokemon with access to Sharpen should ever bother with a physical attacking set, as they all have low Attack stats. Porygon2 should stick with being an offensive wall, Porygon-Z should stick with being a special sweeper, and Cryogonal should stick with being a specially defensive Rapid Spin user.</p>
