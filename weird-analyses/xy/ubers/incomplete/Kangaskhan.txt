    Lack of resistances to come in.


Power-Up Punch
########
name: Power-Up Punch
move 1: Power-Up Punch
move 2: Return
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Earthquake / Fire Punch / Crunch
ability: Scrappy (Parental Bond)
item: Kangaskhanite
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

    Power-Up Punch acts as a pseudo Swords Dance that causes damage and is as powerful as Brick Break.
    Return is devastating, being able to 2HKO Lugia 99.6% of the time with SR and Leftovers at +2.
    Sucker Punch mitigates Speed issues that Mega Kangaskhan has, and allows it to pick off weakened foes, along with Mega Mewtwo Y and other various Psychic- and Ghost-tpyes.
    Earthquake can be used to nail Steel-types and also allows you to beat Arceus-Rock, while Fire Punch allows you to break through Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Scizor.
    Crunch does a ton too Giratina, but it is very redundant alongside Sucker Punch.


Set Details
========

    EVs maximize power and Speed.
    Adamant or Jolly, it is all up to your decision, if you don't mind less Speed and want more power, go for Adamant, but if you find yourself wanting to get a jump on other Kangaskhans and Kyogres, then go for Jolly.
    Scrappy allows you to hit Giratina on the switch with Power-Up Punch, then do a ton to them with Crunch.


Usage Tips
========

    Kangaskhan should never stay in on anything with Will-O-Wisp, ever.
    Kangaskhan should wait to Mega Evolve when the opponent has a Giratina, as you can smack them with Power-Up Punch and proceed to pick them off with Crunch.
    Kangaskhan


Team Options
========

    Heal Bell support is great, because if you do get caught with a burn, you'll want to get it away if you can, a nice user of this is Sylveon, who covers Kangaskhan's weakness to Fighting-types.
    Defensive Xerneas is great, as it performs like Sylveon, but cannot pass Wishes to keep Sylveon healthy.
    Ghost-types, such as Giratina and Arceus-Ghost are great to sponge Fighting-type attacks that put a halt to its sweep.
    A great offensive partner is Ekiller Arceus, as it appreciates the removal of Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress, while Arceus picks off Blaziken and can revenge kill a weakened Xerneas before it kills Kangaskhan.
    Kangaskhan needs SR support as it secures a lot of OHKOes, for example, it secures the OHKO on Groudon, Giratina, and secures the 2HKO on Lugia.
    Sticky Web support is very helpful, as Mega Kangaskhan is not the fastest, but there isn't really any good user in Ubers.
    Kangaskhan appreciates Baton Pass support from Blaziken, but it is not necessary, as it is already powerful enough, but if you can get Kangaskhan to +1 Spe / +2 Atk, you can say gg then and there.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Return
move 2: Fake Out
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Earthquake / Crunch
ability: Scrappy (Parental Bond)
item: Kangaskhanite
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

    Fake Out allows you to revenge kill weakened foes and allows you a turn to Mega Evolve and get a new Speed tier
    Return is the mandatory STAB move, plowing through anything not immune or resistant to it.
    Sucker Punch, in conjunction with Fake Out gives Khan the ability to pick off weakened threats and serves as a kind of revenge killer.
    Earthquake hits Ferrothorn without taking Iron Barbs damage, while also hitting the many Steel-types in Ubers such as Dialga, Arceus-Steel, and Mega Scizor
    Crunch nails Giratina on the switch, but does have redundant coverage alongside Sucker Punch, but it eases prediction against slower foes.


Set Details
========

    EVs maximize power and Speed.
    Adamant or Jolly, it is all up to your decision, if you don't mind less Speed and want more power, go for Adamant, but if you find yourself wanting to get a jump on other Kangaskhans and Kyogres, then go for Jolly.
    Scrappy allows you to hit Giratina on the switch with Return or Crunch and then proceed to muscle through them.


Usage Tips
========

    Fake Out allows Kangaskhan space to Mega Evolve and can hit Mega Gengar and Giratina before it Mega Evolves.
    Try to never keep Khan in on any Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp
    On anything that likely carries Rocky Helmet, or has Rough Skin or Iron Barbs, keep it out of there, as it will take double that damage.
    This Mega Kangaskhan is best used as a revenge killer and to punch holes.


Team Options
========

    Ho-oh is a nice partner, as it can break down Steel-types, while also being immune to Burn.
    Yveltal can handle Lugia, along with Ghost-types, that give Khan trouble.
    Kyogre and Shaymin-Sky both work well, as they can muscle through Rock Arceus.


Other Options
########

    Fake Out is nice for coming in and picking off a weakened foe, but it is generally just a filler.
    Seismic Toss deals 200 damage every time, allowing it to 2HKO pretty much everything no matter what unless they're Ghost.
    Roar is a niche move, but it can get rid of stuff Khan doesn't like, but it requires massively good prediction, but it is generally a waste of a slot.
    Substitute turns it into a huge threat, as it can now take on Will-O-Wisp users.
    Drain Punch gives you reliable recovery.
    A Defensive set of Wish / Protect / Seismic Toss / Knock Off can be used, with an Impish / Careful nature, but this is generally left better to other Pokemon.
    252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe gives you a lot more bulk, but the loss of Speed is very unappealing.
    Toxic slams support Arceus
    Body Slam does have a nice ~50% chance to paralyze, but it is often to weak.
    Double-Edge is insanely powerful, but it also comes with very heavy recoil.
    Lastly, Facade is an option, as it takes advantage of Burn, but if it isn't burned, then it is often too weak to be used.

Checks & Counters
########

    Mega Lucario, Mega Mewtwo X, and Terrakion can all pick off Kangaskhan with their STABs.
    Giratina and Sableye both can Will-O-Wisp it and take nothing from any of Kang's moves bar Earthquake, but they have to be wary of Crunch.
    Skarmory can faze it, but takes huge damage from Fire Punch in the process.
    Arceus-Rock walls any set lacking Earthquake
    Darkrai can put it to sleep and hit it with Focus Blast, however, Darkrai cannot live a Return and Focus Blast has low accuracy and doesn't OHKO it, but it does leave it in a very low health range to be killed off by anything that is faster and resists Sucker Punch or any priority user.
    Support Arceus formes are good checks, as they can just burn Kangakshan and stall it out.
    Lugia without Power-Up Punch + Crunch
    Mega Scizor / Ferrothorn / Skarmory / Bronzong if you lack Crunch or Fire Punch.
    Dialga walls any Kangaskhan lacking Earthquake.
    Physically Defensive Yvetlal is a full stop.
    Mega Gengar plays mind games with Destiny Bond and can avoid Sucker Punch if played correctly.
    Sableye, while rare, can burn Kangaskhan, while taking nothing from its other attacks.
