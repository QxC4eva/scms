[Overview]

<p>Simisear might seem inferior to Charizard, but his base 101 Speed and access to Nasty Plot allow him to distance himself from his competition. With these tools at his disposal, Simisear can be an impressive setup sweeper. As entry hazards are so prevalent in NU, Simisear needs team support to perform well, which deters many from using him. Don't be fooled though, as Simisear has many redeeming qualities. His STAB Fire Blast is satisfyingly powerful, and he gets Grass Knot for all of the Water- and Rock-types tearing through NU. Additionally, he outspeeds the majority of the NU tier. Simisear might not be top banana, but he's a great choice if your team needs a straightforward, no-fuss sweeper.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Simisear just got his nails done, so a physical attacking set is out of the question. After one Nasty Plot, his Special Attack will reach 588 and he will become more powerful than almost every other special attacker in NU. The premise of this set is fairly simple: boost and sweep. If you remove entry hazards and maybe give him a little Wish support, your opponent's Pokemon will be dropping like flies. Fire Blast is extremely powerful, dealing huge amounts of damage to some of NU's top walls. Lickilicky, for example, is OHKOed with Stealth Rock damage factored in. Simisear greatly appreciates his access to Grass Knot, as it frees up his Hidden Power. Simisear has great coverage with Fire Blast, Grass Knot, and Hidden Power Ground, a combination only resisted by Altaria, Pelipper, and Mantine in NU. Grass Knot deals with Water- and Rock-types such as Seismitoad, Regirock, and Golem, while Hidden Power Rock nails other Fire-types, such as Charizard and Rapidash, as well as Altaria.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Simisear must run a Timid nature or he risks being outsped by common NU Pokemon such as Miltank and Haunter. Life Orb is used to net additional KOs, such as Regirock. If you dislike Life Orb recoil, Expert Belt is a great alternative; with entry hazard support, the power difference is barely noticeable. Spikes support is excellent for Simisear, as it allows him to eke out a KO on Pokemon that might survive his boosted attacks. Gurdurr is a prime example; it can survive a boosted Fire Blast and Drain Punch Simisear in return, but with Spikes down, it's easily dispatched. Simisear is vulnerable to residual damage, so Rapid Spin support is crucial to his success. Wartortle and Armaldo are excellent for this support role. Miltank can cause problems for Simisear, as Thick Fat allows it to resist Fire Blast, and it is bulky enough to tank his coverage moves. Focus Blast OHKOes the cow easily, and still covers Fire-types: a neutral Focus Blast is only slightly weaker than a super effective Hidden Power Ground.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set's biggest boon comes in its surprise factor. Simisear is not the most common Pokemon in NU, and opponents will probably expect him to be a Nasty Plot variant. Thus, a 140 Base Power STAB Overheat off 441 Special Attack will definitely catch your opponent off-guard. The move is quite powerful, and Simisear's base 101 Speed gives him a huge advantage, allowing him to outspeed almost every unboosted Pokemon in NU. Grass Knot will really do a number on Seismitoad and other Water / Ground types. Flamethrower is a reliable backup STAB move that Simisear can use to power through the opponent's team late-game, and is vital for situations where a single Overheat won't do. Fire Blast is an alternative to Flamethrower, but its lower accuracy might leave something to be desired.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Timid nature is mandatory, as Simisear will otherwise find himself outpaced by prominent NU attackers such as Haunter. Entry hazard support is an excellent idea for Simisear, as he forces switches rather well, and the damage can help him secure KOs. Conversely, entry hazards on Simisear's side of the battlefield are going to make life very difficult for him, as he will be switching constantly due to Choice Specs. Rapid Spin users such as Wartortle or Armaldo are lifesavers, and will make Simisear much harder to handle. Focus Blast is an option over Hidden Power Ground if you need to deal with Miltank, who resists Overheat thanks to Thick Fat, and can tank Simisear's other moves.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Simisear does not have many other useful options. A Choice Scarf set is decent, but somewhat outclassed by Charizard with its far stronger attacking power. Substitute can replace Hidden Power Rock on the Nasty Plot set, and is quite useful for blocking status, checking faster Pokemon, and mitigating priority. Simisear will find it much easier to sweep while behind a Substitute, and can KO threats that would otherwise outspeed and KO, such as Swellow and Choice Scarf Rotom-S.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Stealth Rock is a real problem for Simisear, so keeping the entry hazards down can really put a damper on his sweep. Faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users can take advantage of Simisear's frailty, while Pokemon such as Rotom-S, Swellow, and Tauros can KO the monkey with ease. Priority is also a problem with two powerful Aqua Jet users in the tierâ€”Samurott and Carracosta. Cacturne might not be able to switch in, but Sucker Punch can KO Simisear easily. Altaria resists every attack Simisear uses except Hidden Power Rock and can threaten a KO with Earthquake. Bulky Fire-types are a problem for Simisear as well. Camerupt has enough bulk to survive an attack and KO with Earth Power, respectively. Miltank, with the right set, is an absolute nightmare for Simisear. It resists Fire Blast, can threaten with paralysis, and even set up Stealth Rock. Additionally, Miltank has access to Milk Drink to stall Simisear for Life Orb recoil as well, then KO with Body Slam.</p>
