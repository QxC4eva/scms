Randomly disables an opponent's move for 0-6 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prevents a random move of the target from being used again for 0-6 turns. Only one move per target can be Disabled. Fails if one of the target's moves is already Disabled. If the target is using Rage, trying to hit it with Disable will build up its rage whether it hits or not. Ignores a target's Substitute.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Disable is great in later generations, but it simply does not cut it in RBY. You have no control on the move Disabled whatsoever, the Disable might last just that very same turn, and its accuracy is terrible. It's thus not recommended to use this move in competitive battling at all.</p>
