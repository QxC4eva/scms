<p>Welcome, everyone, to the third installment of Recently in Tournaments. Without wasting our precious time, let's move on to the real stuff.</p>

<h3>Smogon Grand Slam 3</h3>

<img src="/tournaments/grandslam/grandslamlogo1.png" alt="" />

<p>The Smogon Grand Slam is a one-of-a-kind tournament where players compete in six separate opens to earn points. Each open hosts a different tier, namely Ubers, UU, RU, NU, LC and Doubles. With the introduction of Doubles to the tournament, some changes were made to the ruleset. The players can only play 5 out of the 6 opens. The eight combatants that earn the most points advance to the final bracket, where they compete in best of fives until one player remains to claim the prestigious cyan trophy <img src="/media/forums/images/badges/grandslam.png.v.ffhlCIEmUjfOijiUxo_MkA" alt="" />. You can keep track of the top eight by visiting <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fCPPaPZDplpETE6lxGqo9gqin4YmmbdYvZeGoWqIO68/edit?pli=1#gid=511719574">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>All the opens are still going on, and the participants are still trying as hard as they can for the top 8 spots. You can keep track of the happenings of the different opens through their forum threads, which can all be found <a href="/forums/forums/smogon-grand-slam.208/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The World Cup of Pok&eacute;mon, one of Smogon's two official team tournaments, is one of the most prestigious events in online Pok&eacute;mon. Sixteen regions from all over the world compete in the first round, where the top eight teams are decided. After being placed in a bracket, the remaining eight teams go head to head until one comes out on top. The winning team, starters and substitutes alike, are awarded the iconic dark blue trophy <img src="/media/forums/images/badges/worldcup.png.v.tm1Sb2BOAWMC7NZO78pI0g" alt="" />.</p>
 
<p>Last year US East showed a dominating performance, beating Asia in the finals 5-2. Considered the heavy favorites this year, East made nothing but improvements to their winning roster, adding Sinclair, PDC, and aim, all considered excellent players in XY OU. Showing no signs of slipping up, East finished group stages as the number one seed with an impressive 18-6 record. Three games behind East with a solid 15-9, we found US West, who improved last year's roster by adding reyscarface, Dice, Ben Gay, fingerscrossed and Valentine. At 14-10 we had three capable teams, namely US Metro, Germany, and Spain. The remaining three teams, Brazil, Asia, and Canada, all managed to get by groups with 13-11 records.</p>

<p>After seeding was determined, these eight teams were placed in the Quarterfinal bracket. East, as expected, was the team with the most impressive performance, beating out Canada 6-2. The other Quarterfinal victors, West, Brazil, and Spain, were victorious over Asia, Metro, and Germany respectively, with 5-3 records. In the next round, East crushed their Semifinal opponents, Spain, 7-1 and started to prepare for the finals. In a back and forth series, Brazil was able pull off the upset, eliminating the second seed, US West, 5-3.</p>

<p>Hill lost, BlueStar won the second, Destiny Device won another, Dekzeh lost, HANTSUKI won, Kratos won, Malfoy lost, Sogeking won the last.</p>

In the game 1 of finals, Haruno's rain team was unable to break through Lohgock's Escavalier. In the second game, Haruno was put at early disadvantage by Lohgock's Weakness Policy Tyranitar, which resulted in Haruno's Mega Kangaskhan and Kyurem-B getting substantially weakened and Haruno could not recover from this. Thus, Lohgock won the finals.

<h4>GSCielebi tournament</h4>
 
<p>This tournament is a standard GSC OU tournament with a little twist: Celebi is allowed to be used in it. The fianls were to be contested between Isa, e7e, and Conflict. Funnily though, each of them won a match each, with Isa beating conflict, Conflict beating e7e and e7e in return beating Isa. In the 2nd round of finals, e7e managed to beat both Isa and Conflict to become the champion.</p> 
 
<h4>The Quite Literally Perfect BW UU tournament</h4>

<p>This tournament was a standard BW UU tournament, but with Abomasnow, Snover, Chandelure, and Victini banned. Whitequeen, Nas, and calloflochie were in finals. Nas, also known as RT and considered to be one of the best BW UU players, defeated both of his opponents to clinch the win.</p>
 
<p>Along with these, Fuk Fairies Tournament is in finals to be contested between Level 56 and Lily. The Bracket tournament is also in its final stage. FLCL and Typhlito are going to contest for the title. The Sunset Colloseum tournament, which is based on the sunset colloseum&mdash;a game mode in Pok&eacute;mon Battle Revolution is also in finals&mdash;is to be fought between TGMD and complete legitimacy. Apart from these, valmanway is hosting the ORAS celebration tour. Only those Pok&eacute;mon, who were found in the Original Hoeen game trio- Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald are allowed to be used, but the mechanics are XY. So, if you loved those games and are waiting for the remakes, sign up for this tournament. Until next time, happy battling.</p>
