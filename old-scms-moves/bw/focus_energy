<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's critical hit rate by two stages. Can be passed by Baton Pass.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Focus Energy should not be used competitively. Aiming for critical hits is an ineffective strategy, as the critical hit ratio will still be quite low, and the boosts cannot be stacked. Furthermore, your Pokemon may struggle to find a free moveslot, or free turn, for Focus Energy.</p>
