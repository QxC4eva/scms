<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises the power of Rock-type moves 20% when holding this item.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In battle, Hard Stone performs almost exactly like <a href="/dp/items/rock_incense">Rock Incense</a>. The only difference is how these items affect the Base Power of the move <a href="/dp/moves/fling">Fling</a>; Rock Incense makes Fling's Base Power 10 while Hard Stone makes it 30. Due to this, Rock Incense is marginally better (unless the Pokemon holding it uses Fling) because opponents employing the extremely rare Trick/Thief + Fling strategy will deal slightly less damage when they Fling your item. For information on the competitive use of this item, see the Rock Incense description.</p>
