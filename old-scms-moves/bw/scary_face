Lowers target's Speed by 2 stages.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Speed by two stages. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Speed is an important stat, to be sure, but lowering an opponent's Speed with Scary Face isn't the best idea. The opponent can simply switch out to remove the effects of Scary Face, unlike the permanent effects of paralysis. Not to mention that Scary Face would probably need to be used as the opponent switches in, lest the user face a powerful hit in return.</p>
