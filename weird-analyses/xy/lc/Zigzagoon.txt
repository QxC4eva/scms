Overview
########
- Zigzagoon is the only Pokemon in Little Cup gifted with the rare Belly Drum + Extreme Speed combination
- This allows it sweep with +2 priority with a maximized Attack stat
- However, its movepool is relatively sparse which doesn't allow many coverage options
- It is also quite slow, which means that things that resist Extreme Speed can easily revenge kill Zigzagoon

Belly Drum
########
name: Belly Drum
move 1: Belly Drum
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Thief
move 4: Protect / Rock Smash / Iron Tail 
ability: Pickup
item: Berry Juice
evs: 132 HP / 196 Atk / 28 Def / 108 SpD / 36 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Belly Drum is used to quadruple Zigzagoon's Attack, giving it an  effective 52 Attack stat; this allows it to OHKO the majority of the  tier.
- Extreme Speed is Zigzagoon's main STAB move; it is powerful and it  has a priority of +2, which means it is almost always guaranteed to go  first, and it does massive damage to anything at +6.
- Thief for Misdreavus without Hidden Power Fighting and Tirtouga, will elaborate more in analysis. Thief allows it to beat Misdreavus without Hidden Power Fighting if it's at 50%, and it steals Tirtouga's Berry Juice allowing it to take it on 1v1.
- Lots of options for last move. Seed Bomb hits Tirtouga, Onix, and other Rock-types. Rock Smash helps with Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Lileep. Iron Tail hits Spritzee (who survives Extreme Speed) and Lileep and other Rock-types. Protect helps stop Fake Out users such as Aipom, Mienfoo, and Meditite. 


Set Details
========
- The EV spread maximizes Zigzagoon's Attack, while also allowing it  to survive a Misdreavus's Dazzling Gleam 94% of the time at 50% health,  while also letting it live through a Fletchling's 110 BP Acrobatics at 100%.  The rest is invested in Speed, which allows it to outspeed Jolly Tirtouga.
- Pickup is convenient to obtain more Berry Juices; while a rare occurence, it is still helpful in some situations
- Berry Juice is to heal back to 100% health after a Belly Drum.

Usage Tips
========

- Zigzagoon is one of those Pokemon with limited mid-game use but incredible late-game power. It can be used as a revenge killer for very weak Pokemon with an unboosted Extreme Speed but almost everything can force it out so its not recommended. 
- Zigzagoon is best used late in the game when the opponent's counters are weakened or gone, and the opponent sends out a Pokemon that can't otherwise hurt Zigzagoon enough to stop set up. 

Team Options
========

- Stealth Rock or Spikes are necessary to remove Sturdy or Focus Sash. 
- Reflect, Light Screen, Encore, Safeguard and Memento greatly aid Zigzagoon in its setting up. 
- It needs help with some of its counters. Pursuit users such as Pawniard or Houndour help in removing Ghost-types. Houndour can also weaken opposing Rock-types with its wall-breaking capabilities. 
- Knock Off support from Mienfoo or Pawniard also help, as even at +6 Zigzagoon struggles to KO really bulky mons such as Vullaby and Spritzee.
- Zigzagoon appreciates the use of lures such as Heat Wave Vullaby to weaken counters such as Pawniard.


Other Options
########
- Gluttony + Salac Berry + 196 Atk / 28 Def / 28 SpD / 196 Spe. This set uses Gluttony to get to +6,+1 straight away, allowing it to outspeed all unboosted Pokemon. This really helps against things such as Misdreavus who it can now outspeed and hit with thief.
- Gunk Shot will OHKO Spritzee with a slightly greater accuracy than Iron Tail. 

Checks & Counters
########
- **Ghost-types**: Resisting Extremespeed and usually outspeed, Misdreavus, Gastly and Drifloon can all give Zigzagoon trouble.
- **Rock-types**: Rock-types resist Extremespeed and can usually deal good damage to Zigzagoon as it is quite frail. Examples include Lileep, Tirtouga and Onix.
- **Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Pawniard resist Extremespeed and can hit back hard.
- **Fake Out**: If Zigzagoon is not carrying Protect, Fake Out Pokemon are very annoying as it usually cannot set up and remain at full health.
