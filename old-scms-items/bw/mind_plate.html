<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that increases the Base Power of all Psychic-type moves by 20%. When held by a Pokemon with the Multitype ability, the holder's type will change to Psychic.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Looked down upon by some, Psychic Arceus is actually surprisingly capable. It is usually seen as a weaker, slower Mewtwo, and this is true to an extent&mdash;but Psychic Arceus has far superior defenses, allowing it to make better use of Calm Mind while blasting through special walls with Psyshock. Psychic Arceus can also be made to counter Mewtwo effectively, able to take any hit with relative ease aside from a sun-boosted Fire Blast. However, Psychic Arceus doesn't have a lot of resistances it can take advantage of, one of the reasons why it is usually passed up.</p>

<p>However, it is generally useless aside from Arceus, as most other Psychic-types find the power boost from Mind Plate to be too menial.</p>

<h2>Location</h2> 
<p>Abyssal Ruins, 1F.</p>
