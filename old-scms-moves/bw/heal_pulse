[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals the target by 1/2 of its maximum HP, rounded half up. The user of this move cannot also be the target. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Heal Pulse is useless in singles. However, in doubles it can be a great way to keep your partner in prime fighting condition. Ideally, Heal Pulse users should be paired with powerful Pokemon that can dish out strong attacks. Good candidates for this role include Blissey, Latias, and Audino.</p>
