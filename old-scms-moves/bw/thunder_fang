<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to paralyze the target. Has a 10% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Thunder Fang is too weak to use in most situations. It is outclassed by ThunderPunch. Even as a coverage move, it sees little use. The major exception to this rule is Durant, who's movepool leaves much to be desired, and Thunder Fang offers Durant a viable weapon to maim those that resist its STAB combination.</p>
