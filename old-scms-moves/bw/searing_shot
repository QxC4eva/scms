<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to burn the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Searing Shot, one of Victini's signature moves, is a more powerful version of Flamethrower. While it is a usable move on special attacking variants of Victini, the reason Searing Shot does not get much usage is because of Victini's ability, Victory Star. Victory Star brings Fire Blast's shaky accuracy to a rather reasonable level, and the large boost in power from Searing Shot to Fire Blast is enough reason to risk the small chance of Fire Blast missing. Not to mention that Victini also has access to V-create, pushing most special attacking variants of Victini out of the competitive scene.</p>
