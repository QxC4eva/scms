Overview
########

-Access to Stealth Rock and Taunt allows it to sets rocks AND Taunt potential defoggers
-Really good 150 speed allows Aerodactyl to outrun Modest & Adamant base 90 Choice Scarf wielders and Mega Mewtwo-Y...it speed ties with Deoxys-A
-Defensive typing is mediocre but does allow it to check Ho-Oh and avoid Spikes/Sticky Web
-Reasonable offensive movepool including Earthquake, Stone Edge, Aerial Ace, etc.
-Pretty weak attacker by Ubers standards, and Tough Claws does not boost any notable moves
-Frail
-Only useful on offensive teams in need of fast Stealth Rock + Taunt due to lack of power & bulk

Moves
========

-Stealth Rock is mandatory and Aerodactyl can set it up fairly easily due to its high Speed
-Taunt stops the enemy from setting up their own hazards, statusing you, or Defogging Stealth Rock away
-Stone Edge is Aerodactyl's best attacking option and does decent damage (~70-75% to Darkrai, ~30-35% to max HP Arceus). Unfortunately, it does not get a Tough Claws boost
-Earthquake is a good choice to hit troublesome Steel types that wall you otherwise
-Aerial Ace gives Aerodactyl a STAB option, but synergizes poorly with Stone Edge

Set Details
========

-Fire Fang gets a Tough Claws boost and has a small chance to OHKO Ferrothorn and Scizor...situational
-Toxic cripples most Arceus formes and is great against Pokemon like Landorus-T
-Aerodactylite is its best item to increase its speed and longetivity. If you want to use Aerodactyl but already have a Mega Evolution, a Focus Sash lead can work but is largely outclassed by Deoxys-A
-Jolly is preferred to outrun threats like Mega Mewtwo-Y and Modest Scarfogre
-If Aerodactyl chooses to run Toxic, it can run max HP instead of max Attack to take hits a little better. It will still not be alive for very long though

Other Options
########

-Sleep Talk, but has an awful time fitting it and isn't going to get reliable rolls anyway
-Roost for longevity, Aero will rarely find time to use this though
-Pursuit for Mega Gengar and Deoxys-A that try to switch out
-Iron Head/Ice Fang for mediocre coverage moves (latter hits Gliscor)
-Whirlwind can phaze, Tailwind can support team (especially if you use it as a suicide lead)
-Aerodactyl has a good movepool but has a hard time fitting alternative options in
