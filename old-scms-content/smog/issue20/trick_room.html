<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Trick Room teams in OU have always been scoffed at as simply  unviable, and somewhat rightfully so. In a tier where something doesn't  need to  be   slow to take a hit and dish one out, constantly setting up  Trick  Room   has usually proved to be too much of a burden. In lower  tiers,  however,   most offensive threats are either fast and frail or  bulky and slow. Trick Room gives the latter the ability to outspeed and  crush the   former with ease.</p>

<h2>Trick Room in General</h2>

<p>Basically, Trick Room allows the slower Pokemon to move first  in battle (assuming both moves have the same priority). It only lasts  for 5   turns,  including the turn it is set up, and there is no way to  extend   this  time limit. Also, the move itself has -7 priority,  meaning   whatever sets  it up will probably be taking a hit in the  process. For   these reasons,  ideal Trick Room team members are slow  (to be "faster"   under Trick Room;  they thus use Speed-reducing  natures with 0 Speed  IVs and EVs),  powerful (with only 4  turns to  really utilize Trick  Room, you better make each turn count and  hit  HARD), and bulky (as  they will likely be  taking hits outside of Trick  Room). Thankfully,  the lower tiers are  overflowing with wonderful   sweepers that fill that  niche to a tee.</p>

<p>While the sweepers are plentiful, the Trick Room users  themselves aren't    quite as varied. Most happen to be Ghost- or  Psychic-types, which  both   share a weakness to Ghost and Dark; this  can make it somewhat difficult to accommodate sweepers with good  synergy.  Also, priority attacks bypass Trick Room and can   still put  the hurt  on your sweepers (though they're a blessing for your   own  sweepers to  have outside of Trick Room). Taunt, Roar, and Whirlwind    all have  higher priority than the move Trick Room, which can make    setting it up  rather difficult. Also, because Trick Room is so  short-lived, your opponent can stall it out with Substitute, Protect,  and   careful switching. Taunt, multi-hit moves, Substitutes of your  own, and   good prediction can alleviate these issues to some  degree.</p>

<h2>NU</h2>

<p>NU is blessed with some incredibly potent sweepers to use under  Trick    Room, but the users of the move themselves can sometimes leave  a bit to    be desired. Exeggutor is among the best, as its dual Grass /  Psychic   typing allows it to scare off the common Rock- and  Water-types in the   tier and gives it multiple opportunities to  set  up. Once Trick Room is up, it   can fire off powerful Leaf Storms  and  Psychics from its base 125 Special   Attack or simply cripple a   troublesome opponent with Sleep Powder.   Musharna is another great   choice, as its low base 29 Speed,  decent base   107 Special Attack,  and great overall bulk makes it  difficult to take   down, especially  with Moonlight to keep it healthy.  Duosion functions  as  a more  offensive Musharna, sacrificing a bit of  bulk for a higher  base  125  Special Attack and an immunity to passive  damage. The most  offensive   mono-Psychic Trick Room user, however, is  Beheeyem, which  boasts  access  to both Trick Room and Nasty Plot. With  an immunity to  Ghost  and a  neutrality to Dark, Audino is a great  choice for any Trick  Room  team.  With Regenerator and Wish, it can keep  itself and its allies   healthy  throughout the battle. Perhaps its  biggest selling point is   Healing  Wish; at the cost of its own life,  Audino can bring a  battered  sweeper  back in at full health. Lampent's  immunities to  Fire, Fighting,  and  Normal make it a solid choice as  well, and  (despite the shared  Dark and  Ghost weakness) it has pretty  good  synergy with Exeggutor. It  can even  use Memento to cripple an   opponent offensively and get a  sweeper in for  free, although it   sacrifices itself to do so. Finally,  Banette has a  role that most  view  as outdated: suicide lead. After  setting up Trick  Room and  surviving  with a Focus Sash, it can use  Destiny Bond to bring  its foe  down with  it and give your sweeper 3  turns of fun under Trick   Room.</p>

<p>As far as sweepers go, there are plenty of great choices in NU.  Marowak   jumps out as one of the best; its unique item, Thick Club,  can bring its Attack  stat to an incredible 568. EdgeQuake offers solid  coverage,   though  Bonemerang is a less accurate option over Earthquake  due to its    ability to break Substitutes. Recoilless Double-Edge is  also always a   plus. Rampardos offers a similar role, boasting the  highest Attack stat    outside of Deoxys-A. Head Smash hits HARD, and  thanks to Mold Breaker, Earthquake can hit opponents with Levitate.  Gurdurr is a great choice   for a bulky Fighting-type that can take care  of pesky Dark-types with  ease, and it comes fully equipped with useful  priority in the form of   Mach Punch. Cacturne is an effective mixed  sweeper under Trick Room,  and   has access to Spikes; even though it  can be difficult to set up  entry   hazards on a Trick Room team, the  payoff can be wonderful.  Zweilous has the most powerful Outrage in the  game (it is more powerful than even Rayquaza's!)  and,   although  inaccurate, it can punch holes through teams  (especially   considering  the severe lack of Steel-types in NU).  Clamperl surprisingly    functions as a special equivalent to Marowak  with its exclusive    DeepSeaTooth, but its complete  lack of bulk is distressing. If entry    hazards are giving you trouble,  Armaldo is a fantastic offensive  spinner   for Trick Room. Ursaring is a  potent Guts abuser that  functions   extremely well under Trick Room.  The list really goes on  and on in NU, but those are some of the  highlights.</p>

<h2>RU</h2>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue20/trickroom_slowking.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>RU is a tier where Trick Room really triumphs. Not only does it  have    access to all of the wonderful Pokemon listed above, but it has  numerous    stars of its own. Cofagrigus is one of the top Trick Room  users and    sweepers in the tier; with perfect coverage in just two  moves, it can    afford to run a devastating Trick Room + Nasty Plot  set. Slowking can    also run a "Nasty Room" set; or it can even forgo   Nasty Plot in favor of   better coverage. It can also function as a   Trick Room tank; either way,   Regenerator is a wonderful ability for   keeping it healthy throughout  the  battle. Uxie is an amazingly bulky   Trick Room user that offers a  wide  range of support options. Base 95   Speed might be a tad high for  Trick  Room, but it offers Uxie a "slow"   U-turn that lets it tank a hit  before  switching to an appropriate   sweeper. A more offensive option is  Mesprit,  which is not only   threatening after setting up Trick Room, but also able to  use Healing  Wish to give an injured teammate a second shot at  success.  As gimmicky  as it sounds, Lv.  1 Smeargle with Focus Sash,  Spore, Trick  Room,  Endeavor, and Dragon  Rage is a fantastic suicide  lead that often   cripples one opponent,  KOes a second, and sets up Trick  Room with  ease.  Dusknoir is another  bulky, offensive Ghost that  differentiates  itself  from Cofagrigus by  being more physically  inclined. Gallade is a  great  offensive Trick  Room user with useful  priority in Shadow  Sneak, access  to Swords Dance  and Bulk Up, and the  ability Justified,  which boosts its  Attack stat  when hit by a Dark-type  attack (which  are notably  problematic to Trick  Room teams). Although  fast,  Klingklang gets a  mention as the only  Trick Room user that  resists  Dark, and much like  Uxie, it can use its  Speed and bulk under  Trick  Room to take a hit  before switching with  Volt Switch. Finally,   Whimsicott deserves a  mention for its priority  Taunt, preventing   Whirlwind, Roar, and other  Taunt users from shutting  down your Trick   Room team before you get to  set up.</p>

<p>RU also has plenty of solid sweepers. Recoilless STAB Head  Smash coming off of base 110 Attack makes Aggron an instant  winner for  Trick Room. Handy resistances to Dark and Ghost paired with  its great  bulk just   seals the deal. Druddigon is a Dragon that seems  custom  made for Trick   Room: base 48 Speed, base 120 Attack, and even priority  in the form of   Sucker Punch to utilize outside of Trick Room. With  Adaptability,   Crawdaunt's already great Water / Dark STAB becomes even  more potent, and   it also has base 120 Attack to back it up. Like  Aggron, it also resists Dark   and Ghost, and  even hits Ghost-types  super effectively, making it a   great choice for  a Trick Room team.  Rhydon is another wonderful option, with an  impressive base 130 Attack  and STAB EdgeQuake. Throw Megahorn into the  mix and you get flawless  coverage. Bulky Fighting-types are   always  great for dealing with  Dark-types, and in RU, that role goes to    Hariyama; priority Bullet  Punch is another boon. Bouffalant has immunities to Ghost and Grass and  STAB Reckless Head Charge to punish anything that doesn't resist it.  Tangrowth is another slow, bulky sweeper perfectly suited for Trick  Room. With Regenerator to keep it    healthy, the ability to go mixed,  and Sleep Powder to dispatch potential counters, it's a great option to  keep in mind.</p>

<h2>UU</h2>

<p>UU is blessed not only with the aforementioned wonders from RU  and NU, but its own solid Trick Room users and sweepers as well.  Bronzong is perhaps the most prominent; its amazing bulk and resistances  make   switching  it in easy. After setting up Trick Room, it can fire  off   powerful  STAB Gyro Balls before Exploding on a troublesome foe  and   getting an  ally in for free. Cresselia is also a formidable bulky  Trick   Room  user. Its access to the ever useful Healing Wish sets it  apart  from   the pack. With an Eviolite, Porygon2 is extremely  difficult to  take   down without Fighting-type attacks (something its  teammates will  likely   be happy to switch in on). Good base 105  Special Attack and a  wide  range  of offensive and support moves makes  it an excellent choice  for  any  team. Slowbro functions much like  Slowking, but with better   physical  bulk than special. Dusclops is a  similarly upgraded version of   an RU;  while less offensive than  Dusknoir, it offers much greater  bulk  thanks  to Eviolite. Meanwhile,  Chandelure is essentially a far  greater  and more  offensive Lampent.  Victini, although quite fast with  base 100  Speed,  can set up Trick  Room and decrease its own Speed with a   powerful STAB   V-Create.</p>

<p>There are quite a few good Trick Room sweepers in UU as well.  Escavalier    is like a bulkier Scizor in Trick Room, with powerful STAB  Megahorn   and  Iron Head for tearing into the foe. Rhyperior is  essentially a more   powerful Rhydon with an actually usable ability.  Snorlax is along-time   OU veteran that  still functions as a great  offensive tank under Trick Room.   With Huge  Power, Azumarill's Attack  stat can reach an incredible 654   (even  higher than Deoxys-A's!). STAB  priority  in Aqua Jet makes it a   fierce combatant even after Trick  Room's timer  runs out. No Guard   Machamp is annoying as ever with its  100% accurate,  confusion-inducing   STAB DynamicPunch. Under Trick  Room, it guarantees  any non-Ghost   opponent has just a 50% chance of  even hitting it.  Access to perfect   accuracy Stone Edge, Earthquake,  the elemental  punches, and priority   Bullet Punch makes Machamp a  surprisingly  versatile threat. Bisharp is   another solid asset to  Trick Room teams  in UU; its 4x resistances to   Dark and Ghost are  exactly what the  doctor ordered! STAB priority Sucker   Punch and  access to Swords Dance  is no laughing matter, either.</p>
