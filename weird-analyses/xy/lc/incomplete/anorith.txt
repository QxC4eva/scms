Overview
########

Say hello to Anorith, the bug with a fug mug only a thug could love. Our bug eyed beauty from the sea is a lot more powerful than it's rather fragile appearance gives away. With a stellar base attack stat at 95, a sweet speed stat that allows it to comfortably reach 18, our ancient anthropod isn't going to be sent back to the stone age so easily. It can pull off a surprising sweeping set, to a revenge killing scarfer, or even an offensive rapid spinner disruptor set. It's movepool, while limited, can often do the job it needs to do and punch holes with it's combination of power and speed. 

However, with a weakness to stealth rock, and most priority, while only having below average bulk and defenses keeps Anorith from being the all star it could very well be. It's limited movepool holds it back too, as fighting types singlehandedly resist both it's stabs and typically carry a rock move to dispatch of it swiftly. Lastly, it's rock/bug typing only gives it a whopping 2 resistances, and weaknesses to rock, water, and steel, all of which are very lethal and prominent in little cup.

Take care with and against this aqua shrimp, and it'll pay off brilliantly for your team or it'll pinch your team to pieces before you know it.


SET NAME
########
name: Support Shrimp
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Rock Blast
move 3: Knock Off / Brick Break
move 4: Stealth Rock
ability: Battle Armor
item: Focus Sash / Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 236 Attack / 36 Defense / 236 Speed
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Rapid spin is to rapid spin hazards.

Rock blast is to break focus sashes and sturdy.

Knock off is to remove precious items since they are so precious in a precious metagame.

Brick break can break screens the enemy sets up although that is rare but also hits steel and normal types pretty good.

Stealth Rock is stealth rock, very useful.

Set Details
========

The EVs are simply the best, especially for a lead Anorith. With Jolly, Anorith can defeat most hazard layers speed wise and ko them, or set up it's own before ko'ing and then removing the hazards. As a bonus, since most defoggers are weak to rock, it can eliminate them as well. Rock blast is no laughing matter coming off of 19 Attack, after all. Each item has it's own purpose; focus sash is great to lead with, ensuring that Anorith will get at least one layer of hazards or attack off, eviolite is to patch up it's poor defenses a bit, and berry juice can let anorith switch in multiple times to spin rocks, as it has no recovery of it's own. Battle Armor prevents random ass crits that everyone hates, which is good.

Usage Tips
========

Solid lead, especially against dwebble. Useful cleaner too when most priority is gone, since it's quite fast and powerful, excellent revenge killer if you keep the sash intact. It can also beat Natu if it tries to be funny and block it's hazards; defog users were mentioned already but again, they can be dealt with easily. Only a few stand a chance against this bug; rapid spinners are what anorith has to watch out for. Drilbur is powerful and bulky, with stab EQ, starmie and tentacool are water types and don't mind flushing anorith away.

Team Options
========

Anything that appreciates hazards on the enemy side of the field to clutch KOs loves our shrimp, and non-abra focus sashers / sturdy mons. Pawniard is noted as, if a defogger comes in it can easily take advantage of a +2 boost if it defogs, resists rock and steel while being neutral to water. Magnemite is equally good, resisting rock and steel while having a stab to murder water types. Since it's a lead, it can be pretty disruptive with knock off, softening up pokes it can't KO for revenge killers to do away with, as well as softening walls that would otherwise shrug off such attacks. A pokemon that defeats common spinners is also great; Phantump is the spinblocker noted to defeat Drilbur and Tentacool, while managing to hold down staryu as well, recovering damage from an ice beam with Horn Leech.


SET NAME
########
name: Rain On Your Parade Sweeper
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Rock Blast
move 3: X-Scissor / Knock Off
move 4: Aqua Jet / Brick Break / Double Edge
ability: Swift Swim
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 236 Attack / 36 Defense / 236 Speed
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance is to bring Anorith's Attack to crushing levels

Rock Blast is solid stab + sash n sub breaker

X-Scissor is Stab and great for hitting neutrally and grass types that might try to stop your rainy day.

Knock off is pretty utility but also sorta strong. X-scissor is usually better though.

Brick break is for rocks and steel, special mention to Pawniard who think they can outspeed and ko with iron head.

Aqua Jet is priority that gets pseudo stab in rain, which is great since Anorith finally gets priority. And its not quick attack.

Double Edge is strongest neutral move Anorith has, great for fighting types.

Set Details
========

Eviolite lets Anorith take hits and avoid being OHKO'd. Berry Juice is berry juice, it can save the shrimp and bring it up to full hp if it's not ohko'd. But Eviolite is definitely better cuz it can be OHKO'd by powerful neutral stabs. Life Orb would wear the bug down too quickly since it's minimum HP is 21 but maybe it could work, not sure. Note, Anorith is actually quite capable of continuing its sweep when rain ends, with a solid 18 or 17 speed backing it up. However, there are quite a few threats that exist which can ruin it's day.

Usage Tips
========

This here's a sweeper. If you can, swords dance in rain, and then begin mowing down the competition like no tomorrow. In rain, the only things faster than Anorith with neutral nature are... Buizel and Poliwag. And +2 Yanma. Carvanha can try to hit +2, but if it's lacking aqua jet Anorith can x-scissor it to death even unboosted. The amazing amount of speed and power it can carry in the rain is insane, can't even lie. Most things just... die. It's great unless you miss with rock blast. It doesn't necessarily need rain, but rain keeps it hitting first and hard without having to take many hits beforehand.

Team Options
========

Since Anorith loves it some rain, it needs quite a bit of support. Eject Button Rain Dance Riolu gives it lots of rain to abuse. Bulky water types such as Mantyke and Chinchou work good too. Since anorith lacks recovery, a bulky wish passer can help it keep going, as well as a healing wish user. Interestingly enough, Anorith actually synergizes well with other swift swim users, since it is not weak to electric or grass, while they in turn resist water and steel. Imperfect synergization though. After rain, it's susceptible to being revenge killed by scarf users; a bulky pokemon to absorb and crush the scarfer is solid, as is some sort of trapping pokemon like Gothorita or Wynaut.


SET NAME
########
name: Shiny Shrimp Sweeper
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Rock Blast / Rock Slide
move 3: X-Scissor
move 4: Double Edge / Brick Break
ability: Battle Armor
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice / Life Orb
evs: 236 Attack / 36 Defense / 236 Speed OR 156 HP / 236 Attack / 36 Defense / 36 Special Defense
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Rock Slide vs Rock Blast is dependant on if you want to do more damage with one attack, or risk doing little or more with multiple hits. Unfortunately it doesn't get stone edge.

X-Scissor is stab, every sweeper needs to make use of both and usually devastates what is weak to it.

Double Edge is power and great neutral coverage, brick break is used in combination with rock, as rock/fighting has excellent coverage together. Brick break also hits steels that would otherwise wall this set.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is the best one for a sweeper, with max speed and max+ attack. After a rock polish, this speedy shrimp can only be caught by priority before it hits. It's decently powerful at 20 attack, able to put mons that rely on berry juice into the dirt. Eviolite lets it survive being OHKO'd, usually requiring at least 2hko's from most mons. Berry juice is berry juice and great for a mon without recovery. Life orb is... iffy. Very much so, I'm not sure if there's any KO's it's missing if it uses it. With the second EV Spread, Anorith is much, much bulkier, and can hit 28 speed after a rock polish boost. Also I was getting really sick of using the same EV spread so I checked what was the max bulk it could go to survive more hits, and it takes hits much, much better with the second spread, while RP helps it outspeed 18 Speed scarfers even without any speed evs. Bonus, it doesn't sacrifice it's attack that much.

Usage Tips
========

Get Anorith in safely, you'll only get one shot to rampage. After a rock polish, anorith hits 34 speed and is uncatchable by literally every scarfed pokemon in the LC metagame. Unless they use priority, yes. Anorith is thankfully neutral to mach punch and vacuum wave; and resists fake out and quick attack. Since priority still does put a dent in our shrimp, RP Anorith is a late game sweeper, and very difficult to stop.

Team Options
========

Bulky teammates who resist Anorith's weaknesses, while spreading status and hazards, are this anorith's best friends. Teshiido Ferroseed comes to mind, as it resists all of Anorith's weaknesses, can lay stealth rocks, and has thunder wave to annoy most of the competition. Spritzee can support it quite well as well, with wish and aromatherapy healing off any damage and status it may obtain if it takes any. Bulky water types, in particular Jellicent, can often switch in and punish mons that try to priority kill the shrimp, as it is immune to all priority, and only weak to sucker punch. Prankster users can mess up RockPolish Anorith as well; a good status absorber or cleric is vital.

SET NAME
########
name: Scarf Shrimp
move 1: Rock Blast / Rock Slide
move 2: X-Scissor
move 3: Knock Off / Double Edge
move 4: Brick Break / Aqua Jet
ability: Battle Armor / Swift Swim
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 236 Attack / 36 Defense / 236 Speed
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Rock Blast / Rock Slide is a dance we've done already.

Same with X-Scissor.

Knock Off is super effective against ghost types and bronzor, removes items. Double Edge is pure power although it carries recoil damage. Also cannot hit ghosts at all, nor steel or rock.

Brick Break is great for steel / rock types, aqua jet is priority to finish off something at really low health that might try to be cute and use priority to inflict a bit more damage before it goes down.

Set Details
========

EVs are the best for Anorith. It doesn't need Jolly because it outspeeds the unboosted metagame with ease with a scarf. Only scarfed 18s, 19s, and 20s outspeed, while it speed ties with other scarfed 17s. Which is unfortunate, but Anorith's killing power is just too good to pass up; a solid 20 can make most mons dead if he outspeeds. And you don't match scarfers vs scarfers typically. If you feel Anorith is too slow, jolly can still do the job most of the time.

Usage Tips
========

A solid revenge killer, with 18 speed and 19 attack Anorith hits a very, very comfortable area for a revenge killer. This set cannot boost, but finally has the coverage it wants. Dark/Fighting/Rock is just peaches coverage wise except for Croagunk, and x-scissor is great for a stab move from a bug type.

Team Options
========

Since this bug can't boost itself, something mixed to get past things that wall it might be great. Croagunk comes to mind, as does Houndour, Magby, and Elekid. It's also quite appreciative of a baton pass boost, perhaps from Gligar or Mienfoo or Torchic.

Other Options
########

A purely defensive set could be done, maximizing Anorith's HP and defensive stats, but without recovery at all, anorith can be worn down easily. It also doesn't take advantage of anorith's glorious attack and speed, unfortunately. Anorith's movepool is also quite limited; it doesn't even get earthquake, which Dwebble does, and only has dig, which should almost never be used. Life Orb is very niche; if you are desperate for KOs it can be used, but often cuts into Anorith's precious HP. Choice band is also an option; since it doesn't take recoil damage as life orb does, it can bring more immediate power. Anorith does not have much priority to abuse with such a set barring aqua jet, which may not be powerful enough even after a choice band boost. Aerial ace is anorith's only option to hit fighting types super effectively, but most will survive it, even after a swords dance boost. So it's not a very good option, except on the scarf set, but even then double edge does similar damage. Another niche option is cross poison to hit fairies super effectively, but it's very weak, and with no stab, limited effectiveness, it should very rarely be considered.

Specially, it is not very powerful but it does carry Earth Power, which could surprise some pokemon ( such as croagunk ) and give it edgequake coverage. Sort of. However, this will require investing into Special Attack, while taking away from either it's speed and probably defenses, so it is unadvisable.


Checks & Counters
########

Oh this is easy: bulky fighting types, especially pure ones. Machop and Timburr take pittance from it's stabs, resist knock off, can shrug off brick breaks and aqua jets, and have powerful stab moves to squash the shrimp. Machop also has bullet punch.

Meditite can threaten Anorith as well; all sets except the bulky rock polish set have a chance to be ko'd by Fake Out + Bullet Punch, but if they do not use that, they have a chance to be killed by a powerful neutral x-scissor, especially since Adamant Anorith outspeeds Jolly Meditite by 1 point.

Croagunk should be noted as, the number one anorith stopper. In rain, Croagunk resists X-Scissor, Rock Blast, immune to aqua jet, resists knock off and brick break; the only way to even hit it neutrally is double edge, and it even heals in the rain. Or Dig if you are really, really desperate to hit it. In the meanwhile, Croagunk carries the dreaded bullet punch, sucker punch, drain punch, and vacuum wave. But Croagunk counters everything.

Aqua Jet users also trouble Anorith, the most powerful ones being Carvanha and Tirtouga. If neither have aqua jet though, they can be killed (tirtouga less easily but after a shell smash Anorith outspeeds in the rain).

Defensive gligar sets can tank rock blasts, resist x-scissor, have roost to recover, and can put a large dent or even ko anorith with earthquake or acrobatics, as well as defog it's hazards away.

Prankster users can mess with Anorith pretty well; Riolu is noted in particular for being a fighting type, can protect against rock blast, and then use Copycat to prankster rock blast right back at Anorith. Murkrow and Purrloin, while unable to come in safely, can parafusion / paraswagger anorith and defeat it that way.

Anorith is susceptible to all hazards, and lacks recovery. It's especially weak to stealth rock; keeping this on the field limits it's switch in opportunities when scarfed, and can ruin it's focus sash.
