[SHORT DESC]
Lowers target's HP to the user's HP.

[LONG DESC]
<p>If the target has more HP than the user, then it does damage equal to target's HP - user's HP, effectively reducing the target's HP to the user's HP. If the target has less HP than the user, nothing happens. It is not affected by resistances, but it does not hit Ghosts.</p>
