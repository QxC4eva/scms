- Croagunk's unique typing and ability allows it to counter and check a myriad of threats, including Water-types, Normal-types, Fairy-types, Steel-types, Dark-types and Rock-types.

Moves
========

- Croagunk can use the four listed attacks to allow it to check a wide variety of Pokemon
- Drain Punch gives it semi-recovery and allows it to beat Rock-, Ice- and Normal-types with ease.
- Sludge Bomb is its most powerful move, hitting Fairy-types super-effectively, making it a good Spritzee switch-in.
- Vacuum Wave is really useful for faster Pokemon such as Carvanha, Bunnelby, and Pawniard and its also useful for picking off faster weakened threats.
- Knock Off is one of the best moves in the game, and allows it to pose a threat to many of its switch-ins.

Set Details
========

- Eviolite gives you extra bulk and works well with its recovery from Drain Punch
- EVs are distributed between the defenses and the attacks, though it has to sacrifice its speed unfortunately.
- Dry Skin allows you to completely wall Tirtouga and Carvanha, as well as making it a good switch-in to Chinchou and Staryu.


Usage Tips
========

- Croagunk should be switching in on the things that it walls and doing what it needs to do, but shouldn't be expected to be a huge threat to opposing teams, apart from using Knock Off in the early game.
- It's mostly used as a glue Pokemon to stop Pokemon such as Tirtouga from walking all over your team.

Team Options
========

- As it's often used as a glue Pokemon, Croagunk generally offers more to the team than the team can offer to it.
- It does, however, need good switch-ins to Psychic-, Fire-, Ground-, and Flying-type moves from the likes of Meditite, Larvesta, Drilbur, Murkrow and Fletchling.
- Rock- and Steel-types make great partners as they resist Flying-type moves. Tirtouga also likes Croagunk's Knock Off support.
- Rock- and Water-types can take on the Fire-types that Croagunk hates.
- Slowpoke can handle Meditite and most Ground and Fire-types, making it a good partner.
- Other Fighting-types such as Meditite appreciate Croagunk's ability to Knock Off Fighting-type switch-ins as well as being a good switch-in to Fairy-types.

Other Options
########

- Bulk Up and Nasty Plot are both fantastic boosting moves that Croagunk can use. The Bulk Up set can utilise Drain Punch, Gunk Shot and Sucker Punch, whilst the Nasty Plot can utilise Sludge Bomb, Shadow Ball and Vacuum Wave.
- Fake out is an option, but it is quite weak, and most of the time Croagunk has more important moves to use.
- Rock Slide can hit incoming Flying- and Fire-types, particularly Larvesta.
- Earthquake can also hit Fire-types and is more useful for Ponyta than Rock Slide is.
- Ice Punch hits Flying- and Ground-types super-effectively, who often switch in to Croagunk.

Checks & Counters
########

**Psychic-types**: Psychic-types, such as Meditite or Slowpoke, make great counters to Croagunk, hitting it with their 4x super-effective STAB.

**Ground-types**: Hippopotas and Drilbur can easily switch in and immediately threaten Croagunk. Diglett struggles to switch in, but can easily trap and KO Croagunk.

**Flying-types**:Murkrow and Fletchling can outspeed and beat Croagunk with their STAB. Vullaby, Mantyke and Archen also make excellent switch-ins.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types resist Croagunk's STAB attacks and can usually threaten it with a burn.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types hit Croagunk hard due to Dry Skin. Larvesta and Ponyta threaten with a burn, and the former resists Fighting-types moves.
