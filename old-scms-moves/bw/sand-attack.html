[SHORT DESC]
Lowers target's accuracy by 1 stage.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's accuracy by one stage. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The effect of Sand-Attack is not particularly useful in most competitive matches because reducing the foe's accuracy is not a reliable strategy, as the opponent can simply switch out to negate the effect. The majority of players would prefer to incapacitate a foe completely (inducing sleep, for example) or simply use a set-up move.</p>
