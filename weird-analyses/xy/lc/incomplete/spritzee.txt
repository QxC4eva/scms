Cleric
########
name: Cleric
move 1: Aromatherapy
move 2: Wish
move 3: Protect
move 4: Moonblast
ability: Aroma Veil
item: Eviolite
evs: 212 HP / 196 Def / 12 SpA / 76 SpD / 12 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

    Spritzee's access to Wish and Aromatherapy allow it to support its team admirably by restoring the HP of other teammates and also by curing them of debilitating status.
    Protect allows Spritzee to heal from its own wish and can also be used to scout choice users.
    Moonblast is a reliable STAB attack that has fairly solid coverage and hits the Fighting-types that Spritzee can switch in on super effectively.


Set Details
========

    Spritzee's combination of bulk and typing allow it to check many dangerous threats in Little Cup such as Meditite, Carvanha, Scraggy, and Mienfoo.
    Using an Eviolite maximizes Spritzee's defenses, and allows to reliably check the aforementioned threats.

    The EV spread listed and a Bold nature maximizes Spritzee's physical defense while also maximizing HP for the biggest wish possible. 76 Special Defense EVs are used to increase Spritzee's special defense one point, and the rest are put into Speed and Special Attack to increase them by one point each.

Usage Tips
========

    Spritzee is able to check most Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types throughout the match and should use free turns by healing itself with Wish or curing its teammates of status with Aromatherapy.
    By using Wish on a free turn, Spritzee can either heal itself by using Protect or switch to teammate that has a better matchup to whatever threat comes in on Spritzee. However, it is best to only use Protect when necessary, as overusing it can give a free turn for the opponent to set up.
    Additionally, although Spritzee resists Knock Off, it is important to keep Spritzee away from users of the move, such as Pawniard, as without its Eviolite it becomes more difficult for Spritzee to check various threats.


Team Options
========

    Munchlax, especially berry juice variants, is an excellent teammate for Spritzee, as Munchlax can sponge most special Steel- and Poison-type attacks while Spritzee can cover Munchlax's fighting weakness very well. Munchlax also appreciates Aromatherapy support, as burn and poison greatly hinder its walling potential.
    Ferroseed makes a great partner, as it can easily switch in on both of Spritzee's weaknesses and set up hazards while Spritzee can handle the Fighting-types that trouble Ferroseed. However, this core will struggle with Fire-types.
    Although Spritzee is not weak to stealth rock, it is affected by all entry hazards, making Tentacool and Drilbur good partners as they can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Tentacool resists both of Spritzee's weaknesses, while Drilbur can threaten the Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types that resist Moonblast with Earthquake.
    Spritzee walls and removes Fighting-types, so teammates that struggle with Fighting-types can capitalize on this such as Pawniard and Scraggy. Pawniard can easily switch in on most Steel- and Poison- types, while Scraggy can remove Steel-types with its Fighting STAB.


Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Wish
move 3: Protect / Aromatherapy
move 4: Moonblast / Draining Kiss
ability: Aroma Veil
item: Eviolite
evs: 212 HP / 196 Def / 12 SpA / 76 SpD / 12 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

    Spritzee can also take a more offensive route thanks to its access to Calm Mind. With Wish and its fantastic bulk, Spritzee can easily boost multiple times and then sweep when it has acquired enough boosts.
    Although relatively weak, Draining Kiss has a fantastic 75 percent recovery ratio, and it is the best option if Protect is not selected.
    Moonblast can also be used, as it allows Spritzee to hit hard without relying on multiple boosts, and is better used if Aromatherapy is dropped in favor for Protect.
    Aromatherapy can be used so Toxic does not end Spritzee's sweep prematurely, but Protect can also be used to guarantee wish recovery.


Set Details
========

    This set abuses Spritzee's good defensive and offensive typing alongside Calm Mind to slowly boost and break down the opponent's team.
    A physically defensive EV spread and a Bold nature is used because it makes Spritzee a very good tank after a Calm Mind that is very hard to OHKO without a STAB super effective move.
    The choice between Aromatherapy and Protect is mainly personal preference, Aromatherapy can cure Spritzee of Toxic poison and burn, but Spritzee will miss the guaranteed recovery provided by Protect. To remedy this, Draining Kiss is used as it lessens the need for immediate Wish recovery.
    Aroma Veil is an amazing ability for this kind of set, as it allows Spritzee to set up without fear of Taunt or Encore, which would otherwise give this set trouble.


Usage Tips
========

    This Spritzee should only attempt to set up once Poison- and Steel-types are eliminated, as many of them can overpower Spritzee with their STAB attacks.
    Spritzee can still come in to check Fighting-types early game, but its damage output with Draining Kiss can be disappointing at times. If you want maximum early game utility, Moonblast would prove to be a better choice as it relies less on set up.
    If you are using Aromatherapy over Protect, it is beneficial to use Wish constantly in tandem with Calm Mind to get as many boosts as possible.
    If selecting Protect, be sure to eliminate any potential status users, especially those with Toxic, Sleep Powder, and Spore.


Team Options
========

    This Spritzee is a standalone sweeper that plays fairly independently, but appreciates the removal of Poison- and Steel-types that Spritzee cannot break through.
    Again, Drilbur and other Ground-types are excellent partners, as they can switch in to most Posion- and Steel-types and remove them with STAB Earthquake.
    If not using Aromatherapy, another cleric such as Chinchou can be a good teammate, as it has a quadruple resistance to Steel and has Electric STAB to beat Tentacool and Skrelp, two threats that give this set trouble.
    Pawniard and Spritzee complement each other well, as Spritzee resists Fighting and Pawniard can defeat Poison- and Steel-types due to its typing. It can also provide Knock Off support so Spritzee can break through threats easier.
    Diglett can trap and kill most Poison- and Steel-types, such as Grimer, Croagunk, Magnemite, and Tentacool.


Other Options

    Coverage in Energy Ball, Flash Cannon, Psychic, and Thunderbolt which can hit specific threats but Spritzee generally has no room for them and all out offense is a mediocre option as Spritzee is very slow even with maximum speed investment.
    Hidden Power Fighting and Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Pawniard and Magnemite, popular switch-ins to Spritzee. However, Spritzee has difficulty finding room for them and a neutral Moonblast hits harder than a super effective Hidden Power.
    Trick Room is notable because Spritzee resists dark type moves, unlike other users of the move.
    Disable, however Spirtzee's immunity is too uncommon to take advantage of this
    Dual Screens, Reflect is an option on the Calm Mind set
    Rest + Sleep Talk can replace Wish and Aromatherapy on the Calm Mind set
    Specially Defensive is viable as well




Checks & Counters

    Steel-types: Magnemite, Ferroseed, Pawniard, Bronzor, most of them have status or super effective STAB. Pawniard can get a potential Defiant boost from Moonblast.
    Poison-types: Gastly, Foongus, Tentacool, Skrelp can tank hits from Spritzee well, Gastly has access to Trick
    Physical Fire-types work best to counter Spritzee, such as Larvesta and Ponyta as Flare Blitz will eventually wear down Spritzee. Special Fire-types such as Houndour will have more difficulty breaking through the Calm Mind set. Vulpix can use Roar to phaze Spritzee and takes little damage from Spritzee's boosted attacks.
    Clear Smog completely counters Calm Mind; Koffing, Shellos, Foongus are notable users of Clear Smog
    Toxic if lacking Aromatherapy
    Knock Off is annoying, Pawniard especially due to having super effective Iron Head
    Trick / Switcheroo with choice items, Misdreavus and Gastly are common Trick users
