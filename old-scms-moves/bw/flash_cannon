<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Powerful, accurate, and reliable, Flash Cannon is the only special Steel-type move that most Pokemon have access to. That being said, Steel is a subpar attacking type, and should only be used as a coverage move on Steel-types. Even then Flash Cannon is an extremely rare sight, with Magnezone and Magneton being possibly the most common users of the move. Usually though these Pokemon prefer to use the slot for a move with wider coverage or for a utility move such as Volt Switch.</p>
