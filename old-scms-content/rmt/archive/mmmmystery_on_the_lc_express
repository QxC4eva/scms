<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Ever since I first played LC in the HGSS era, LC has been one of my favorite tiers. I have switched back and forth between it and Ubers, OU, DW, and whatever other tier happens to be the flavor of the month for me. I like Little Cup a lot more this gen now that Eviolite has given some breadth to the tier, and now that the metagame has sort of settled down a bit, I'm hooked. For my new team, I wanted to use a core I have been seeing used very successfully recently, which is that of Mienfoo, Murkrow, and Misdreavus. I built the team originally around CB Mienfoo, since slapping a Choice item on an already powerful Pokemon is usually how I begin any team, and while it did have some success, Ghost-types and Water-types were running through me. After changing Mienfoo's set to that which is here, and adding Chinchou and Deerling over Croagunk and Slowpoke, this team was born:</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/649.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Mienfoo</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 238 Atk / 238 Spe<br />
IVs: 0 HP<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Hi Jump Kick<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Fake Out</p>

<p>Mienfoo is the first part of my offensive core, and provides priority and ridiculous power. This is my favorite Mienfoo set, and while the Eviolite Knock Off set is nice too, the pure power this set offers is the reason why I went with it. Fake Out breaks Sturdy, Sashes, and offers good damage overall. It also allows me to completely prevent Dwebble from setting up hazards if Stone Edge hits. Hi Jump Kick wields such awesome power, being able to OHKO and 2HKO a large portion of the metagame. Stone Edge provides the best coverage I can get, hitting Flying- and Bug-types super effectively, such as the aforementioned Dwebble. It is also my strongest move against Ghost-types, which can be useful if I successfully predict a switch-in, though I'm more likely to U-turn out to Murkrow. U-turn deals damage and activates Regenerator, healing all the Life Orb recoil damage I just took as well as any weather damage. Mienfoo makes an excellent offensive pivot, and I have yet to make a successful LC team without it.</p>

<p><strong>Murkrow</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Prankster<br />
EVs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 20 Def / 20 SpD / 188 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Roost<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Brave Bird</p>

<p>Originally a SubCM set, I switched to this set when I realized how hard it is to successfully pull off a sweep with mono-Dark coverage. It still provides the Substitute user I wanted, while offering a second priority move to complement Mienfoo. The SubRoost combination becomes 10x more effective with Prankster, making sure that nothing can status me before I throw up a Sub. It also begins a deadly guessing game in tandem with Sucker Punch. Sucker Punch can threaten pretty much every set-up sweeper in the metagame that isn't Scraggy, allowing me to possibly stop a sweeper that got out of hand. Brave Bird hits all the Fighting-types that resist Sucker Punch super effectively, and since Murkrow outspeeds all of them, there is little risk in trying to wipe them out with Brave Bird.</p>

<p><strong>Misdreavus</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 240 SpA / 240 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Trick<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting</p>

<p>Scarf Misdreavus wraps up my offensive core by providing a Fighting- and Ground-type immunity, access to Trick, and high power. Shadow Ball is an obvious STAB move, dealing a large amount of damage to enemy Misdreavus, Abra, and Slowpoke, all big threats to my team. Thunderbolt dispatches Murkrow and deals more damage to Staryu than Shadow Ball does, but Chinchou makes using this move risky if it is present. HP Fighting gives me perfect coverage and a way to hit Ferroseed and Munchlax, if only for a decent amount of damage. Trick messes up walls and sticks Pokemon like Ferroseed, Croagunk, and Bronzor with a highly unwanted Choice item. Misdreavus glues the team together in a way, and if I am unsure about what Pokemon to send in next, it will usually be Misdreavus.</p>

<p><strong>Chinchou</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Volt Absorb<br />
EVs: 52 Def / 232 SpA / 224 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Agility<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Hidden Power Grass</p>

<p>Chinchou I added because I was still feeling very Staryu weak. It can KO Mienfoo all the time and Murkrow if it loses the Speed tie, and with support from Chinchou or another Electric-type resist, Misdeavus becomes a shaky check. I went with a bulky Agility set, because it actually doesn't miss the power Life Orb gives too much. Hydro Pump, in my opinion, is one of the best moves in LC because of the sheer power it provides, along with the Water-types excellent coverage. STAB Thunderbolt complements it wonderfully by roasting other Water-types not named Chinchou. Hidden Power Grass I have been running solely for opposing Chinchou, but I am giving serious thought to changing it to HP Fire. I have experienced a ton of missed set-up opportunities just because the opponent had a Snover or Ferroseed in the wings, ready to sop up any attack I could possibly throw at them.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/81.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Magnemite</strong> @ Occa Berry<br />
Ability: Magnet Pull<br />
EVs: 236 HP / 240 SpA<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Volt Switch<br />
- Flash Cannon</p>

<p>This set was designed to be the best Murkrow counter and lure possible (the fact that its name starts with M as well is a bonus!) Packing a 4x resistance to Brave Bird, a resistance to Sucker Punch and HP Grass, and a surprise Occa Berry to tank Heat Wave and retaliate with Thunderbolt for an OHKO. It also functions excellently as a way to remove enemy Magnemite and Snover, as I take 50% from their HP Fire and OHKO both back with mine. HP Fire can also trap Ferroseed too, but unfortunately Eviolite Bronzor escapes with a 3HKO and carries Earthquake to destroy Magnemite. Flash cannon provides a secondary STAB move that can hit Ground-types, as well as OHKO Snover if HP Fire is a risky option. Volt Switch is a filler move since Magnemite can't waste any HP on Substitutes without dying way too easily. Since Magnemite is so slow, it almost guarantees a free switch plus a large chunk of damage. It can also help me feign a Choice scarf in a pinch.</p>

<p><strong>Deerling</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Sap Sipper<br />
EVs: 196 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 236 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Seed Bomb<br />
- Jump Kick<br />
- Return<br />
- Nature Power</p>

<p>While it is a strange set, Scarf Deerling is actually a lot better than I had imagined. Even with Chinchou, Water-types were still giving me problems, and so I sought out a Grass-type to fit my team. Deerling is the only Grass-type in LC with what I thought were good Choice item user stats, a high Speed that can outpace Mienfoo without the Scarf (if I were running Jolly, as it is now I only Speed tie without the scarf), and a good attack stat. Seed Bomb makes this kind of set viable and is a great gift to Deerling from B2W2, giving it a reliable Grass STAB to KO weakened Water-types with. Return 2HKOes Dragon Dance Axew, Eviolite Mienfoo, and other stuff I can't name off the top of my head. Jump Kick murders Snover and gives me a move to hit Ferroseed. Nature Power hits Fire-types and Magnemite, as well as being sort of filler-y since Deerling doesn't really get much. While it isn't a murder machine, Deerling can clean up late-game very efficiently, especially with the surprise factor a scarf set carries.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I haven't hit #1 on any ladder for a very long time, so I'm excited to finally claim the spot for myself again. While I'm still not satisfied with how weak I can be to some common pairs, including the vast majority of what user raseri brings to the battle, I'm still very pleased with this team overall.</p>
