<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack by two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Swords Dance is one of the best stat-boosting moves in the game. Any physical attacker will enjoy the +2 Attack boost Swords Dance has to offer. Terrakion, in particular, has not only Swords Dance to boost his massive Attack stat but also an excellent dual STAB combination, giving him the potential to become a deadly sweeper. Other users include, but are not limited to, Infernape, Lucario, and Haxorus. Swords Dance is a great move for physical sweepers and should always be considered.</p>
