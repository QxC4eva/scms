<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello again! In the last issue we had a look at the GSC and ADV Pokemon that, while not standing out in the generations they exist, have the  right tools to be top-tier Pokemon in RBY had they existed then. As promised in last issue's article, this time we are going to look at DPP  and BW Pokemon that meet the same requirements. This article is the second part, so if you haven't already, I strongly encourage you to give  the <a href="/smog/issue26/underdogs">first part</a> a read. By doing so, not only will you be able to read about older  generation Pokemon, but also about the rules and guidelines that have  been followed to determine which Pokemon meet the requirements to make  an appearance in this article. Without further ado, these are the most  remarkable Pokemon:</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>When making the speculations for each Pokemon, the metagame considered is the real RBY metagame we are all used to with only the current Pokemon on it, and not a metagame where every featured Pokemon is allowed. However, references to other featured or new generation Pokemon may be done in order to help come up with a more accurate and reasonable Special stat or stat spread. This was applied to the first part of the article as well.</li>
<li>Stats will be ordered the following way: HP / Attack / Defense / Speed / Special.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DPP Pokemon</h2>

<h3>Torterra</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/392.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>95 / 109 / 105 / 56 / 75</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>UU / NU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>bottom-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Earthquake / Razor Leaf / Hyper Beam / Swords Dance</dd>
</dl>

<p>One could bury Torterra due to its quadruple weakness to the very common Ice-type moves, but Torterra does have some things going for it. First, its Grass / Ground typing doesn't add any other common weaknesses and provides a useful immunity to Thunder Wave, as well as resistances to  both STABs from Golem and Rhydon. Torterra would thus be the perfect  check to the Ground-types thanks to its high physical bulk and ability to OHKO them with STAB Razor Leaf, though it should be noted that Rhydon  could always run Blizzard, as its fourth move is almost never used.  Speaking of Razor Leaf, despite coming from an average base 75 Special,  it has the potential to hit Water-types extremely hard. STAB Earthquake, meanwhile, will severely hurt anything that doesn't resist it,  especially frail Pokemon such as Alakazam and Chansey&mdash;for  reference, Torterra's Earthquake is about as strong as Golem's. Moreover, Torterra can boost its attack with Swords Dance and back up  Earthquake with Hyper Beam or the weaker but safer Body Slam. Unfortunately, Torterra is slow, so its quadruple weakness to Ice-type  attacks is further accentuated. Starmie, Tauros, and Chansey will OHKO or almost OHKO it while Lapras and Cloyster will always take Torterra out in one hit. Moreover, as a Ground-type, Torterra is incapable of countering Zapdos due to its weakness to Drill Peck. It doesn't learn  status moves like most other Grass-types either. All in all, Torterra would need to watch out for Ice-type moves and would require some key  paralysis support to work effectively, but would nonetheless be a Pokemon to watch out for in RBY.</p>

<h3>Purugly</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/437.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>71 / 82 / 64 / 112 / 59</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>NU / NU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>mid-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Slash / Hypnosis / BubbleBeam / Hyper Beam</dd>
</dl>

<p>Take Persian. Give it 12 more base Attack and, most importantly, Hypnosis, and it essentially turns into Purugly. Being slower than  Starmie is the only drawback when you compare it to Persian, although on the other hand, Purugly has a small chance to 2HKO it with Slash.  Moreover, the higher base Attack stat gives Purugly a guaranteed 2HKO on Chansey with Slash and comes in handy against bulkier foes such as  Snorlax and Slowbro, increasing the chance of 3HKOing them with the possible help of Hyper Beam. Needless to say, Purugly shares the same  Gengar problem with Persian; however, with the addition of Hypnosis, Purugly at least has a back-up plan against it. In addition, Purugly  breaks the general trend that in RBY, sleep comes from not-very-threatening specially-oriented Pokemon that can generally be handled by special walls. Purugly can actually abuse the free turn it  gets from putting something to sleep to fire away a powerful critical  hit Slash that will hit the incoming Pokemon extremely hard unless it  resists the move. And that's where BubbleBeam comes in&mdash;the equivalent RBY TM to DPP Water Pulse; like on Persian, it will 2HKO  Golem and Rhydon despite the slight drop in the Special stat. Don't be fooled by its look; Purugly would have been a pretty threatening Pokemon  in RBY.</p>

<h3>Lickilicky</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/468.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>110 / 85 / 95 / 50 / 80</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>NU / NU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>top-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Body Slam / Earthquake / Explosion / Wrap</dd>
</dl>

<p>Being a Normal-type Pokemon with well-rounded stats is always a good  starting point in RBY. Inevitably, Lickilicky has to be compared with  Snorlax. The latter boasts slightly higher special bulk and a  significantly higher base Attack stat, as well as access to Amnesia.  Don't discard Lickilicky so quickly however, as it also has its own perks, namely access to Swords Dance, STAB Wrap, and 20 higher base  Speed that lets it outspeed Golem and Rhydon. Moreover, Lickilicky's STAB Explosion is stronger than Snorlax's Selfdestruct, and thus the  strongest move in the whole metagame&mdash;it will OHKO Tauros almost every time. Unfortunately, Lickilicky doesn't have room to pack  all its good moves in the same moveset&mdash;the player would have  to choose between Wrap, Swords Dance, and Hyper Beam for the last  slot&mdash; but the fact that its movepool contains them makes  Lickilicky a pretty dangerous and unpredictable Pokemon. Both Wrap and  Swords Dance will require help from teammates in the form of spreading  paralysis to work at their best, although Lickilicky's above average  bulk helps making the low Speed stat less of an issue. In addition,  Lickilicky can learn special coverage moves such as Blizzard,  Thunderbolt, and Surf that come from a respectable base 80 Special stat;  they'll rarely be worth consuming a moveslot but make Lickilicky even  more unpredictable. While Lickilicky would face competition from the  overly-used Tauros and Snorlax as a Normal-type attacker, Lickilicky's  unique tools and well-rounded stats grant that it would be one of the  most dangerous Pokemon in the overused metagame.</p> 

<h3>Rhyperior</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/469.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>115 / 140 / 130 / 40 / 55</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>UU / UU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>top-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Earthquake / Rock Slide / Body Slam / Substitute</dd>
</dl>

<p>Rhyperior is one of the three evolved forms of RBY Pokemon featured in  this article, but unlike the other two, Rhyperior evolves from a Pokemon  that is already OU in RBY on its own right. Upon evolution, Rhyperior  gains slight boosts to every stat except Speed. These boosts are  especially notable on the defensive side; for instance, Rhyperior can  survive one Blizzard from Lapras and Jynx, is not 2HKOed by Alakazam's  or Exeggutor's Psychic outside of a critical hit or a Special fall, and  will often avoid a 2HKO from Golem's Earthquake. The Attack boost  provides Rhyperior with an almost guaranteed 2HKO on Starmie and  contributes to outpowering Snorlax in a battle of Earthquakes. It's no  secret that Rhyperior would be an extremely scary threat in the RBY  metagame considering how dangerous Rhydon already is; it would be the  holder of the highest Attack stat in RBY. If you are looking for someone  who can finally put an end to the never-ending "who is the better  Ground / Rock-type in RBY" discussion, then Rhyperior is your man!</p>

<h3>Tangrowth</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/470.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt> 
<dd>85 / 75 / 125 / 50 / 110</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>UU / RU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>bottom-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Sleep Powder / Mega Drain / Body Slam / Swords Dance</dd>
</dl>

<div class="float-right"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue27/underdogs_tangrowth.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Tangrowth is certainly a pretty conflictive Pokemon when you attempt to  move it back to RBY. At first glance, the logical spread would contain a  Special stat of 110 to be consistent with Tangela, as it wouldn't make  much sense to make Tangrowth have base 50 less Special than its previous  evolution. On the other hand, while in DPP and BW Tangrowth has  balanced stats by virtue of an awful Special Defense stat, the more  natural spread would mean that Tangrowth would be on-par with the  legendary birds in terms of BST, which is certainly an overkill. One  would expect that Nintendo wouldn't have gone too far boosting its HP  and Attack stats if they had created Tangrowth in RBY. Thus, I have  tried to come up with a reasonable spread myself, but consider it a mere  approximation. Having said that, even with the HP and Attack drops,  Tangrowth would still be a decent Pokemon in RBY, thanks to an  outstanding physical bulk that makes it the perfect Ground-type check  and a versatile support movepool that includes Sleep Powder, Stun Spore,  Swords Dance, Growth, and Wrap. What Tangrowth lacks, however, is  instant power. Slow and with its best STAB move being Mega Drain and its  only secondary options being unSTABed Normal-type attacks, Tangrowth  needs to set up before being able to do relevant damage. As a Swords  Dancer, Tangrowth is a lot bulkier than the other Grass-type Swords  Dancers, isn't weak to Psychic, and resists Earthquake, while being  slower and losing the very useful Razor Leaf. A Growth set can be  extremely annoying and difficult to take down, but unfortunately, the  setup is slow, and even at 999 Special, Chansey is only 5HKOed by Mega  Drain while even Alakazam avoids a 2HKO. Gengar, Zapdos, and Exeggutor  will also give Tangrowth a very hard time no matter the set, although  Tangrowth could always put one of its checks to sleep or paralyze them  with Stun Spore. All in all, Tangrowth would be an interesting Pokemon  in RBY with enormous bulk and a variety of support moves, but a lack of  good attacking moves would hinder it.</p>

<h3>Gallade</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/480.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>68 / 125 / 65 / 80 / 65</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>BL / RU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>bottom-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Slash / Earthquake / Hypnosis / Thunder Wave</dd>
</dl>

<p>Gallade is an interesting Pokemon that boasts a very high Attack stat  and versatile movepool. Its typing would've been totally awesome if  Gallade could at least learn a good Fighting-type move, but as it  stands, its secondary Fighting typing is mostly a negative addition due  to making Gallade neutral to Psychic. Thus, Gallade can't abuse its  excellent Attack stat with a STAB move, and, furthermore, it has  paper-thin defenses and isn't exactly fast either. Not everything is bad  news for Gallade, however. It has access to Slash, which will always  score a critical hit and is about as powerful as Persian's despite not  getting STAB on it. Earthquake or STAB Psychic are useful coverage  options, although Earthquake is preferred due to the low Special stat.  Hypnosis allows Gallade to take the role of a sleep inducer; while  Hypnosis is unreliable due to its user's bad defenses, it's always an  excellent move to have as it makes Gallade more of a threat. Gallade can  also employ a double status role thanks to Thunder Wave, which can  cripple faster Pokemon such as Tauros and gives Gallade a chance to  break Starmie and Chansey with a timely full paralysis. Gallade could  also opt for a Swords Dance set to set up deadly Hyper Beams, but it  would clash with Slash and force Gallade to drop a status move at least.  Lastly, Submission and Thunderbolt are also available options, and one  should not forget that, while unreliable, Submission would still deal  loads of damage to all the Normal-types. As you see, Gallade has a  pretty versatile movepool, but ultimately, weak defenses and lack of an  effective STAB move would make it sit close to the edge between OU and  BL in the first generation.</p> 

<h3>Uxie</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/485.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>75 / 75 / 130 / 95 / 130</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>UU / RU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>Uber</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Amnesia / Psychic / Rest / Thunderbolt</dd>
</dl>

<p>Uxie is another Pokemon with a conflictive Special stat. A base Special  stat of 75 would make Uxie's BST too low compared to any other legendary  Pokemon, while 130 would increase its BST to too high levels for a  Pokemon belonging to a legendary trio. It may not be a big deal though,  since Uxie would be just about 20 points higher than the trio of  legendary birds in RBY. In the end, however, it doesn't really matter  that much whether Uxie would have kept the Special stat of 130 or obtain  something along the likes of 110, since an Amnesia Psychic-type with an  outstanding Defense stat and very good Special is simply too powerful  for OU. Unfortunately, Uxie doesn't get Recover, so in the Ubers  metagame Mewtwo would remain the king. Moreover, Uxie can't learn Ice  Beam to go toe-to-toe with Mewtwo, who can try to freeze Uxie with its  own Ice Beam while being completely safe against it. Needless to say,  being inferior to the single most powerful Pokemon of all time hardly  means much and Uxie would still be present in the vast majority of RBY  Ubers teams. In the fourth slot, Uxie can use Thunderbolt to deal with  Slowbro and Starmie better, Pokemon that most variants of Mewtwo tend to  struggle against. Other options include Reflect to become virtually  unbreakable from the physical side, Thunder Wave, or even Flash to  cheese with Mewtwo, since with Rest, Uxie has the potential to stall out  Recover Mewtwo in the event that a freeze doesn't occur. As if one  Mewtwo wasn't enough!</p>

<h3>Regigigas</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/491.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>110 / 160 / 110 / 100 / 80</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>NU / NU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>Uber</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Body Slam / Earthquake / Hyper Beam / Thunder Wave</dd>
</dl>

<p>Regigigas is a total beast. It may have very well been some sort of  Slaking counterpart in RBY because, as we saw in the first  part of the article, even if Slaking was not created as a legendary  Pokemon, the BST and enormous power of both Slaking and Regigigas scream  legendary in RBY. Not only does Regigigas lose its biggest flaw by  removing Slow Start, but it also gains a lot by the fact that Normal is  an excellent type in RBY. Regigigas is all in all extremely similar to  Slaking, so there isn't much to add; while Regigigas would be banned  from OU, it would be an excellent Pokemon in the Ubers metagame. STAB  physical attacks coming off an Attack stat of 418 will cause a lot of  harm to every Pokemon in the game, including the two Ubers: Mewtwo and  Mew. Regigigas's bulk is also outstanding; like Slaking, Regigigas is  able to survive two Psychics from Mewtwo and has a ~3/4 chance of  surviving a 999 STAB Psychic at full health. Regigigas also gets Thunder  Wave, which would prove useful to cripple and outspeed Mewtwo, for  instance. While Slaking would edge Regigigas due to Slash and slightly  higher bulk, one shouldn't expect any less from Regigigas as far as impact on the metagame is concerned.</p>

<h2>BW Pokemon</h2>

<h3>Gigalith</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/554.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>85 / 135 / 130 / 25 / 60</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>NU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>bottom-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Rock Slide / Earthquake / Explosion / Body Slam</dd>
</dl>

<p>Gigalith is another of the Rock-type Pokemon that aren't part Ground-type featured in the article. Thus, Gigalith would become the  only Rock-type Pokemon in OU without a weakness to Ice-type moves or a  quadruple weakness to Grass- and Water-type moves. When you look at  Gigalith, the first thing that stands out is its base 135 Attack stat,  which means that even without STAB Earthquake, Gigalith has the  potential to hit quite hard. Gigalith enjoys being able to learn an  incredibly strong Explosion that is as powerful as Snorlax's  Selfdestruct. For example, Gigalith's Explosion can OHKO Starmie,  something that Golem's doesn't always accomplish. However, as we saw  with Regirock in the last issue, lack of Ground typing comes with  disadvantages, which are the loss of STAB on Earthquake and the  vulnerability to Thunder Wave as well as Thunderbolt from Zapdos and  Jolteon. Moreover, Gigalith's pathetic Speed stat allows Pokemon as slow  as Snorlax and Slowbro to outspeed it, as well as the two other  Ground-types. Despite these flaws, the aforementioned strong points mean  that Gigalith would be a viable alternative to Golem and Rhydon,  although these two would still remain the most common Rock-types in RBY.</p>

<h3>Cofagrigus</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/593.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>58 / 50 / 145 / 30 / 105</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>UU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>mid-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Night Shade / Rest / Body Slam / Haze</dd>
</dl>

<p>Cofagrigus may be lackluster in movepool and offensive presence, but  that doesn't prevent it from being the physical wall the RBY metagame is  missing. With immunity to Body Slam and Hyper Beam, and neutrality to  Earthquake and every possible coverage special attack, Cofagrigus can  use Rest and survive its two turns against Snorlax and Tauros pretty  comfortably. Standard Snorlax only 5HKOes Cofagrigus at best with  Earthquake or Surf, and while Tauros's Blizzard can 4HKO Cofagrigus with  a critical hit, the fearsome bull will have a very hard time trying to  knock out Cofagrigus. As a Ghost-type, Cofagrigus is the perfect Pokemon  to absorb predicted Explosions, and unlike Gengar, it won't take a  super effective hit if predicted. Unfortunately, that's about the only  things Cofagrigus is good at, but being able to check arguably the two  most dangerous Pokemon in the game effectively makes Cofagrigus useful  enough to become a mid-tier OU Pokemon in RBY. Night Shade is its best  move to deal consistent damage, wearing down Pokemon unable to recover  their health&mdash;it hits Normal-type Pokemon in RBY. Body Slam is  extremely weak, but it is Cofagrigus's best move to inflict paralysis  and actually do something to the three Recover / Softboiled users in  RBY. Considering Psychic would hardly ever outpower Night Shade, Haze  can be used in the last slot despite its flaws should Snorlax surprise  Cofagrigus with an Amnesia set. With limited but invaluable uses,  Cofagrigus is a Pokemon that could alter quite a bit in the RBY  metagame.</p>

<h3>Beheeyem</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/636.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>75 / 75 / 75 / 40 / 125</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>NU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>mid-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Psychic / Recover / Thunder Wave / Thunderbolt</dd>
</dl>

<p>Beheeyem is essentially a bulkier, much slower version of Alakazam that  also happens to learn Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt is a great addition  because thanks to it, Beheeyem isn't forced into a stall war against  Starmie and prevents Slowbro from switching in to set up Amnesias. Its  physical bulk is Starmie-like, and although Beheeyem is still pretty  frail by RBY standards, it can take physical hits much better than  Alakazam and potentially even recover off STAB Body Slams.  Unfortunately, Beheeyem is incredibly slow. Instead of outspeeding the  whole metagame except Jolteon, Beheeyem is slower than even Golem and  Rhydon, outspeeding only Snorlax and Slowbro. You may think this is  still passable since Alakazam is prone to getting paralyzed  anyway&mdash;and the same should be expected about  Beheeyem&mdash;but an awful Speed stat also means an awful critical  hit rate, subsequently lowering its average damage output as well as its  chances of lucking Chansey. Don't be fooled by these negatives though;  Alakazam would kill for higher physical bulk or a coverage special move.  Beheeyem would make a very good alternative to Alakazam and would be  almost as common as it in OU.</p>

<h3>Cryogonal</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/645.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>70 / 50 / 30 / 105 / 135</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>RU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>top-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Ice Beam / Recover / Acid Armor / Blizzard</dd>
</dl>

<p>Continuing with Alakazam analogies, Cryogonal is an Ice-type version of  Alakazam with extremely similar stats, but slower than Tauros and  Starmie with even inferior physical bulk. Yeah, you can laugh at this as  much as you want, but Cryogonal would be a pretty good Pokemon in RBY.  Cryogonal becomes the best Chansey counter in the game; while neither  can get past the other Pokemon via damage, Cryogonal can threaten  Chansey with a freeze from Ice Beam or Blizzard while being immune to  Chansey's freeze itself. Acid Armor suits Cryogonal perfectly, raising  its physical bulk to Exeggutor levels (outside of critical hits) with  only one boost and preventing physical sweepers from capitalizing on it;  one should not forget that STAB Ice-type attacks coming off a Special  stat of 368 hit every physical sweeper extremely hard. Cryogonal should  be very careful when it is not boosted though, as Golem and Rhydon can  OHKO it. In addition, Acid Armor's 64 PP is great for stalling Recover  or Softboiled users during the late-game. Blizzard rounds the set by  offering extra power and 8 more Ice-type PP. While Ice Beam is strong  enough to even have a chance to 2HKO Tauros, the extra power will often  be welcome. Slash and Explosion are also available options; the former  3HKOes opposing Cryogonal and does some damage to Lapras. Explosion can  surprise special walls, but it is so weak that it only does around 60%  to Starmie without a critical hit&mdash;in fact, most Pokemon will  take more damage from Blizzard. Simple but effective, and being able to  force stall plays and have the upper hand on them, Cryogonal would be a  very common Pokemon in RBY.</p>

<h3>Golurk</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/653.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>89 / 124 / 80 / 55 / 55</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>NU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>mid-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Earthquake / Body Slam / Rock Slide / Hyper Beam</dd>
</dl>

<p>Golurk holds a very unique typing that makes it immune to Normal-type  attacks including Explosion, as well as to Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt.  It also provides a very strong STAB Earthquake that Golurk can back up  with an excellent base 124 Attack stat. On the flip side, Golurk is weak  to Ice-, Water- and Grass-type attacks, which coupled with the low  Special stat typical of Ground-type Pokemon means that Golurk can be  2HKOed by Chansey, Starmie, and Tauros among others. Earthquake is the  move Golurk will be using most of the times; it 2HKOes Chansey, OHKOes  Gengar and Jolteon&mdash;two Pokemon that Golurk can check  well&mdash;and almost always 3HKOes Snorlax. Golurk makes an  effective Snorlax check, being immune to its Normal-type attacks and not  taking super effective damage from Earthquake. Golurk also fares well  against Golem and Rhydon, being faster than both and hitting them for  super effective damage while taking neutral damage back; however, both  Golem and Rhydon are physically stronger. As far as the moveset is  concerned, Body Slam can paralyze checks like Starmie and Exeggutor and  cripple Tauros and Dragonite with a bit of luck. Golurk's Earthquake is  so restrictive that its last two moves will rarely be relevant, but Rock  Slide, Hyper Beam, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt stand out the most (Golurk  does not learn Blizzard).</p>
 
<h3>Bouffalant</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/656.png" alt="" /></p>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>
<dd>95 / 110 / 95 / 55 / 95</dd>
<dt>Status in the new generations:</dt>
<dd>RU</dd>
<dt>Expected RBY Status:</dt>
<dd>top-tier OU</dd>
<dt>Possible RBY Moveset:</dt>
<dd>Body Slam / Earthquake / Swords Dance / Hyper Beam</dd>
</dl>

<p>Bouffalant has to inevitably be compared to Tauros. These two are not  only very similar in appearance, but also in battle qualities.  Bouffalant is bulkier than Tauros, especially on the special side,  reaching almost Snorlax-like defenses, and has slightly higher attacking  stats. However, Bouffalant is much slower; while it's still faster than  many important Pokemon, the low Speed also means that Bouffalant's  critical hit rate is half of that of Tauros, and we all know that the  critical hit rate is a huge part of what makes Tauros as scary in RBY as  it is. Bouffalant learns a very nice move, however: Swords Dance. After  a single boost, most neutral Pokemon will be OHKOed by Hyper Beam, and  every Pokemon not named Cloyster will be 2HKOed by Body Slam or  Earthquake. Bouffalant could also opt for Surf, as thanks to its base 95  Special stat, it will OHKO Golem and Rhydon. Unfortunately, Bouffalant  learns no other special move, but you can't possibly deny that its  movepool is still more than good enough. Bouffalant is just another  Normal-type monster, and like we saw with Ursaring, Bouffalant makes a  pretty good reason for people to strongly consider to triple up on  Normal-type physical sweepers if the afro Tauros had existed.</p>

<p>Heatmor is a Fire-type Pokemon with good attacking stats and, most  importantly, access to Amnesia. With Fire Blast, Heatmor has a very good  chance of 2HKOing Tauros. After one Amnesia boost, Fire Blast will 2HKO  Golem and Rhydon, and at +4, it will 2HKO Chansey and Starmie and OHKO  Alakazam and Snorlax. In addition, Fire Blast's 30% chance to burn will  cripple any physical attacker instantly. These calculations may make you  too optimistic about Heatmor, but unfortunately, Heatmor has to live  with low Speed and Defense stats and weaknesses to Earthquake and Surf.  Golem and Rhydon resist Fire Blast, and although they still take  relevant damage from it and could get burned, come very close to OHKOing  Heatmor back with Earthquake. Surf Starmie and Slowbro are almost  impossible to get by, if not straight up impossible; fortunately,  Starmie doesn't run Surf very often. Heatmor has some things going for  it, however. With above average special bulk and neutrality to BoltBeam,  it can set up on Chansey pretty well, taking negligible damage back  after a boost. Heatmor can also make a decent answer to Exeggutor,  although it takes around 33% damage from Psychic. Fire Spin adds a bit  to Heatmor's usefulness; while it's not an especially effective move due  to its sub-par accuracy and Heatmor's average-at-best Speed, it may  help against Snorlax, Golem, or Rhydon in certain situations or help  scout the opposing team. Slash rounds out the set due to its ability to  2HKO Alakazam; it does some damage to Starmie as well. Overall, it's impossible to accurately determine whether Heatmor would have been able  to make it to the OU tier in RBY, but it sure has some potential.</p>

<h3>Meloetta</h3>

<dl class="pokemoninfo">
<dt>RBY Stats:</dt>

<dd>Psychic / Thunderbolt / Body Slam / Thunder Wave</dd>
</dl>

<p>If there is one thing better than being a Normal-type or a Psychic-type  Pokemon in RBY, it is... being both types at the same time! Thanks to  its typing, Meloetta gains STAB on Normal-type attacks as well as on  Psychic, in addition to being resistant to opposing Psychic and having  no weaknesses in return. Moreover, Meloetta holds a very high BST,  highlighted by an outstanding Special stat that makes its Psychic almost  as strong as Alakazam's&mdash;its critical hit rate is not all that  much lower either. Meloetta's special bulk is also exceptional, being  even higher than Exeggutor's. Its physical bulk is not bad by any means  either, being around Tauros's level. On the offensive side, Meloetta can  hit every non-Psychic-type Pokemon other than Chansey very hard with  its powerful Psychic, while Chansey and Alakazam won't be taking STAB  Body Slams lightly&mdash;remember that not being a Flying-type and  having a body was enough in order to have access to Body Slam in RBY.  Thunderbolt offers coverage against Water-types, being specially useful  against Starmie and Slowbro, both of which will go down to two hits.  Thunder Wave rounds out the set due to its ability to cripple offensive  Pokemon and ease the job against Chansey and Alakazam. Considering Body  Slam is also able to score paralysis, Hyper Beam is a viable option;  thanks to STAB, it does over 55% to Chansey and over 70% to Alakazam and  may also come in handy for finishing off weakened Exeggutor, Jynx, or  opposing Meloetta. Needless to say, Meloetta's movepool also contains  Sing; it is inaccurate, but it can catch opponents off-guard and  Meloetta has the bulk to afford a miss. Meloetta may not have had the  ability to change its form in the first generation, but as you see, it  wouldn't have needed it to succeed in the RBY OU metagame.</p> 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this second part of the article, we have arguably found more variety  of Pokemon than in the first part. Apart from the Normal-type attackers  and Amnesia users that were all over the place in the first part, in  this issue we have also been able to witness, for example, two  Ghost-types, two special walls with access to Recover, three sleep  inducers, and three Pokemon that are evolved forms of already existing  RBY Pokemon. Of course, the pool of types and roles is still limited  compared to what we would expect from a newer generation, but from a RBY  standpoint, we can consider that all the Pokemon detailed in the  article make up for a pretty diverse and colorful combination.</p> 

<p>So, in general, what conclusions can we take from this article? First,  that the types of Pokemon that dominate RBY don't depend on the RBY  Pokemon specifically, but on the RBY mechanics and move availability.  What I mean by this is that Normal- or Psychic-types don't dominate RBY  because its holders have an exceptionally good movepool or stats as much  as because these types are just very good in RBY. Between the first and  second part, a total of 12 Pokemon were either Normal- or Psychic-type  (or both), with translates to 40%. Other very good RBY types such as  Water, Ground, Rock, and Ghost also make many appearances in the  article. Second, that we should thank Nintendo for giving Amnesia a very  sparse compatibility. Between the two parts, we have witnessed a total  of ten Amnesia users, five of them from ADV. Everybody that plays RBY  knows how much luck-based Slowbro is, so more viable Amnesia users would  very likely make the RBY metagame even more luck-oriented.</p> 

<p>After reading the whole article, we can get an idea of what the RBY  metagame is missing. Some non-Ground Rock-types found their way into OU  thanks to not being weak to Ice-type moves or quadruple weak to Water-  and Grass-type moves. Two Ghost-types also made an appearance, as they  are great for absorbing the overly present Normal-type attacks in RBY,  including Explosion. In addition, unlike Rock-types and Gengar, the two  featured Ghost-types aren't weak to Earthquake, the most powerful  coverage move of Snorlax and Tauros. Speaking of Normal-type checks,  it's more than clear that RBY lacks a physical wall. We saw that Miltank  would be a tremendously useful Pokemon by being the perfect counter to  all physical Pokemon, and Cofagrigus, while having to rely on Rest to  recover damage and having less offensive presence, made its way to OU by  being able to check Tauros and Snorlax. Two interesting type  combinations we have been able to see are Ice / Ground and Water /  Ground, as the Pokemon that holds either of them would be immune to  Thunder Wave while not being weak to BoltBeam from the common Chansey  and Starmie. While it's true that the two Pokemon we saw with these  characteristics are also Amnesia users, it is clear that these are very  interesting types to have in RBY, as they also provide useful mixed  STABs. Lastly, as far as the Ubers metagame is concerned, we have seen  that a Normal-type behemoth like Slaking or Regigigas would've been  interesting to break Mewtwo's total dominance and potentially make the  metagame more fast-paced and varied. Another interesting Pokemon was  Regice, a perfect Mewtwo check thanks to Amnesia and immunity to freeze.</p>

<p>So the article ends here! I sincerely hope you have enjoyed this  two-part article from the beginning to the end! Hopefully, this article  has also help you understand a bit more about what the RBY metagame  looks like and what are the reasons the top-tier RBY Pokemon are as good  as they are in RBY. While limited and arguably very luck-oriented, RBY  is always a fun metagame to play and I strongly encourage you to try it  out if you haven't already!</p>
