Overview
########

Ludicolo is the only fully-evolved pokemon in the game that has its type combination which is above-average both offensively and defensively, and is a force to be reckoned with when it has rain to play in. This turns Ludicolo into a decent rain abuser, with an excellent speed stat after the Swift Swim boost. Add his nifty 4x resistance to water into the mix, meaning that opposing Water-types can't abuse the rain also provided that Ludicolo is in. However, it isn't all good news for Ludicolo, as it is weak to the common Flying- and Bug-type attacks, as well as the Poison-type attacks which are gaining popularity due to the introduction of the Fairy-type. Furthermore, when it is outside of the rain its stats are no better than middling, meaning that it is completely reliant on the rain to succeed in the OU tier. Because of this, Ludicolo recieves stiff competition from Manaphy, Kabutops and Kingdra as rain sweepers in the OU tier, all of which have better overall stats, require less team-support and are less reliant on rain to succeed. However, once you look past these drawbacks, you see that Ludicolo is in no way a bad pokemon, as it is still a force to be reckoned with its excelent, unique typing and blazing speed under the rain.

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is a monsterous move when the rain is active, gaining many OHKOs and 2HKOs on pokemon which do not resist it. However, if you are on the side of accuracy in that endless war between power and accuracy, you can run Surf, although you must remember that it will miss out on many KOs and that it is more reliant on rain than Hydro Pump to hit hard. Giga Drain is the Grass-type STAB of choice for Ludicolo as it hits with decent power, covering the Water-types that like to come in and sponge Ludicolo's hits, while also providing healing for Ludicolo. Ice Beam is there to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types which resist both of Ludicolo's STAB moves, although when attacking Dragonite it may be a good idea to break its multiscale first to minimise the chance of activating its Weakness Policy. Finally, Rain Dance is there so that Ludicolo can activate rain itself if it so requires, although it is often best to switch out so that something else can set it up for Ludicolo.

Set Details
========

The given EVs are simple: maximise Ludicolo's speed while providing as much punch as possible. Life Orb is used to aid Ludicolo in this respect as it can boost its power to monsterous levels in the case of Hydro Pump and to boost them to usable levels for its other moves. A modest nature has been chosen in order to boost Ludicolo's power further as well as due to the fact that Ludicolo will mostly be attacking under rain as it is, making a timid nature redundant. Swift Swim is used so that Ludicolo actually has some sweeping capabilities, as its speed stat is otherwise middling.

Usage Tips
========

Due to the weather nerf this generation, Ludicolo now has a limited number of turns in which to abuse the rain, so play Ludicolo with precision (ie. land all of your predictions: Ludicolo doesn't have enough time to using Hydro Pump against something that resists it). However, you will find that Ludicolo will still be using Hydro Pump most of the time anyway due to its raw power when under rain. Make sure that the rain is alway up when you bring Ludicolo in: if it means sacrificing your Politoed to get the rain up so be it. Refresh the rain as much as possible, although nine times out of ten it will be best to have something other than Ludicolo set up the rain through Rain Dance or Drizzle. Also make sure that you remove anything that can prevent Ludicolo from successfully sweeping, such as Talonflame and Ferrothorn.

Team Options
========

Politoed, most notably the Damp Rock variant, is an amazing partner for Ludicolo for obvious reasons, as simply switching it in successfully is all the time it needs to get the rain up due to Drizzle. Kingdra mutually benefits Luudicolo as they share the same set of checks and counters offensively, giving you a backup plan when one of them faints. Rotom-Wash is capable of dealing with Talonflame effectively without messing up Ludicolo's rain, making it a valuable asset on any team that features it. Rapid Spin users, most notably Tentacruel due to Rain Dish and its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes upon switch-in, are able to deal with Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes, both of which plague Ludicolo due to the fact that they limit Ludicolo's sweeping capabilities and wear it down quickly, respectively. On the subject of Toxic Spikes, anything with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy to get rid of paralysis, burn or poison from Ludicolo is an excelent teammate as Ludicolo hates all three of these statuses. Finally, Conkeldurr and Lucario can deal with Ferrothorn effectively, although the former must be wary of Rocky Helmet variants and the latter must be wary of Thunder Wave and, depending on weather it is physically or specially based, the aformentioned Rocky Helmet variants.

Other Options
########

Ludicolo has a massive movepool to abuse. However, most of Ludicolo's other options are either outclassed by the options listed or another pokemon who can do the job much better. First of all, Ludicolo can run Choice Specs for its ability to ease prediction a little, getting a guaranteed 2HKO on Latios with Hydro Pump. However, aside from the fact that the combination of Life Orb Hydro Pump in the rain and Life Orb Ice Beam 2HKO Latios anyway, the main issue that it faces when it uses this is the fact that Ludicolo needs the ability to switch moves if it wants to do anything useful in the OU tier, as a Choice Specs set is outclassed by all of the pokemon listed in the overveiw excluding Kabutops, who is physically-based anyway. Energy Ball could be used over Giga Drain for the extra power output and Focus Blast gives Ludicolo a way to deal with Ferrothorn; however Ludicolo misses the healing that Giga Drain provides while Focus Blast gives Ludicolo a case of four-moveslot syndrome. On the subject of alternative moves, Scald can be used over Surf or Hydro Pump for the burn chance. However, you will often find that it lacks in power compared to said moves, missing out on many KOs even when it does burn. Finally, Ludicolo has access to Rain Dish which could warrent a tank set with Assault Vest. However, the lack of permanent rain this generation diminishes the usefulness of such a set dramatically, so it is not recommended.

Checks and Counters
########

**Super Effective Damage**: Talonflame doesn't care about Swift Swim due to Gale Wings and can OHKO Ludicolo with Brave Bird 100% of the time. Also, Mega Venusaur doesn't care about Ice Beam due to Thick Fat and can hit Ludicolo hard with a STAB Sludge Bomb.

**Anti-Rain**: Anything that can change the weather from rain, most notably Mega Charizard Y who can OHKO with a sun-boosted Fire Blast - and if the mega evolution is predicted and Ludicolo uses Rain Dance, Modest variants can always OHKO with Air Slash whereas Timid variants will still OHKO 68.8% of the time - and Mega Tyranitar who can outpace in sandstorm and OHKO with Stone Edge 100% of the time, is an effective way of dealing with Ludicolo, although Ninetales and regular Tyranitar must be wary of Rain Dance.

**Hard Hitters**: Kyurem and Kyurem-Black shrug off everything that Ludicolo can throw at them with ease and deal heavy damage back with Draco Meteor or Outrage, respectively, and Assault Vest Conkeldurr can tank Ludicolo's attacks although, as a rain-boosted Hydro Pump will hurt a lot, it must get a free switch-in against Ludicolo or predict an Ice Beam or Giga Drain correctly and it can threaten Ludicolo back with a powerful Drain Punch or Knock Off.

**Walls**: Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur wall Ludicolo to no ent and can retalliate back with Knock Off or Sludge Bomb, respectively. Furthermore, any special wall, such as Chansey, Blissey or Assault Vest Goodra, can tank whatever Ludicolo throws at it and stall out Ludicolo's rain with ease.

**Anti-Speed Tactics**: Trick Room leaves Ludicolo in a predicament as Ludicolo is forced to use the rain to have any sort of offensive presence, and Trick Room just flips this on its head. Ludicolo also hates Paralysis as it completely negates the effects of Swift Swim. This means that common users of the move, such as Ferrothorn and Thundurus, are able to cause massive problems for Ludicolo. Finally Sticky Web, while having less of an effect on Ludicolo than paralysis, is still detremental for Ludicolo. This makes Galvantula - the most common user of the move - a check to Ludicolo, as well as being able to 2HKO Ludicolo with Bug Buzz while taking whatever Ludicolo throws at it with its trusty Focus Sash.

**Wearing-Down**: Toxic and Will-O-Wisp are able to wear Ludicolo down quickly in conjunction with the Life Orb recoil. While I'm still talking about Toxic, Toxic Spikes also get this powerful timer onto Ludicolo by inflicting the poison or bad poison statuses onto Ludicolo. Finally, the combination of entry hazards and phazers increase the speed at which Ludicolo gets worn down further.
