  <div class="aside">After asking a wombat for directions I finally found him.</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="Aim"/>Hey! Thanks for agreeing to this! I know you are a busy man breeding kangaroos and chasing dingos, so I'll hop right into this.</div>
  <div class="speaker NewBreed"><img class="NewBreedImg" src="/competitor/articles/interview_newbreed.png" alt="" />Ah, thanks! Yes, the dingo chasing especially really takes up a lot of my time but I'm happy to give some to you :]</div>
  <div class="aside">I smirked. In the corner of my eye, I could see one of the wild dogs running into the horizon. Crikey!</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="Aim"/>Haha. Congratulations on winning the UU Open! It must be pretty exciting to have gone all the way.</div>
  <div class="speaker NewBreed"><img class="NewBreedImg" src="/competitor/articles/interview_newbreed.png" alt="" />Yeah, it was both exciting and fun. I'm glad it's over with though, as those 5 day rounds were so annoying, lol.</div>
  <div class="aside">I nodded my head in agreement. Time to get down to business.</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="Aim"/>They definitely were! Did you expect yourself to do as well as you did?</div>
  <div class="speaker NewBreed"><img class="NewBreedImg" src="/competitor/articles/interview_newbreed.png" alt="" />Never. At the start of the UU Open, I honestly considered any UU point that I got as a bonus; a few things just went my way, I guess.</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="Aim"/> Ah, I see. How did you prepare for the tournament?</div>
  <div class="speaker NewBreed"><img class="NewBreedImg" src="/competitor/articles/interview_newbreed.png" alt="" />During the early stages, I just built up a good amount of solid teams and mostly used what I felt most comfortable with. Nearing the end, it became more about specific building to hopefully get at least an even matchup or better.</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="Aim"/>By "specific building", you mean counter-styling, right?</div>
  <div class="speaker NewBreed"><img class="NewBreedImg" src="/competitor/articles/interview_newbreed.png" alt="" />Yes, just making sure I'm familiar with the types of playstyle(s) they like to use and making sure that I'm not at a disadvantage from turn one.</div>
  <div class="aside">God bless Showdown! replays. I took a sip of some "Billy tea" and continued.</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="Aim"/>The replay is one hell of a function haha. You faced a lot of notable opponents: Kokoloko, Calloflochie, and Bad Ass are a few that come to mind. Were there any opponents you were most nervous about or prepared the most for?</div>
  <div class="speaker NewBreed"><img class="NewBreedImg" src="/competitor/articles/interview_newbreed.png" alt="" />The replay is your best friend. In terms of being nervous, that didn't really happen at all just because I never expected to make it that far from the start. I was definitely most prepared for Bad Ass, as it was the Semi-finals, and he is well known for being one of the best XY UU players going around at the moment.</div>
  <div class="aside">Definitely a wise decision. I nodded, understanding.</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="Aim"/>That makes sense. After defeating Bad Ass, you ended up playing Lowgock in the finals. What was your mindset preparing/going into those games?</div>
  <div class="speaker NewBreed"><img class="NewBreedImg" src="/competitor/articles/interview_newbreed.png" alt="" />Mindset wise I was quite confident that I could get the job done after knocking out Bad Ass who was, imo, the favorite to win the whole tournament at that point. Preparing was just about making sure the teams I used were not only really solid but also somewhat unorthodox; the best example of that I can give is my g2 team that utilized a hazard-based Stall which you're almost never going to see anywhere in UU, let alone a final lol.</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="Aim"/>I'll take your word for it, considering you won, haha. Once again man, congratulations! Was there a particular set or team that performed extraordinarily during the tournament for you?</div>
  <div class="speaker NewBreed"><img class="NewBreedImg" src="/competitor/articles/interview_newbreed.png" alt="" />Thanks, much appreciated :]. If I had to single out just one set I think it would have to be Mixed Victini. The set was V-Create / Thunder / Grass Knot / Dazzling Gleam; there was almost no core in UU at the time that could reliably beat this. CB Krookodile was also really good for me; I went like 5-0 with CB Krookodile on bulky offense.</div>
  <div class="aside">Just call him CTC Jr., The UU Based Lord himself.</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="Aim"/>The innovation! That's very impressive, man. You not only won UU Open but are currently second in standings, qualifying for the play offs. What are your expectations of the play offs?</div>
  <div class="speaker NewBreed"><img class="NewBreedImg" src="/competitor/articles/interview_newbreed.png" alt="" />Honestly I'm not too confident that I'll do well lol. There are a few people currently in the top 8 spots such as Afro Smash and yourself who have more overall knowledge of the six tiers, and I think in the end whoever can be the most consistent in them all will win. So I have a lot of work to do if I want to win lol.</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="Aim"/>Anything is possible in Pokemon! Any last words before we wrap this up?</div>
  <div class="speaker NewBreed"><img class="NewBreedImg" src="/competitor/articles/interview_newbreed.png" alt="" />Yeah, nothing is ever certain with this game. Just a shout-out to the people that helped me during the UU Open, such as Hot N Cold and Calloflochie, who really supplied me with a solid base of teams. Also, thanks for taking the time to interview me, fren :]</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="Aim"/>No, man, thank you! Good luck with the rest of Slam!</div>
  <div class="aside">And with that I ran out, literally for my life, as a dingo chased me all the way back to my plane.</div>
