Reduces damage from a super effective Flying-type attack by 50%. Consumed after use.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by a Pokemon, reduces the power of a damaging Flying-type move that would hit the holder for super effective damage by 50%. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Flying-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Even among the type-resistance Berries, Coba Berry isn't particularly good. While there are pretty strong Flying-type moves to watch out for, such as Hurricane from Tornadus or Dragonite, the last thing you really want to be doing is attacking either of these two with something that would ordinarily be weak to their most ferocious STAB attack. Other than that, there are few Pokemon for whom their Flying-type weakness would prevent them from setting up, or else is their principal weakness, so Coba Berry can often go a bit wasted.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Wild Sunkern and Sunflora (5%).</p>
<p>Receive from Fennel on first visit to Dream Worldâ€”however, you only get one of the seventeen damage-reducing Berries, and this event cannot be repeated. If you do not receive a Coba Berry in this way, you must trade for it using Share Shelves in the Dream World.</p>
