Overview
########
Generation 6 brought a lot of changes to scizor. Xerneas is a brand new threat that scizor is well-placed to check. Furthermore it possesses a lot of utility for stall teams in that it is capable of checking mega-gengar with pursuit and bullet punch. It also has gained a mega-evolution, which is all round a bit bulkier and slightly faster, whilst retaining offensive capabilities. The increased presence of Ho-Oh due to defog removing all hazards, and the birth of Mega-Blaziken are significant drawbacks for it however, as is its loss of its dark and ghost resistances. Overall, despite its clear weaknesses, its strong typing and various forms of utility give it a meaningful place in the ubers metagame.


Support
########
move 1: Bullet Punch
move 2: Roost
move 3: Superpower / Pursuit
move 4: U-turn / Toxic / Knock Off
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Bullet Punch does at least 54% to bulky Geomancy Xerneas after Stealth Rock. Roost provides healing and is massively useful. Superpower deals heavy damage to ekiller and Chansey, whereas Pursuit gives it the opportunity to handle Mega-Gengar, however it should run the specially defensive spread mentioned in Set Details. U-turn and Toxic both are useful moves for opposing switch-ins, whilst Toxic is especially useful in handling Calm Mind Arceus-forms. Knock Off disrupts the foe's items, which is often incredibly helpful. Any of the moves in the last slot can be useful in handling opposing Ho-oh. Defog, whilst not listed, is a fantastic support move that Mega-Scizor can use, but may struggle pulling it off against more offensively-oriented teams. Scizor can rarely afford the moveslot to run Sword Dance, but it can help to pursuit-trap Aegislash, and clean up late-game.

Set Details
========

Light Metal is used since when it megavolves it regains technician anyway, and it potentially can reduce the power of Low Kicks/Grass Knots that it switches in on, albeit a rare circumstance. It is also useful when ditto switches in before you're megavolved and leaving it without the boost of technician. It is difficult to bluff a band set with technician since there is such a drop in power, so Light Metal is generallly the most useful. A spread of 248 HP / 16 Atk / 116 Def / 128 SpD Adamant can be used as an exchange of power for bulk without stopping it being capable of checking Xerneas and ekiller sufficiently. 248 HP / 16 Atk / 244 SpD Adamant is still capable of almost always 2HKOing standard Geomancy Xerneas but because of the increased special bulk it is the recommended spread for trapping Mega-Gengar. It should also be noted that it can deal at leas 54% damage to bulky ekiller with Superpower. 248 HP EVs reduces stealth rock damage.

Usage Tips
========

Unless Scizor is using a specially-defensive spread, it has difficulty switching directly into Xerneas, but can deal significant damage to it before being attacked. The main spread can deal a minimum of about 57% to standard Geomancy Xerneas. You should inflict prior damage upon Xerneas before, if possible, to put it into KO range for Scizor. Ekiller should likewise be put into KO range for scizor with superpower; the main spread can deal at least 63% to bulky ekiller, whilst doing at least 71% to offensive ekiller. Scizor ideally has to double switch into Mega-Gengar, and must beware Hidden Power Fire as well as Destiny Bond. Bullet Punch can also be used to revenge kill heavily weakened pokemon. Scizor has few other opportunities to come in versus offensively oriented teams, meanwhile against less offensive teams it should use any free turns it generates to generally disrupt the foe.

Team Options
========

Scarf Zekrom pairs nicely as it can take care of Ho-Oh and Kyogre, whilst Mega-Scizor checks both ekiller and Xerneas, and they also can form a volt-turn core. For a team relying on it to pursuit-trap mega-gengar, naturally options that require that form of support, such as defensive Xerneas. Other teammates that can handle fire types and other threats that get a free switch on Scizor, such as Kyogre, are ideal. You should also carry a second check to Geomancy Xerneas if you are using it to pursuit-trap Mega-Gengar, such as Ho-oh, should you lose Scizor to Destiny Bond.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Bullet Punch
move 2: Superpower
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Technician
item: Choice Band
evs: 248 HP / 212 Atk / 48 Def
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Bullet Punch allows it to check Xerneas. Superpower allows you to heavily damange ekiller. U-turn and Knock Off are to either gain momentum or disrupt switch-ins. Pursuit allows it to trap notably Mega-Gengar, but is much less reliable at this role.

Set Details
========

Choice Band gives it a lot of power. Is a guaranteed 2HKO with bullet punch versus most Xerneas,. The defensive EVs allow it to not be OHKOed by Jolly LO ekiller with earthquake after a Sword Dance boost, after stealth rock, whilst at full health. 248 HP / 20 Atk / 48 Def / 192 SpD and Careful can take Focus Blast from Xerneas after a Geomancy boost and 2 stealth rocks, whilst still hitting hard. 248 HP EVs reduces stealth rock damage.

Usage Tips
========

Unless using the bulkier set, this set struggles to switch in versus opposing Xerneas, and still requires some prior damage to defeat it, however it can deal a minimum of 75% damage with Bullet Punch versus Geomancy Xerneas. It also deals a minimum of 83% to bulky ekiller. It tends not to switch in during many other parts of the game due to its relative frailty in ubers, especially since it requires what bulk it does have to defeat certain set-up sweepers. Bullet Punch can also be used for revenge killing. Knock Off and U-turn allow it to disrupt more defensively-oriented teams.

Team Options
========

The best pokemon to pair with it are those which offensively check pokemon that obtain a free switch on it, such as Ho-oh, Kyogre, and Blaziken. Because of this pokemon such as Palkia, Zekrom, and Arceus-Ground pair well with it, able to come in on these pokemon and threaten them. Zekrom can form a volt-turn core with Scizor, whilst Palkia and Arceus-Ground enjoy being able to switch in safely and land a free hit.

Other Options
########

Bug Bite is a stronger bug-type STAB. Tailwind is quite gimmicky, but in combination with U-turn it could be quite powerful, providing sweeping opportunities for teammates. Lum Berry is also an option to soak up a Will-o-Wisp. Assault Vest could be used but the power drop is significant. Baton Pass is an option but suits very few players or teams. Thief deserves a small mention as being consistent and in some situations stronger than Knock Off, for examples against megas such and arceus forms, particularly ghost arceus.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire types** Ho-Oh is a particularly potent threat, although it dislikes Knock Off and Toxic, whilst other Fire attack users such as Blaziken and Mega Charizard X can set up on it too.

**Physically Bulky Pokemon** Rocky Helmet Skarmory punishes U-Turn spam, and if it doesn't carry defog can set up spikes on it. Aegilash hates knock off, sword dance and pursuit, however is otherwise a solid check. Landorus-T and Gyarados only fear toxic and knock off, whilst gliscor fears nothing and can also taunt it. Mega-Aggron can laugh at anything Scizor tries to do.

**Will-o-Wisp** Support Arceus forms and Giratina can burn it, leaving Scizor neutered, but cleric support can remedy this.

**Kyogre** Physically Defensive Kyogre outright doesn't care about Scizor, whilst other sets only mind Toxic, Knock off, or U-turn. Specs Kyogre can practically use Water Spout for free.

**Thundurus** It can taunt to stop roost and defog, whilst hitting hard with a strong electric STAB attack, although it dislikes taking too many hits.

**Hazard Setters** Forretress and Klefki don't mind Scizor, and can set up spikes unless it carries defog.

**Fire Attacks**Other fire attack users include Genesect, Palkia, and Dialga, who can use powerful fire attacks to destroy it, although fantastic checks. Hidden Power Fire and Fire Blast from unexpected pokemon, such as Mega Gengar and Xerneas can really cause it trouble.

**Zekrom** Zekrom can 2HKO but fears Toxic and Knock Off.
