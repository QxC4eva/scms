Overview
#######
- Massive 135 HP stat and good 85 Special Defense stat allow it to tank almost any special attack.
- Good 85 attack allows it to hit hard with moves such as Body Slam, Fire Punch, and Earthquake
- Thick Fat allows Munchlax to absorb Fire- and Ice-type moves very well.
- 40 Defense is quite low, and only 5 Speed means that Munchlax will be outsped by every Pokemon in Little Cup.
- Faces competition from Porygon for a Normal-type tank.

Berry Juice 
##################
Name: Physically Offensive Tank
Move 1: Body Slam / Return
Move 2: Fire Punch
Move 3: Curse / Earthquake / Toxic
Move 4: Recycle
Ability: Thick Fat
Item: Berry Juice
Nature: Adamant / Impish
EV's: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 SpDef

Moves
======
- Body Slam is a great STAB that allows Munchlax to do good damage while also trying to paralyze its opponent.
- Return is a more powerful STAB option, but it doesn't have the chance to paralyze.
- Fire Punch hits Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Bronzor hard, while also being Munchlax's only reliable way of hitting Levitating Ghost-types. 
- Curse gives Munchlax a much needed boost in Defense while giving it more power to KO potential counters. 
- Earthquake can be used to hit Rock-types. 
- Toxic can be used to counter standard Will-O-Wisp Misdreavus (without Substitute or Heal Bell). 
- Recycle and Berry Juice act as a 20 HP recovery if Munchlax is below 50%. 

Set Details
=========
- Thick Fat allows Munchlax to actually counter Pokemon such as Larvesta and Ponyta, even with his low physical defense.
236 Attack EV's make Munchlax as strong as possible, while 236  Special Defense EVs make Munchlax as bulky specially as possible. 36  Defense helps slightly boost his defense.
- An Adamant nature further adds to Munchlax's power, but as the difference from 18 to 19 is not a major one, adding a point into Defense from 11 to 12 can be used as well with an Impish nature (or with 156 Atk / 116 Def / 236 SpD and an Adamant nature). 
- An alternative spread with more Defense allows Munchlax to switch into Murkrow. 

Usage Tips
=========
- Munchlax is a great switch into most special-based attacks due to its great special bulk.
- Should throw around Body Slam liberally unless a Ghost-type is around. 
- Keep Munchlax away from Knock Off, as it removes Munchlax's ability to recover HP.
- With Curse, let Munchlax weaken a prospective Fighting-type switch-in such that it can absorb a Drain Punch and still KO back after a Curse. 
- Keep away from status. 

Team Options
===========
- Pokemon that can switch into Fighting-types like Trubbish can help cover Munchlax's weakness to physical Fighting-type attacks. 
- Pawniard is not necessarily a counter, but it can switch into an attack and set up Swords Dance and KO if Munchlax is weak enough. Mienfoo helps remedy this. 
- Munchlax helps patch up weaknesses to Pokemon like Magnemite and Chinchou. So Murkrow would use Munchlax's pivoting capabilities quite well. 
- It hates status, so Aromatherapy or Heal Bell users such as Spritzee and Misdreavus are exceptional teammates. 

RestTalk
##################
Name: RestTalk
Move 1: Body Slam / Return
Move 2: Fire Punch / Curse / Whirlwind
Move 3: Rest
Move 4: Sleep Talk 
Ability: Thick Fat
Item: Eviolite
Nature: Adamant / Impish
EV's: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 SpDef

Moves
======
- Body Slam is a great STAB that allows Munchlax to do good damage while also trying to paralyze its opponent.
- Return is a more powerful STAB option, but it doesn't have the chance to paralyze.
- Fire Punch hits Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Bronzor hard, while also being  Munchlax's only reliable way of hitting Levitating Ghost-types. 
- Curse gives Munchlax a much needed boost in Defense while giving it more power to KO potential counters. 
- Rest and Sleep Talk give recovery while not being useless while asleep. 
- Curse is an option but Munchlax's limited moveslots from Rest and Sleep Talk make it hard to fit in, and it will be completely walled by Ghost-, Rock- and Steel-types if it chooses to use it.

Set Details
=========
Thick Fat allows Munchlax to actually counter Pokemon such as Larvesta and Ponyta, even with its low physical Defense.
236  Attack EV's make Munchlax as strong as possible, while 236  Special  Defense EVs make Munchlax as bulky specially as possible. 36 Defense helps slightly boost its Defense.
An  Adamant nature further adds to Munchlax's power, but as the difference  from 18 to 19 is not a major one, adding a point into Defense from 11 to  12 can be used as well with an Impish nature (or with 156 Atk / 116 Def  / 236 SpD and an Adamant nature). 

Usage Tips
=========
- Munchlax is a great switch into most special-based attacks due to its great special bulk.
- Should throw around Body Slam liberally unless a Ghost-type is around. 
- With Curse, let Munchlax weaken a prospective Fighting-type switch-in such  that it can absorb a Drain Punch and still KO back after a Curse. 
- Can absorb status unlike the Berry Juice variant, but lacks the reliable recovery without Sleep. 

Team Options
===========
- Pokemon that can switch into Fighting-types like Trubbish can help cover Munchlax's weakness to physical Fighting-type attacks. 
- Pawniard is not necessarily a counter, but it can switch into an attack and set  up Swords Dance and KO if Munchlax is weak enough. Mienfoo helps remedy this. 
- Munchlax helps patch up weaknesses to Pokemon like Magnemite and Chinchou. With that in mind, Murkrow would use Munchlax's pivoting capabilities quite well. 
- If Munchlax does not use Fire Punch or another Ghost-type hitting move, it is a good idea to have something like Scarf Pawniard to Pursuit Ghost-types away. 

Other Options
##########
- Outrage to hit Ghost-types harder, but more vulnarable vs Steel-types. 
- Pursuit to trap Pokemon such as offensive Misdrevious.
- Sunny Day/Rain Dance for dedicated Rain/Sun teams.
- Belly Drum can be used since it has good bulk, even though it's low. Trick Room can be used to remedy it's Speed but and could give it 3-4 turns which would likely translate to 3-4 KOes if used properly. 

Checks & Counters
#############

**Fighting-types**: such as Meditite, Meinfoo, Timburr, and Crogunk all do massive damage to Munchlax.

**Rock-types**: can easily take Body Slam, Return, or Fire Punch.

**Ghost-types**: depending on Munchlax's moveset, Ghost-types may have an easy time setting up on Munchlax. They can also burn the first set with Will-O-Wisp.
