<p>Hello, fellow trivia enthusiasts, and welcome back to another round of Trivia! Something appears to have happened to Zystral again, but nevertheless, we'll still be proceeding with our normal schedule! Well... almost.</p>

<p>First, though, let's take a look at last issue's Trivia treasure hunt! I'm sure you'll agree with me that this was really badly executed; not only were some of the clues rather odd, but we also forgot to hide the pages in question in Google searches! As such, we had almost 20 responses&mdash;a new record for Trivia submissions&mdash;most of which were entirely correct. In light of this rather distressing situation, I must with a (not so) heavy heart announce that we are not giving out prizes this round. Apologies to all of you who actually solved the treasure hunt the "proper" way but have failed to receive a prize due to our incompetence (well, to be fair, even if we gave out prizes you probably wouldn't get them because you would've been outsped by purveyors of Google and other search engines). We sincerely hope that you had fun over the course of the hunt nonetheless.</p>

<p>Just in case you got stuck halfway, the hunt should have taken you across Smogon in the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Start) "Let's get the <em>dice</em> rolling. Find a Smog article."<br />
<a href="/smog/issue20/control_luck">Playing with Loaded Dice: How to Control Luck</a></li>
<li>"Dice is cool and all, but the Pokemon he <em>uses</em> will <em>never</em> make it into the <em>Hall of Fame</em>. Find a page in smogon.com/tiers/!"<br />
<a href="/tiers/nu/hof">NU Hall of Fame</a></li>
<li>"I heard <em>XY</em> is making a splash. How did Smogon handle all the <em>research</em>? Find a hub!"<br />
<a href="/xyhub/research">XY Hub - Research Resources</a></li>
<li>"How <em>competitive</em> is BKC? Find an article!"<br />
<a href="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc">The Competitor: Interview with BKC</a></li>
<li>"Getting Smogon to work was the greatest <em>priority</em> when Smogon moved to XenForo. What's even more <em>useful</em> than that? Find a BW article!"<br />
<a href="/bw/articles/priority">BW Move Priority</a></li>
<li>"In an issue of The Smog, we celebrated Pok&eacute;mon Biology on the issue cover! Where do you think the next clue is?"<br />
<a href="/smog/issue25/pokemon_biology">Pok&eacute;mon Biology: Conditional Evolution</a></li>
<li>"The Smog awards is underway! Find the article with the first Smog Award winners."<br />
<a href="/smog/issue6/smog_awards">Smogon Awards Winner 2009</a></li>
<li>"The final clue is here! Of course we're going to have to ramp up the difficulty. An amazing art piece was declared the Best Piece of Art in The Smog Awards 2012. Find that article with that absolutely astounding piece for the final clue and question."<br />
<a href="/smog/issue22/featured_rmt_uber">Featured Ubers RMT</a> (End!)<br />
"Congratulations on making it this far! Now here's the final question: <strong>List all the Pokemon whose average is exactly 90.</strong>"</li>
</ol>

<p>If you like, you can go through the series of pages to see if you can get the correct answers, which should be Gyarados, Snorlax, Kingdra, Blissey, Milotic, Electivire, Magmortar, Darmanitan-Z, and Haxorus. You all should be pleased to know, though, that to make up for last issue's disappointment, we've decided to give readers a chance to exact their revenge upon us for our terrible misdeeds&mdash;this issue, you'll get to submit your own Trivia questions!</p>

<p>Simply send five, and only five, questions to The Smog in a PM titled "Issue 33 Trivia"! We'll only look at the first five questions in your PM, and we'll select the best 10 to be published in next issue's Trivia. If one of your questions is selected, not only will you be acknowledged next issue, but you'll also be able to claim a shiny new Custom Title as your prize!</p>

<p>All the best, Trivia connoisseurs!</p>
