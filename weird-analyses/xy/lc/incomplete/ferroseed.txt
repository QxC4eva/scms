SET NAME
#######
name: Utility
move 1: Leech Seed
move 2: Bullet Seed / Gyro Ball
move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: Thunder Wave / Protect / Spikes
Ability: Iron Barbs
Item: Eviolite
Evs: 84 HP / 36 Atk / 188 Def / 148 SpD / 36 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
=======
Leech seed gives you both recovery and passive damage. best way of keeping ferroseed healthy and supporting team
bullet seed best stab option with berry juice and sturdy so common. its better than bullet seed cause fuk tirtouga.
stealth rock is the best hazard in the game and works best in an offensive metagame cause you dont have enough time to set up multiple layers of spikes
thunder wave gives your team support by letting them take outspeed the fast stuff like swirlix and misdreavus
protect lets you scout and gives your leech seed more value
spikes if you want that many hazards
gyro ball is a reliable steel stab hitting everything you want to hit for good damage.
if you do not need Stealth rock on ferro, you can use any of the other three moves instead.
Set Details
=======
evs are set to maximize overall bulk. 22 hp / 18 def / 18 spd is really bulky with an eviolite
eviolite is better than berry juice on ferroseed because it needs it to take weaker super effective hits and because it has some recovery through leech seed
berry juice is an option but honestly eviolite lets it take a fire attack so thats amazing.
if utilizing gyro ball, drop speed evs, use Sassy nature, and drop Speed ivs to 0 to maximize damage
Usage Tips
=======
ferroseed is supposed to come in on grass and water types and set up hazards immediately
use thunder wave on obvious switch ins to cripple them
leech seed a lot so you stay alive
attack when you are trying to grind something out becase you should win with leech seed and bullet seed
Team Options
=======
Spritzee is loved by ferroseed as they are good at covering each others weaknesses, while also helping keep each other alive with wish / leech seed
mons who enjoy twave support such as things like houndour and honedge are good teammates
things to soak fire hits such as chinchou, houndour, or ponyta as a lot will be aimed at ferroseed.
fighting resists like misdreavus and gligar are great
murkrow and swirlix like stealth rock
Other Options
#######
toxic because bulk and protect is fun
iron head is generally going to be weaker than gyroball because it does 80 base power against 16 speed mons so yeah.
seed bomb hits as a reliable stab option, but honestly fuk tirtgoua
honestly thing things movepool is barren it cant use anything else worth using lol
Checks and Counters
#######
fighting types. meditite and mienfoo come to mind as they enjoy forcing switches a lot
fire types: houndour ponyta larvesta all wreck you
while grass types do nothing to you, you do nothing to grass types.
set up bait for things like gligar or Misdreavus
defog. vullaby and gligar
Pawniard sets up stupidly easily and doesnt mind twave because of sucker punch
i should seperate them more or no?
murkrow can come in almost free if you arent running steel stab.
