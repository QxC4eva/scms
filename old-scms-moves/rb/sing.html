<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Puts the target to sleep.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sing has little competitive use. While the sleep status is powerful, Sing's accuracy is awful and too unreliable in most situations. However, there are times when the risk of missing with Sing is worth it. The best example is with an extremely bulky Pokemon like Chansey; Chansey forces nearly every special attacker out, meaning Chansey will have a lot of chances to hit the incoming Pokemon with Sing and usually permanently cripple it thanks to the sleep mechanics; however, Chansey is often better spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave instead.</p>
