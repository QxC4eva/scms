<p>So basically, here's the line:</p>

<p>There was literally over 500 people. if you are going to a VGC event, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GET THERE an hour early. The line will be long, trust me.</p>

<p>Here's me with my two friends:</p>

<p>Oh, and here's gold, being humped by Jade (a new friend i made at the VGC).</p>

<p>The whole place was set up like this:</p>

<p>As you beat more people, the more you progress onto the right. You start off with Green, Purple, Orange, then finally Yellow.</p>

<p>To start off, you get into a line and you wait until a staff member registers you. Then they proceed to give you a wristband. THEY ALSO GIVE YOU AN EXCLUSIVE BLACK "HEART GOLD&amp;SOUL SILVER" BAG! MAKE SURE YOU GET IT! Afterward, they lead you to a table.</p>

<p>They also give you this slip of paper. Every time you beat an opponent, you would advance to the next color. A staff member would always circle if you won or not.</p>

<p>OHH THERE WAS ALSO A DANCING PIKACHU THAT WAS FREAKKIN AWESOMMEEEEE! (Picture of me and all my friends at the VGC)</p>

<p>Merriland was at the event. Here's a pic of him, along with Paul (Zerowing) in the background. It's blurry, I know. I didn't want Paul or Merriland to think I was a creeper.</p>

<p>Oh, and an announcer guy came up to my "group" and asked if we would be able to dance with Pikachu for a dance-off thingy. We agreed, and he said it'll be up on the internet... I wonder where it is :/</p>

<p>Here's some videos on the semi-finals and finals. Enjoy!</p>
