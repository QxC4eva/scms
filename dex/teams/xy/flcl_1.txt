[name]
FLCL team 1

[overview]
This is a basic offensive team for the NU tier. It focuses around a defensive core of Vileplume and Seismitoad, which cover most offensive threats in the tier.

[pokemon]
Vileplume @ Leftovers
Ability: Effect Spore
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe
Bold Nature
IVs: 0 Atk
- Aromatherapy
- Synthesis
- Giga Drain
- Sludge Bomb

Vileplume serves as the team's physical tank, checking Feraligatr, Fighting-type Pokemon, Belly Drum Slurpuff, Shiftry, and non-Acrobatics Sceptile. While most of the team doesn't mind Paralysis, a burn on Pawniard or Toxic on Gurdurr can greatly hinder the effectiveness of the team. Aromatherapy is useful for keeping the team healthy. However, Leech Seed could also be used to help heal the team and prevent certain Pokemon from setting up.

[pokemon]
Seismitoad @ Leftovers
Ability: Water Absorb
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
Sassy Nature
- Stealth Rock
- Scald
- Knock Off
- Earth Power

Seismitoad is both the hazard setter and special tank of the team. It is able to easily check most Water-type Pokemon that don't carry Grass-type coverage, Qwilfish, Archeops, Fire-type Pokemon, Rhydon, and some variants of Dragalge. Seismitoad forms a good defensive core with Vileplume, as there aren't many Pokemon that one of the two can't check.

[pokemon]
Pawniard @ Eviolite
Ability: Defiant
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
Adamant Nature
- Swords Dance
- Knock Off
- Iron Head
- Sucker Punch

Pawniard acts as a Physical sweeper and a Defog and Sticky Web deterrent. STAB Knock Off is an excellent weapon in this metagame, as there aren't many good Pokemon that resist Dark and can afford losing their item. Fairy-type Pokemon aren't safe, because Iron Head does a ton of damage if they mispredict and switch into it. Sucker Punch allows Pawniard to revenge kill frail or weakened offensive Pokemon easily.

[pokemon]
Cryogonal @ Icicle Plate
Ability: Levitate
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
Timid Nature
- Rapid Spin
- Ice Beam
- Freeze-Dry
- Recover

Cryogonal acts as the spinner of the team and also as an offensive threat versus some spikes-stacking teams. Freeze-Dry allows Cryogonal to hit Seismitoad, Omastar, and Qwilfish super effectively, which is important as Cryogonal can then Rapid Spin their hazards away without the threat of them setting up again. The rest of the move set is standard, though Life Orb can be used over Icicle Plate if you feel Cryogonal isn't doing enough damage.

[pokemon]
Gurdurr @ Eviolite
Ability: Guts
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def
Adamant Nature
- Bulk Up
- Drain Punch
- Knock Off
- Mach Punch

Gurdurr is a very good bulky set-up sweeper, since most Pokemon that resist or are immune to Fighting-type moves are weak to Knock Off. In addition, if Gurdurr is statused, Guts boosts its power and allows Gurdurr to recover almost enough HP to make up for it with Drain Punch. Even though Gurdurr carries Eviolite, it resists Knock Off and can boost its defense to make up for the loss.

[pokemon]
Rotom @ Choice Scarf
Ability: Levitate
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
Timid Nature
- Volt Switch
- Thunderbolt
- Shadow Ball
- Trick

Rotom is the team's Choice Scarf user, and a catch-all check to many faster threats in the metagame. It can help gain momentum for the team through Volt Switch, and can Trick the Scarf onto troublesome Pokemon such as Spiritomb or Slurpuff to hinder their effectiveness.

Usage tips
==========
Don't be afraid to switch around a bit with the team in order to get yourself in a good position. Even if you mispredict, the most members of the team are bulky enough to handle being hit with a super effective move.

Checks & Counters
============
Slurpuff is extremely dangerous if allowed to set up either Belly Drum or Calm Mind + Cotton Guard. It resists both forms of priority that the team carries, so the best way to handle it is to just hit it hard and try to activate its Sitrus Berry before it's ready to set up.

Some variants of Shiftry or Archeops may be hard to handle if they're running weird coverage (Extrasensory on Shiftry, Hidden Power Grass on Archeops). Don't panic if your opponent surprises you though, as the team is bulky enough in general to deal with these threats.
