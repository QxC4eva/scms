<p>Boosts the user's Special Defense by two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Amnesia is a pretty unique move in that it is the only move in the game capable of raising a Pokemon's Special Defense stat by two stages in one turn. Sadly, that's about as special as it gets. Most Pokemon that get the move can't really do much with it, either due to being more susceptible on the physical side or simply being easy to wear down. Even a Pokemon like Slowbro, for whom you would expect the move to be perfect, cannot afford to run it due to its difficulty in running all the moves it needs on one set. Slack Off, Fire Blast, Ice Beam, Psychic, and Scald are all much more important to Slowbro's welfare, and Calm Mind is generally considered a better option regardless.</p>
