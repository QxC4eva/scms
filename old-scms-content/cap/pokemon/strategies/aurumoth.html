<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Aurumoth enters this world from a higher plane for one purpose: to bring despair and destruction wherever it goes. With 120 / 117 / 94 offenses, fantastic bulk, and an Olympic-sized movepool, Aurumoth can usually find a way to sweep even the most prepared teams. Offensively, its weak point is obviously its middling base 94 Speed, but it has three different methods of instantly becoming lightning-fast: Dragon Dance, Quiver Dance, and Choice Scarf. Because Aurumoth is so deadly with a single Speed boost, almost every major set is focused on obtaining a Quiver Dance or Dragon Dance boost. Aurumoth has two abilities that facilitate its sweep: Illusion allows the moth to disguise itself as a teammate and steal a boost while the opponent switches, while No Guard cranks up Aurumoth's power by letting it use moves such as Thunder, Hydro Pump, Blizzard, and Focus Blast without the possibility of missing. If Aurumoth decides to use its superior Attack stat, it has Dragon Dance, Megahorn, Zen Headbutt, and Close Combat at its disposal. Although it's difficult to forgo boosting Aurumoth's Speed, it's entirely reasonable to tap into Aurumoth's vast support movepool, which includes Trick, Magic Coat, Wish, Will-O-Wisp, and Healing Wish.</p>

<p>With all of those weapons, how does one defeat Aurumoth? First of all, throwing down Stealth Rock on its side of the field is imperative. If Aurumoth takes a different amount of damage from Stealth Rock than the Pokemon it's disguised as, then its Illusion will be worthless. The same concept applies to Spikes and Toxic Spikes: if the opponent's Spikes-immune Pokemon takes Spikes damage, then it's obviously Aurumoth in disguise. If Aurumoth has no Illusion, then it's almost definitely a No Guard special attacker. Pokemon such as Heatran and Choice Scarf users faster than Aurumoth, and Tornadus-T can all cause Aurumoth trouble. Wearing down Aurumoth with entry hazards, revenge killers, and Life Orb recoil is the most painless way to knock out the moth.</p>

<p>This set combines three of Aurumoth's deadliest features: Quiver Dance, Illusion, and a massive special movepool. Illusion is what separates Aurumoth from OU's other Quiver Dance user, Volcarona. Illusion allows Aurumoth to disguise itself as a Pokemon that will draw in something it can use Quiver Dance against, preferably masquerading as a defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn that will draw Fighting-type moves that don't faze Aurumoth. Another advantage to disguising Aurumoth as a defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn or Gastrodon is that the opponent might not immediately attack a defensive Pokemon because of its lack of being an immediate threat. Quiver Dance boosts Aurumoth's already high Special Attack, patches up Aurumoth's low Special Defense, and allows it to outpace every Pokemon in OU without a boost. Bug Buzz shreds any Pokemon that doesn't resist the move besides Blissey and Chansey.</p>

<p>While Aurumoth should always use Bug Buzz and Quiver Dance, its massive movepool lets it pick and choose what Pokemon it wants to counter. A secondary STAB, specifically Psyshock or Psychic, usually fills Aurumoth's third slot. Psychic lets it knock out any Fighting-type that stands before it, while Psyshock trades a bit of power for a much stronger hit on Blissey and Chansey. If Aurumoth uses Leftovers over Life Orb, then Psychic should be used over Psyshock. With Leftovers, a Quiver Dance-boosted Psychic can knock out Lucario in one hit, but a Timid Psyshock will always spare the jackal. Psyshock also fails to defeat Keldeo and Terrakion in a single hit, and both of those Pokemon pose significant threats to Aurumoth, especially if the bug does not have a Quiver Dance boost. Hydro Pump and Surf are Aurumoth's best options for the final slot because of the wonderful neutral coverage they provide. Hippowdon, Gliscor, Heatran, and Volcarona, all Pokemon that can defeat or force out Aurumoth, are mowed down by Surf or Hydro Pump. Hydro Pump is recommended because it defeats specially defensive Heatran with a Life Orb after Stealth Rock, but Surf is more consistent and just as viable. Ice Beam allows Aurumoth to freeze Dragon-types before they can launch an attack, but watch out because most Dragon-types will outpace Aurumoth without a Quiver Dance boost.</p>

<p>Aurumoth has fantastic bulk for a setup sweeper, and Leftovers allows Aurumoth to set up on many defensive Pokemon and doesn't waste its health on recoil damage. However, Life Orb cranks up every one of Aurumoth's moves significantly, and Aurumoth's Special Attack sits at an above average base 117, which is only below that of other special sweepers such as Thundurus-T, Genesect, Reuniclus, and Alakazam. Modest is the best nature to use on Aurumoth, as its middling Speed is just too low to make a Timid nature preferable. However, Timid is still a viable nature to use on Aurumoth because a Timid Aurumoth outpaces Rotom-W, Adamant Haxorus and Salamence, all Landorus-T,and Jolly Lucario. For a Modest nature, a standard set of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe allows Aurumoth to force a Speed tie against other Aurumoth and Jolly Gyarados and always outspeed positive natured base 80 Pokemon. If Timid is selected, then Aurumoth can trade some of its Speed EVs for HP EVs; a spread of 24 HP / 252 SpA / 232 Spe still outspeeds every relevant Pokemon slower than Aurumoth.</p>

<p>Politoed is a natural teammate for Aurumoth, as Politoed's Drizzle ability nullifies Aurumoth's weakness to Fire-type attacks and powers up Hydro Pump and Surf. In the same vein, Thunder becomes a great option for Aurumoth if Politoed is a teammate because Thunder fries Tornadus-T, Gyarados, and Jellicent, all of which can defeat Aurumoth with a Flying-type attack or cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic. Although it's not as potent as Thunder, Thunderbolt is a viable coverage option for Aurumoth despite the lack of STAB and its suspect power. Genesect's ability to force switches and blistering U-turns make it an excellent partner in crime for Aurumoth, as it means that Aurumoth not have to worry about finding safe switch ins. This is especially important because Aurumoth will likely have to switch into Stealth Rock and begin shelling out 10% of its health per turn with Life Orb. Do note, however, that both of these Pokemon do not take the same amount of damage as Aurumoth does from Stealth Rock. Aurumoth will take 25% of its health from Stealth Rock, while Genesect and Politoed will only lose one-eighth of their health, which immediately tips the opponent off to Aurumoth's Illusion. To remedy this, it is important to bring a Rapid Spin user such as Forretress or Tentacruel or disguise Aurumoth as a Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock. Dragonite and Salamence are both threatening Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock, and they have completely different counters than Aurumoth does. For that reason, the two aforementioned Dragon-types make excellent teammates. Remember though: it is dangerous to disguise Aurumoth as a Pokemon immune to Spikes, as if the opponent sees your Dragonite taking Spikes damage, they'll know it's really Aurumoth!</p>

<p>Not satisfied with Aurumoth's power output? Wish that Aurumoth could hit just a little bit harder? Well, have I got a set for you! For a limited time only, Aurumoth can use its No Guard ability to fire off inaccurate attacks without worrying about missing! That's right, no longer will your Aurumoth deal with Thunder missing, Blizzard missing, or any pesky Focus Blasts missing either! Order now, and receive a Life Orb, free of charge!</p>

<p>This set eschews Illusion in favor of extreme power and coverage. There is one drawback to No Guard, and that is that every attack aimed at Aurumoth will hit, including Fire Blast and Stone Edge. With this set, Aurumoth cannot rely on the opponent's poor luck with low-accuracy moves, but that is a minor risk compared to the reward of Aurumoth's powerful attacks. Quiver Dance is one of the best boosting moves in the game, cranking up Aurumoth's Special Attack to obscene levels, patching up its suspect Special Defense, and allowing it to outpace any Pokemon slower than a Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Additionally, this set has three 120 Base Power moves with perfect accuracy; Blizzard ices any Pokemon weak to it, most notably Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Salamence, Latios, and Latias. Ground-types, such as Hippowdon, also take a beating from Blizzard. Blizzard smacks Thundurus-T out of the sky as well. Thunder, Aurumoth's second weapon, fries Water-types such as Politoed, Keldeo, and Gyarados. Be warned, however, that Aurumoth does not outspeed Choice Specs Keldeo without a boost and is outpaced by Choice Scarf Keldeo even with a boost. Psychic, on the other hand, is a viable replacement for either of those moves if Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Toxicroak need to be dispatched in one hit. Thunder and Blizzard have such great coverage together that it's hard to give one up, but remember that Psychic, thanks to STAB, hits opponents harder than either Thunder or Blizzard.</p>

<p>The final slot can go one of two ways. Focus Blast takes care of Terrakion, Mamoswine, Ferrothorn, Heatran, Magnezone, and Mamoswine and is Aurumoth's best bet against Blissey and Chansey, while Bug Buzz rips Deoxys-D, Meloetta, and Mew; Bug Buzz also provides Aurumoth a reliable STAB that hits harder than Blizzard, Thunder, and Focus Blast. The choice between Focus Blast and Bug Buzz is the classic question of power versus coverage, but No Guard and the number of Pokemon that fear Focus Blast usually makes the former the better option. Although the lack of STAB is disheartening, a Life Orb-powered 120 Base Power attack with a chance to freeze or paralyze the foe is powerful and worth it. One draw to using STAB on this set, however, is the perfect neutral coverage (barring Shedinja) between Psychic, Bug Buzz, and Focus Blast. </p>

<p>As you're tossing aside Illusion in order to use this set, Life Orb is the superior item for Aurumoth. Leftovers is viable, of course, but this set is about acquiring power quickly and easily with little regard to bulk. Modest is the best nature for this Aurumoth set, especially because this set intends to use as much immediate power as it can accrue. Timid is still a good nature; Aurumoth is not gifted in the Speed department and needs a boosting nature to outpace Landorus-T, Adamant Haxorus, and neutral nature base 100s. The EVs are straightforward: it allows Aurumoth to outspeed Dragonite, Venusaur, and Mamoswine, Speed tie with Jolly Gyarados, and maximize Aurumoth's power. Again, shifting 20 EVs from Speed to HP is reasonable if Aurumoth opts for a Timid nature, as Aurumoth only needs 232 Speed EVs to outpace every Pokemon with a lower base Speed. Although maxing Speed is certainly viable, there are no Pokemon in OU that reside between Aurumoth and Landorus-T.</p>

<p>Just like Psychic, Psyshock gets perfect neutral coverage besides Shedinja with Bug Buzz and Focus Blast, but it trades a bit of power to defeat Blissey and Chansey. Psyshock's power is nothing to laugh at; it hits just as hard as Thunder or Blizzard, but on the opponent's Defense stat rather than their Special Defense. A perfectly accurate Hydro Pump is also no joke, and rain support from Politoed turns Hydro Pump into Aurumoth's most powerful attack. Entry hazard control is not as important as it is for the Illusion set, but any Pokemon using Life Orb and weak to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes would rather not have to deal with those hazards on the field. On the other hand, placing Stealth Rock and Spikes on the opponent's side of the field makes Aurumoth a happy little insect because it helps stop Pokemon like Genesect from stepping in and threatening to revenge kill Aurumoth. Preferred teammates include Terrakion to rough up Blissey and Chansey and provide some physical offense to complement Aurumoth's special offense. Heatran can stop Jirachi, which can step in and Body Slam Aurumoth while sponging its attacks. </p>

<p> Not only can Aurumoth disguise itself as whichever Pokemon it pleases, it can also run two entirely different sets with entirely different counters. Dragon Dance Aurumoth is a deadly physical sweeper that mows down any Pokemon that checks the Quiver Dance sets besides Genesect. The premise of the set is the same as the premise of the first set: disguise Aurumoth as a Pokemon that threatens the opposing team and then boost Speed and an attacking stat. This set also packs more power than the Illusion Quiver Dancer, as Aurumoth's Attack is greater than its Special Attack, and Megahorn's 120 Base Power dwarfs Bug Buzz's 90. Zen Headbutt is weaker than Psychic and has an annoying 90% accuracy, but it's Aurumoth's strongest physical Psychic-type attack and still has a sweet chance to make the opponent flinch. Close Combat knocks out Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn that try to sponge the first two attacks. Close Combat is also Aurumoth's best bet against Skarmory, but the tin bird can just Whirlwind Aurumoth away. Dragonite and Latios make nice partners; the former shares Aurumoth's Stealth Rock weakness while the latter can draw out Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, which Aurumoth can remove. Both of those Dragon-types are known for luring Jirachi, which Aurumoth can soften up for the Dragon-types to knock out.</p>

<p>Life Orb is Aurumoth's best friend; the item lets Aurumoth secure countless OHKOs and 2HKOs that Aurumoth needs to sweep opposing teams. Leftovers isn't preferable because this set does not even consider boosting a defensive stat and is not as concerned with Aurumoth's bulk. However, Aurumoth is a bulky Pokemon by nature, and there is nothing wrong with using Leftovers on a bulky sweeper. Although Life Orb and Leftovers are the two premier options for Dragon Dance Aurumoth, Lum Berry allows Aurumoth to bluff Choice Scarf or Expert Belt while absorbing Toxic or Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Tentracruel and Rotom-W. The EVs look familiar for a reason; unless Aurumoth is using a Speed-boosting nature, it cannot lower its Speed any further. Adamant is the preferred nature to crank up Megahorn's power and compensate for Zen Headbutt's power issues. Jolly, on the other hand, ensures that the opponent cannot outspeed Aurumoth with a Pokemon with a lower base Speed. Furthermore, a Jolly nature will prevent other Jolly Aurumoth from consistently defeating it.</p>

<p> Aurumoth distinguishes itself with Illusion and its high Speed compared to other Dragon Dance users such as Dragonite. Illusion is the centerpiece of this set, and it is important to disguise Aurumoth properly to give Aurumoth time to use Dragon Dance. Dragonite and Salamence are two good choices for partners, as they both use Dragon Dance without raising suspicion as to whether or not Aurumoth is in disguise. However, both the aforementioned Dragon-types and Aurumoth have similar counters, so it is also wise to disguise Aurumoth as a lure for a Pokemon Aurumoth can defeat. Starmie can spin hazards away and lures Pokemon such as Blissey, Chansey, and Ferrothorn, all of which are defeated by Aurumoth's Close Combat. Disguising Aurumoth as a wall such as Blissey, Chansey, or Ferrothorn is crafty because they lure physical attackers and Fighting-types, both of which Aurumoth has a field day against by virtue of its high Defense and Bug / Psychic typing. Teammates that use Rapid Spin make Aurumoth a happy insect because Rapid Spin helps preserve Aurumoth's Illusion and keep its health high. Remember, however, that most Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce users share either Aurumoth's Fire-type weakness or its Dark-type weakness, so be sure to include extra insurance against those types if Aurumoth is paired with Forretress, Espeon, or Starmie. Heatran, the quintessential anti-metagame Pokemon, makes a great partner for Aurumoth because it absorbs the Fire-type moves that make Aurumoth quiver and sets up Stealth Rock to weaken Aurumoth's counters. In return, Aurumoth sponges the Earthquakes that knock out Heatran and defeats the special walls that Heatran fails to break.</p>

<p>With two great moves that boost Aurumoth's Speed, one may question why Choice Scarf Aurumoth is so potent. However, one glance at this set reveals the answer: Final Gambit. Final Gambit transforms Aurumoth into a deadly Choice Scarf user because thanks to Final Gambit, Aurumoth can knock out at least one of the opponent's Pokemon with near certainty. A full-health Aurumoth can do 424 points of damage to any Pokemon (besides Ghost-types, who are immune to the move) that switches into it. Furthermore, Aurumoth will not lose its HP if a Ghost-type switches in! Other than Ghost-types, there are four Pokemon in the entire tier that can switch into a maximum power Final Gambit and live to tell the tale: Blissey, Chansey, Gastrodon, and Vaporeon. The latter two cannot switch into Stealth Rock and still survive a Final Gambit.</p>

<p>Because Aurumoth easily forces switches thanks to Illusion, the opponent will almost always lose their Aurumoth counter to Final Gambit. Furthermore, Aurumoth still has a pair of attacking moves if it doesn't choose to sacrifice itself. Megahorn, although it's backed up by just 4 Attack EVs, still puts a dent in anything that's weak to it and allows Aurumoth bluff a Dragon Dance set. It's the same deal with Zen Headbutt, but remember than an uninvested Zen Headbutt really lacks power. The primary use of this set is to use Final Gambit, not to revenge kill opponents in a traditional sense. The final slot has two viable options: Trick and Close Combat. Trick immediately alerts the opponent that Aurumoth is a Choice Scarf user, but if you disguise Aurumoth as a common Trick user, there is a chance to keep the opponent fooled. Close Combat wallops Steel-types, but because most Steel-type Pokemon have a great Defense stat, Aurumoth will probably fail to OHKO them. Trick is usually the better option in this case; Close Combat is only superior if your team has serious issues with Steel-types.</p>

<p>The EVs are geared for a max-powered Final Gambit and enough Speed to revenge kill other Aurumoth. Always use a Jolly nature with these moves; the purpose of this set is to unleash an ultra-fast Final Gambit, not to attack or defend. Illusion is the ability to use because it lures specific Pokemon into the field. If the opponent has not seen any of Aurumoth's moves, then they will likely assume it's a special attacker. For this reason, Blissey and Chansey are common switch-ins to this set. If the opponent has a Blissey or Chansey on their team, then do not use Final Gambit carelessly.</p>

<p> Final Gambit eliminates the Pokemon that switch into Aurumoth. For that reason, Pokemon that play similarly to Aurumoth make great partners. Volcarona, Swords Dance Scizor, Agility Thundurus-T, and Rock Polish Landorus-T come to mind as Pokemon that benefit from the removal of walls. Do note that many of those Pokemon are weak to Stealth Rock and that Aurumoth still prefers to preserve its Illusion, so Rapid Spin users make great partners for Choice Scarf Aurumoth. Furthermore, entry hazards eat into Final Gambit's power. Once Aurumoth starts wasting its health to hazard damage, its Final Gambit fails to take out the sturdier walls of OU, such as Hippowdon and Jirachi. None of the three premier spinners of OU have particularly great synergy with Aurumoth: Starmie shares Aurumoth's Dark-type weakness, Forretress shares Aurumoth's Fire-type weakness, and Tentacruel struggles to break Ghost-types such as Jellicent. In terms of type synergy, Aurumoth does pair best with Tentacruel, and Forretress can still get out of sticky situations with Volt Switch.</p>

<p>Aurumoth can select specially offensive moves such as Hydro Pump, Psychic, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Bug Buzz to replace the physical attacks on the current set. Remember that if Aurumoth wants to use a special Choice Scarf set, then it should use a Timid nature instead of a Jolly nature. Another benefit of using special moves such as Thunderbolt, Psychic, and Ice Beam is that Aurumoth can disguise itself as a Starmie without arousing suspicion. Starmie's Rapid Spin and Aurumoth's Illusion can make the two a dynamic duo despite the poor type synergy. It's reasonable to drop Aurumoth's Speed EVs to 232 and dump the extra 24 points into Attack, but then Aurumoth cannot reliably defeat its fellow Aurumoth. The last move that Aurumoth could potentially use is Overheat because it defeats Steel-types without sacrificing Aurumoth to a Final Gambit, but Overheat forces Aurumoth to switch out&mdash;potentially into entry hazard damage&mdash;just to use a Overheat from little to no Special Attack investment.</p>

<h2>Other Options</h2>

<p>Remember when I said Aurumoth had an Olympic-sized movepool? Well, it's time to jump off the deep end. Every specially offensive set&mdash;and even the Choice Scarf set&mdash;can use Thunder, Blizzard, Overheat, or Hydro Pump over any of the coverage moves listed on the analysis. Choice Scarf Aurumoth can use No Guard and these moves in order to bluff the No Guard special attacker, but the lack of Life Orb recoil will tip the opponent off to Aurumoth's trickery. Although this set is outclassed by faster Choice Scarf users such as Latios, Aurumoth can use a full-out No Guard Scarf set with Thunder, Blizzard, Bug Buzz, Hydro Pump, Focus Blast, and Psychic as move options, along with maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs. Lum Berry can bluff a Choice Scarf on all of the stat-boosting sets and heal status conditions. Furthermore, direct status-afflicting moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Thunder Wave do not break Aurumoth's Illusion. Expert Belt gets an obligatory mention on any setup sweeper that would like to bluff a Choice Scarf or avoid Life Orb recoil, making Expert Belt a great choice for the No Guard Quiver Dance attacker. Expert Belt and Illusion causes some difficult mind games with the opponent because they have to rationalize the lack of Leftovers recovery, Life Orb recoil, and the Illusion all at once.</p>

<p>A defensive set with Quiver Dance and Will-O-Wisp or Wish is viable, but giving up the raw power of the Quiver Dance attacking sets is risky business. Wish, with or without Quiver Dance, is a sweet healing move that can support Aurumoth's team. However, Aurumoth is designed to receive support from its team, not the other way around. Quiver Dance and Will-O-Wisp form a tantalizing duo because Quiver Dance patches Aurumoth's weak Special Defense and Will-O-Wisp makes the insect nearly impenetrable from the physical side. Healing Wish is a tricky move that provides great team support, but the only Aurumoth set that should consider sacrificing itself is the suicide-prone Choice Scarf set. Hydro Pump on any specially offensive Aurumoth set is even better in the rain, especially if Aurumoth has No Guard. If Aurumoth is running Illusion, then Surf is the less risky option. Bumping Aurumoth's Speed EVs to 252 removes the risk of being outsped by another Aurumoth and allows Aurumoth to at least Speed tie other Aurumoth. Reflect and Light Screen are great moves for Aurumoth to use, but they are better if one of Aurumoth's teammates is using them! </p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>

<p>Countering Aurumoth? Don't make me laugh! Aurumoth has the coverage options to defeat just about any Pokemon that stands in its way. However, Aurumoth cannot use all of its coverage moves at once, and most teams naturally have at least one Pokemon that forces Aurumoth to think twice. The first step to reducing Aurumoth's HP to zero is to identify the set, which is no easy task. If Aurumoth has no Illusion, then it's most likely a special attacker. On the other hand, a set with Illusion could be either physically or specially offensive. Choice Scarf Aurumoth are nearly unpredictable, as whatever you switch in is most likely going to get blasted with a Final Gambit. Surrounding Aurumoth with Stealth Rock and Spikes are a great way to whittle its health closer to zero. If the opponent switches in a Pokemon that takes an incorrect amount of damage from hazards, then it's an Aurumoth hiding behind an Illusion.</p>

<p>Heatran can take on Aurumoth reasonably but needs to watch out for Surf, Hydro Pump, and Close Combat. The best way to drop Aurumoth is to just blast it with a powerful attack from a Pokemon faster than it. Tornadus-T, Genesect, Landorus, and Keldeo all outpace the moth and can either OHKO or nearly OHKO it. An attack from one of the aforementioned Pokemon plus the damage from Life Orb and entry hazards will always be enough to knock out Aurumoth. Quiver Dance sets have problems with Fire-types and Choice Scarf users with physical moves. Choice Scarf Landorus with Stone Edge is as close to a universal counter as anything; just beware of how risky it is to rely on Stone Edge to counter a Pokemon as powerful as Aurumoth. Tornadus-T's supreme combination of Speed, power, and Special Defense makes it a near-universal answer to Aurumoth. Choice Scarf Keldeo is a great revenge killer if rain is active, as a rain-boosted Hydro Pump will crush Aurumoth if it has taken prior damage. Keldeo's Fighting typing allows it to even switch into a boosted Megahorn or Bug Buzz if necessary. Genesect can withstand one of Aurumoth's attacks and roast it with a Flamethrower. Any Choice Scarf user with a decent Special Attack stat can finish off a Dragon Dance Aurumoth; Latios, Keldeo, Infernape, and Hydreigon all come to mind. When all else fails, a Final Gambit from a Choice Scarf Aurumoth can knock out any Aurumoth set. The most important thing to remember when playing against Aurumoth is to be faster than it. Switching in your Choice Scarf user while Aurumoth is setting up usually forces Aurumoth to exit the battlefield.</p>
