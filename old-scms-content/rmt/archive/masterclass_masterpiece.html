<h2>The Team</h2>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/aegislash.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Aegislash</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Stance Change<br />
EVs: 236 HP / 252 SpA / 20 Spe<br />
IVs: 0 Atk<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Toxic<br />
- King's Shield<br />
- Shadow Ball</p>

<p>When i made this Aegislash moveset I knew I was gonna use Toxic. Which made the first 3 moves obvious: Shadow Ball, King's Shield and Toxic. I found substitute to be the best fit for the last slot because it really helps bring out the best from King's Shield and Toxic. In a way it allowed me to stall opponents with Toxic and in another way helped me abuse King's Shield to it's best. For it's ev spread I gave it 236 hp to gain maximum leftovers recovery and I just dumped 252 evs in SpAtk to gain the maximum damage output from Shadow ball. The remaining 20 evs I added to speed because it helped me outspeed most Aegislash, Clefable, and an uninvested tyranitar.</p>

<p><strong>Clefable</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Unaware<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD<br />
IVs: 0 Atk<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Moonblast<br />
- Heal Bell<br />
- Moonlight</p>

<p>Straightforward ev spread. The standard CM Clefable spread. Heal bell is the main reason I used clefable to purify Gyarados from paralysis. There's two sets to choose from really that go well with this team. This one, and the other being Wish/Protect/Moon Blast/Heal Bell. It's up to personal preference. Wish would give my team more support and longevity whereas Calm Mind would provide me with a win condition. They both work.</p>

<p><strong>Gyarados</strong> @ Gyaradosite<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 88 HP / 192 Atk / 4 Def / 224 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Ice Fang<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>This is the Star of the team. He probably wins most my games. It was really easy to just get in get a DD, and sweep. Both his typings were assets for me. It's flying/water typing is obviously the superior typing but don't overlook the Dark/Water typing. The amount of times it saved me from a boosted Mawile or a Bisharp are too many to count. For the Moveset it's the standard one. Waterfall for STAB, Earthquake to hit Rotom-W's and Aegislash and Ice fang for Latias, and Grass types. The EV spread had to be bulky seeing as I was planning on using Gyarados to take a few hits and aid me in defense. So I browsed it's Analysis thread and instead of using the Mega Gyarados ev spread I decided to use the Bulky one. The Speed evs allowed me to outspeed Noivren at +1.</p>

<p><strong>Latias</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 72 HP / 184 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
IVs: 0 Atk<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Psyshock<br />
- Roost<br />
- Defog</p>

<p>The reason i used Latias over Latios is because im a sucker for bulky pokemon. So if there's a bulky alternative to any pokemon, i'll go with it. Draco Meteor, Roost and defog are standard. The last move can vary depending on what you worry about most. HP Fighting can nail bisharps, hp fire can nail ferrothorns, thunderbolt can nail Azumarill's and Skarmory, and psyshock is for an extra stab that has good coverage with draco meteor and it provides an option vs venusaur.</p>

<p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Iron Barbs<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 SpD<br />
IVs: 0 Spe<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Leech Seed<br />
- Protect<br />
- Gyro Ball<br />
- Power Whip</p>

<p>Ferrothorn walls everything. By using Gyro Ball and Power Whip I provided my team with something great against Dragons, Offensive Waters, Bulky Waters and other fast sweepers on offensive teams. Gyro ball is there for things like Kyurem-B and Power Whip is for stuff like Sub Gyarados. The EV spread I used can be changed to anyones liking. I prefered a more physically defensive ferrothorn. The 40 Spdef evs allowed me to avoid a 2hko from +3 Manaphy and avoid the 3hko from a Life orb Greninja's ice beam. If you're more worried about thundurus you can opt for a more special defensive spread but from my experience it isn't necessary.</p>

<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/hippowdon.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Hippowdon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sand Force<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 112 Def / 140 SpD<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Slack Off<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Rock Slide</p>

<p>Moveset is standard. Rock slide is the prefered move to hit Charizard-Y on the switch in and to hit Mega Pinsir. The ev spread is for Hippowdon not to get 2hko'd by Aegislash's Shadow ball as well as survive Pinsir's Jolly +2 Return most of the time, and survive Bisharps +2 Knock off 100% of the time. </p>
