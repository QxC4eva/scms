Summons permanent sun.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Causes sun weather upon entering the battlefield. Instead of lasting 5 turns, it lasts the entire match, unless another weather is activated. If two weather inducers are sent out at the same time, the slower of the two will have their weather set up over the faster one. If sun weather was already induced via <a href="/bw/moves/sunny_day">Sunny Day</a>, sending out a Pokemon with Drought will make sun indefinite. Drought will immediately activate whenever the ability is acquired, such as through <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sun is, while often thought of as inferior to rain and sandstorm, a very powerful weather condition in its own right, and as such, Drought can spawn many different forms of team support and strategies. Many Grass-type Pokemon can now run <a href="/bw/moves/solarbeam">SolarBeam</a> without drawbacks, while getting their Speed boosted by the <a href="/bw/abilities/chlorophyll">Chlorophyll</a> ability. Examples of these include <a href="/bw/pokemon/tangrowth">Tangrowth</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/venusaur">Venusaur</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/victreebel">Victreebel</a>. The effects of <a href="/bw/moves/growth">Growth</a> are also doubled, so a Tangrowth can effectively gain a <a href="/bw/moves/nasty_plot">Nasty Plot</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/swords_dance">Swords Dance</a> on the same turn. Fire-type Pokemon can blast opposing Pokemon away with their double-STAB Fire-type attacks, while also losing their Water-type weakness.</p>
