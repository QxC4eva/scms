<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack and Special Attack by one stage. In sunlight, it will boost them by two stages.</p> 

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Growth became well known thanks to the added effect it received in BW along with Ninetales, the new Drought user. It has become one of the best set up moves for sun abusers, as a single turn allows one to sharply boost the two attacking stats. To put it in perspective, it's the boosts from Sword Dance and Nasty Plot paired together in a single turn. It transforms any Chlorophyll user that has access to this into a wreaking machine capable of overpowering entire teams as long as the sun is shining brightly. Venusaur, Shiftry, and Tangrowth are just a few of the Pokemon that become brilliant mixed sweepers as long these conditions are fulfilled.</p>
