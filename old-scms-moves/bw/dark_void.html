Puts the target to sleep.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Puts the target to sleep. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Pokemon with the abilities Insomnia or Vital Spirit are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The second best sleep-inducing move in the game, accuracy wise. However, it has fairly low distribution with only two users, Darkrai and Smeargle. For that reason, in singles Darkrai is the best user, since it possesses all the tools to abuse it: great Speed, excellent Special Attack, a good boosting move, and the right offensive movepool, not to mention its Bad Dreams ability. Dark Void is what makes Darkrai so truly terrifying to face, and you will rarely see Darkrai without it, or the threat of using it.</p>

<p>As for Smeargle, in singles there isn't any reason to not use Spore, as it has perfect accuracy. However, in double or triple battles, Dark Void serves a specific purpose, putting two adjacent Pokemon to sleep on the same turn. This is particularly noticeable in VGC tournaments where Smeargle is allowed, as there is no sleep clause to prevent an immediate turn 1 advantage.</p>
