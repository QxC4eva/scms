<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Speed one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>One could argue that lowering Speed is the best stat dropping tool available, but the opponent can just switch out, unlike paralyzed Pokemon which will remain inflicted with status. Moreover, Pokemon that can use String Shot are either too frail to use it efficiently or would rather be using a status-inducing move, should they survive a mere turn.</p>
