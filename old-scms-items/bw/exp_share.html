<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The holder of an Exp. Share gets a share of experience in battle as though it had participated. The points are first split into a half-share for Pokemon who actually participated, and a half-share for Exp. Share holders. These halves are then divided up normally. This results in a larger proportional share for Exp. Share holders who actually entered battle.</p>

<p>Exp. Share holders also gain a full amount of EVs, as if they had battled alone.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>An Exp. Share can be won from the Castelia City Battle Company; another one can be received as a gift from the Pok√©mon Fan Club Chairman for showing him a Pokemon that has grown by 25-49 levels since it was caught or received.</p>
