Confuses the target.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Confuses the target. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Confusion is an unreliable status effect as it is; banking on Supersonic and its shoddy 55% accuracy to confuse your opponent is an awful idea. No matter how much those Zubat in Mt. Moon might make you think otherwise, your opponent will still get to attack you over 70% of the time after you use this move. Stick to other status-inducing moves. There are better alternatives out there, even for confusion.</p>
