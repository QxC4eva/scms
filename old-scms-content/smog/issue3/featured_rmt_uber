<p>Hello everyone, this is the Ubers RMT that Twist Of Fate and I have decided would be the best choice for us to chronicle this issue. This team has influence the Uber tier as a whole and is an excellent team as a whole. Without any further wait, here is RISING FROM THE STORMS, an Ubers RMT by <a href="/forums/member.php?1779"><em>Jibaku</em></a></p>
 
 
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%; padding: 10px;">
<p>Hi. It's been a couple of months since my last Uber team, so I figured it's time to create another one.</p>
 
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>Despite me alternating between OU and Ubers in team posting, I am still very much an Ubers fan. I love the metagame more than the other metagames. This team I'm using is a variant of stall, being slightly more offensively geared to take advantage of the entry hazards put up during the slow-mo part in the early game. I don't believe anyone has used this team before-at least not the exact same content. But anyways, this team peaked me at #5 (probably could've gone for more but I stopped once I reached #5). And later on, I managed to shoot up from nothing to #6 on a different account using this team. In other words, this has been my most successful team.</p>
 
<p>Bragging aside, like my OU team, this team contains a star- Giratina-O. Like Theorymon, I've been unable to make a team without a specific Pokemon. While Theorymon can't make a Wobbuffettless team, my teams generally gear towards this Pokemon, if I'm not using normal Giratina of course. Now as the metagame progresses, the team slowly gets outdated, with the rise in Payback Forretresses and higher usage of Giratina-O to go alongside a Deoxys-S leads. The team still nets me an average of 6:1 win-loss ratio, though.</p>
 
<h3>Playstyle:</h3>
<p>To achieve the most success with this team, risky decisions usually produce the best results. If you've locked your opponent into a disadvantage, predict their switch in and keep them at a disadvantage. While it may sound obvious to all of you, it is only utilized by few players on ladder, and on a team that wants to set up entry hazards ASAP this tactic becomes almost a necessity to save time and secure chances of winning. This is what the team is built upon: an offensive mindset with defensive members, and as contradictory as that sounds, it allows matches to end quicker while retaining the defensive core of stall. Just because it's stall doesn't mean you cut down on the predictions just because you think you have stuff to cushion the blow.</p>

<p>Note: The EV spreads I post in here may not be the EV spreads I use. I will not tell you which ones I lied in. There are some extremely subtle hints though.</p>
 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/383.png" alt="Groudon" />
<pre>Groudon @ Leftovers
Ability: Drought
EVs: 252 HP/ 28 Atk / 196 Def / 32 Spd
Impish nature (+Def, -SAtk)
- Earthquake
- Dragon Claw
- Stealth Rock
- Roar</pre></div>
 
<p>The new Groudon&mdash;I'm fairly sure I was the first person to use Impish Groudon. But anyways, this thing sets up Stealth Rock, and beats up Dialga leads as well as outrunning twash's Groudon by one point. Choosing between Lum Berry and Leftovers bugged me a lot; Lum berry helps me get that Stealth Rock against Darkrai, but Leftovers help against Bulk Up Dialga and surviving a Lucario assault after SR + Spikes. This leads because I don't have a better lead, except maybe Forretress but I'd rather keep some kind of edge against Kyogre with the sunlight and all.</p> 
 
<p>Earthquake is for the obvious STAB and the ability to break down Dialga, while Dragon Claw helps a lot against Rayquaza, Lati@s, and Giratina-O. SR is obvious enough and Roar is something I've been testing recently, and it works with the entry hazards flying around. Bulk Up was in Roar's slot because it helps against RP Groudons and endgame BU Dialgas, so I might actually go back to that.</p>
 
<p>Groudon also provides weather control-which can either be good or horrible. Often times, Groudon finds itself switching into Thunders or some physical attack to remove the rain which can plague my team is thoroughly abused. This trait allows Groudon to be an incredible suicide bait, potentially changing the game's momentum upon its last breath.</p>
 
<p>The EV spread is simple for the most part. It survives 2 CB Outrages from Jolly Rayquaza-perhaps the strongest you'll ever see. Extras are dumped into Attack and Speed for extra oomph.</p>
 
<p>I suppose this is all I can say for Groudon. I'll let you all in a little trick though: Against Kyogre leads, I like to switch to Blissey to absorb their attack, then move right back to Groudon. This usually catches their physical attacker-often Scizor, off guard and nets me the Stealth Rock I need. It works 99% of the time, because no right minded person would keep a Scarf/Specs Ogre against Blissey while it's Sunny.</p>
 
 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/504.png" alt="Giratina-O" />
<pre>Giratina-o @ Griseous Orb
Ability: Levitate
EVs: 86 HP/116 Spd/216 SAtk/92 SDef
Modest nature (+SAtk, -Atk)
- Calm Mind
- Dragon Pulse
- Substitute
- Thunder</pre></div>
 
<p>I suppose it's not fitting to put the star of the team in the second slot, but I don't feel like shifting the order around. Whatever, I guess.</p>
 
<p>People are finally starting to realize the utility that Giratina-O has. Great news, great news¡Kbut for those of you still questioning its viability, and find Theorymon's 16 pages worth of Giratina-O analysis too long to read, let me list what this Pokemon can do.</p>
 
<p>First and foremost: Giratina-O is perhaps the best offensive spin blocker in the game. Unlike its cousin, this thing can threaten a quick sweep if not stopped promptly. With Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, and Spikes to go along this, the opponent struggles to switch around, knowing that 25%+ of their health can potentially be stripped. Giratina-O has the bonus of resisting Forretress's only weakness, while Forretress resists all four of Giratina-O's weaknesses. This is THE reason behind Payback Forretress, really. Payback Forry's a pain but Giratina-O can at least severely dent it to disuse (or kill it if it's raining with Thunder). That means for Giratina-O's life, the entry hazards shall remain on the field. If they don't have a Ghost, well sucks for them because I get to spin all of theirs away.</p>
 
<p>Secondly: Ghost, Levitate, Substitute, Calm Mind, and loads of power to boot- Giratina-O is a pretty good stall breaker, plowing through Blissey like cake. Again, THE reason some people actually go for CMBliss, which I have covered ƒº. CMed Dragon Pulse annihilates Latias at the price of its own life. But getting rid of Latias makes Kyogre's life so much easier, so its death is not in vain. I'm pretty sure no one else in stall would love swapping into this. Levitate means no Toxic Spikes/Spikes damage., and with the increase of stall or Deoxys-S, this ability is invaluable. Switching into a Groudon's Earthquake doesn't hurt either.</p>
 
<p>It has immunity to Trick, and can set up to take advantage of it.</p>
 
<p>Anyways the next thing up is that you may ask why I went for Thunder on the last slot. It was originally Shadow Ball, and SBall has been working great for me. However, my numerous encounters with twash on ladder pinpointed by Cro-Ogre weak (CM/Rest/Surf/Sleep Talk), so I reluctantly switched to Thunder, and it worked very nicely for me. Thunder also allows Giratina-O to beat up Forretress, as the numbers of Forries using Payback are increasing. A CMed Thunder should severely dent Forry, and from there I can throw a Dragon Pulse for safety's sake.</p>
 
<p>Oddly I've been considering something I thought I'd never will: using Timid Giratina-O. At the price of not getting past Latias, Giratina-O revenges Adamant Swords Dance Rayquaza and a weakened Lucario-preferably after they used Close Combat so that Dragon Pulse does >70% to it (or OHKO with Thunder in rain). No I am not swapping to Aura Sphere if I go for Timid. Losing bulk kinda tips me off though-I like surviving Spacial Rends and OHKOing Palkia afterwards, hopefully opening a Kyogre sweep. Or maybe I CAN still put bulk on at the price of some power, due to the entry hazards around. Hmm¡K</p>
 
 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/205.png" alt="Forretress" />
<pre>Forretress (M) @ Leftovers
Ability: Sturdy
EVs: 252 HP/4 Atk/252 SDef
Careful nature (+SDef, -SAtk)
- Spikes
- Rapid Spin
- Payback
- Toxic Spikes</pre></div>
 
<p>Forretress is the team's landmine-it sets up entry hazards surprisingly easily due to its numerous resistances-particularly Dragon and Ice, while Spinning away Deoxys-S leads' entry hazards. Forretress plays a central role in Uber stall and is perhaps the only reason people use Fire Punch/HP Fire Deoxys-S leads. Forretress resists every single of Giratina-O's weaknesses and thus often finds free switch ins.</p>
 
<p>Anyways, the premise is simple. Predict an Outrage, bring it in, and get a layer. Predict Blissey, and get a layer. Toxic Spikes is notable here as it destroys CMBliss pretty badly, as well as severely limiting Wobbuffet's lasting power. Payback is simple: Smack Giratina-O and hope it doesn't have Thunder or the odd HP Fire. It feels great to smack Gira-O on the switch though.</p> 
 
<p>Forry provides the team with an essential Dragon resist. Although Forry can not do much back to the likes of Garchomp when they're stuck Outraging, it can build up entry hazards and when Forry dies, Groudon can take its place. That and they can't come back in forever due to entry hazards (SR in Rayquaza's case, TS+ Spikes in Chomp's case). Toxic immunity is extremely helpful as well. This little shell finds so many switch ins its ridiculous.</p>
 
<p>The EVs are geared towards Special Defense to take on Spacial Rends and Giratina-O's Dragon Pulses. Sometimes, being able to survive random Flamethrowers in the rain helps, while other times, not being 2HKOed by Latias's Thunder can save the day.</p>
 
 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/489.png" alt="Palkia" />
<pre>Palkia @ Choice Scarf
Ability: Pressure
EVs: 136 Atk/252 Spd/120 SAtk
Hasty nature (+Spd, -Def)
- Flamethrower
- Outrage
- Spacial Rend
- Thunder</pre></div>
 
<p>This is the glue.</p>
 
<p>You don't see Scarf Palkia on stall teams all that often. But unlike other stall mine is more offensively minded. Palkia just fits in as the checker of things.</p>
 
<p>Anyways early in the game this serves to absorb Water Spouts from Kyogre, and later on Blissey can take that role. It stops DDRay from plowing through my team, and revenges Darkrai too. But I'm sure you're all aware what Scarfkia does. I personally don't like Scarf Palkia myself, but it fits!</p>
 
<p>The moveset is a slight alteration of the standard set: Spacial Rend and Thunder are practically staples. Unfortunately Spacial Rend just loves to miss at the worst times so I'm sort of considering Dragon Pulse over it. Call me crazy but it really does miss at the worst times. Flamethrower is chosen over Fire Blast for accuracy stuff, mainly due to Spacial Rend missing with 95% accuracy so I can't imagine how much more will Fire Blast miss¡Kbut I suppose I'll change this to Fire Blast if the extra power becomes suddenly needed. This was originally Surf, but it helps to works in both ends of the weather.</p>
 
<p>Finally, there's Outrage. Y'all might be confused as to why I put Outrage in there instead of another move like Surf. Outrage is indeed quite unexpected and helps beat up Lati@s and weakened CM Ogre. With Refresh, the former is especially hard to beat, so Palkia can come in the first time they're in and Outrage. This act often catches them off guard and nets me a free kill. However, if they catch on, I can always use Forretress the next time they come back in (as they probably would get a lot of CMs on the first switch in anyways). Outrage also provides me with a reliable attack to pick off scraps because of Spacial Miss. Outrage spam has won me a game before-in a 4-1 situation.</p>
 
 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/242.png" alt="Blissey" />
<pre>Blissey (F) @ Leftovers
Ability: Natural Cure
EVs: 252 Def/6 Spd/252 SDef
Calm nature (+SDef, -Atk)
- Toxic
- Seismic Toss
- Wish
- Protect</pre></div>
 
<p>As much as I hate using WishBliss due to it being nearly impossible to get in the cartridges (especially with good IVs and nature), Shoddy Battle has it there, and might as well use it.</p>
 
<p>On a team that makes a lot of switches, Blissey is practically necessary to sponge hits from the likes of Choice Specs Dialga and Scarf Palkia. Blissey passes Wishes around, especially to Giratina-O, who lacks a form of recovery and would very much appreciate this. Seismic Toss for reliable damage against Mewtwo and Darkrai, while Toxic is almost mandatory so I can get rid of Lati@s.</p>
 
<p>I am considering of changing this set to SToss/Toxic/Ice Beam/Softboiled, simply because without Ice Beam I can not touch Ghosts and Rayquaza/Garchomp suddenly loves me (though the latter probably eats a Toxic Spikes). Ice Beam also does something to Giratina-O, even if it's only 22%. But meh, I'm sticking with Wishbliss at the moment.</p>
 
<p>Well yeah this is Blissey what more can you expect me to say?</p>
 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/382.png" alt="Kyogre" />
<pre>Kyogre @ Leftovers
Ability: Drizzle
EVs: 252 HP/184 Def/72 Spd
Bold nature (+Def, -Atk)
- Surf
- Ice Beam
- Calm Mind
- Rest</pre></div>
 
<p>This is the late game sweeper, and don't tell me Rest sucks without Sleep Talk. It may seem so against offense, but it aids very strongly against stall and Lugia. With Toxic Spikes around, restoring health and status becomes crucial.</p>
 
<p>Kyogre is the second weather inducer, blocking sunny day abuse. Combined with Groudon, the two creates a powerful fort that cuts down on practically ANY weather abuse. So no more Ho-oh, Heatran, and Shiftry (even though Kyogre eats a Grass Knot) plowing through my team. Out of all the sets possible, I decided to go for the Calm Minder because it seems to cause a lot of pain in today's metagame, as Palkia can not stop it easily. Scarf Palkia is especially harassed as it is forced to use Thunder to even have a shot to break through this, and they usually don't spam Thunders because Groudon is present. That combined with Spikes, Stealth Rock, and poison damage from Toxic Spikes will end Palkia's life quickly while Kyogre could be yawning at Palkia's attempts to eliminate it. Kyogre is extremely tough to kill due to its typing and 140 base Special Defense.</p>
 
<p>So you may ask, why Ice Beam instead of Sleep Talk? I chose Ice Beam for Rayquaza, Garchomp and most importantly, Calm Mind Giratina. Doing extra damage to Palkia and Lati@s never hurts either. Also you may ask why the nature and EV spread&mdash;I tried to make Kyogre extremely bulky to survive a Swords Danced Dragon Claw from Rayquaza, as well as a Swords Danced Earthquake from non Life Orb Groudon, while the speed is there to outrun Lati@s and Gengar after it is Tricked a Choice Scarf.</p> 
 
<p>Because Payback Forretress cannot beat Rest/Talk Giratina-O, this is where Kyogre steps in to save the day.</p>
 
<p>I'm considering changing this back to Modest so I can OHKO Darkrai with Surf.</p></div>
 
<p>Uber Stall was long thought to be impossible, and if not impossible, very difficult to use. The Uber metagame is where all of the strongest Pokemon reside, and it's uncommon for any attackers to have their primary attacking stat under base 140. In this Rate My Team Jibaku proves that Uber Stall is completely viable and shares the success he had with it, getting as high as 5th on the Uber Ladder. Another reason that The Smog has decided to analyze this team is that it rapidly popularized Payback Forretress (in and out of the Uber metagame), which was almost nonexistent before Jibaku posted his team. Payback is now the primary option for Forretress in Ubers, as showcased by the July 2009 statistics, where over 50% of Forretress carry Payback.</p>
 
<p>Jibaku chooses to lead with Groudon, a solid choice to allow him to get down Stealth Rock early in the game. Roar allows Jibaku to pseudo-Haze your opponent's Pokemon early in the game to see what he/her is carrying as well as building up residual damage. Heavy defensive EV investment allows Jibaku's Groudon to take repeated assaults from the likes of Choice Band Scizor and Tyranitar and also easily scout Choice Scarf Garchomp. The ever so common Deoxys-E lead is stopped by Jibaku's Forretress as it can just Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock and Spikes or hit Giratina-O for a 3HKO, who is arguably the most common Rapid Spin blocker for an offensive team. Drought is important for Jibaku as it allows him to weaken the assaults of special attacking Water-types like Kyogre and Manaphy, which Blissey will often have trouble walling.</p>
 
<p>Blissey is Jibaku's primary special sponge, and an excellent one at that. Blissey can Wish pass to Groudon, Giratina-O, Forretress, and Palkia which is crucial to helping his team survive. Blissey can also scout choice locked users to Protect and can get his Pokemon in more safely because of that. Blissey is the counter to Choice Scarf Palkia, Choice Specs Dialga, Choice Scarf Kyogre, and in some situations even Choice Specs Kyogre. Without Blissey this team would not function anywhere near it's maximum potential, because even in Ubers, there is nothing that fulfills the special wall job better than Blissey. Blissey's only weakness is Fighting, which Giratina-O has an immunity to and it allows it to often get a free Calm Mind or two.</p>
 
<p>Some people may look at this team and immediately notice that Palkia is out of place. This is true, Palkia does seem out of place, but it does serve an important purpose. Palkia gives Jibaku a bit of offense, allowing him to revenge kill Dragon Dance Rayquaza as opposed to having to use his Groudon stop it. It also gives Jibaku a more offensive Water Spout absorber. Outrage allows for a makeshift way to beat Calm Mind Refresh Latias and weakened Calm Mind Kyogre and is also a solid 2HKO on most Blissey, which is good because Calm Mind Blissey can be a pain to Jibaku should he lose his own Blissey. Spacial Rend gives a solid move to clean up with as well as a nice critical hit ratio to go along with it. Thunder hits Kyogre and Manaphy for a nice 2HKO if they become too troublesome. Palkia will also be relied on to revenge kill Giratina-O if Forretress dies, as Forretress is one of few pokemon that can kill Giratina-O on Jibaku's team barring Kyogre after it has Calm Minded or his own Giratina-O.</p>
 
<p>Giratina-O is an excellent spin blocker as well as a solid counter to ResTalk Calm Mind Kyogre, something that Jibaku's team cannot hit hard enough after a Calm Mind. Giratina-O plays another important role besides spin blocking. Giratina-o is Jibaku's Trick receiver. Thanks to Griseous Orb having to remain on Giratina-O at all times, Trick will fail and Giratina-O will get a free Substitute or Calm Mind. Giratina-O is an excellent sweeper with Toxic Spikes down because they let Giratina outstall Blissey. Giratina-O was chosen over Giratina for a more offensive spin blocker and also because Giratina-O provides the aforementioned Trick immunity. Levitate provides Jibaku with a Ground immunity as well, which another thing that Giratina does not provide for him. Levitate also gives immunity to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes which is very crucial against other stall teams.</p>
 
<p>Kyogre is Jibaku's second weather changer, providing permanent rain every time it enters the battlefield. Dual weather allows Jibaku to control Rain Dance / Sunny Day abuse teams which would otherwise give him trouble, as he mentions in the team above. While it may seem very strange to run Calm Mind Kyogre with Rest but no Sleep Talk or cleric, Jibaku makes it work. Kyogre absolutely needs Ice Beam to allows Jibaku to hit Garchomp and Rayquaza and Giratina (both normal and Giratina-O), and Rest is needed to keep Kyogre alive as it plays a crucial role in the team's success. Calm Mind boosts Kyogre's already excellent 140 Base Special Defense and forces physical attackers to come in to beat it. Kyogre is the only counter to Ho-oh, but it is a very solid one at that and can take repeated assaults from Ho-oh and Rest off damage when needed.</p>
 
<p>While this is an excellent team, it goes without saying that every team has weaknesses. A well played Wobbuffet can trap Blissey, Forretress, and Palkia and make them useless or KO them, and all of them are needed for Jibaku to have a good shot at winning. Without Blissey Jibaku's team falls to repeated special assaults from the likes of Choice Specs Dialga. Without Palkia, Jibaku cannot break Refresh Calm Mind Latias and without Forretress Jibaku cannot set up entry hazards that his team revolves around. Repeated physical assaults gradually wear Jibaku down, especially combinations like Swords Dance Rayquaza and Swords Dance Lucario on the same team.</p>
 
<p>Overall, this team is an excellent example of how stall should be played in Ubers and silences all users that thought Uber Stall to be impossible.</p>
