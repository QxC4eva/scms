[SHORT DESC]
Prevents opponents from healing for 5 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prevents the target from healing itself for five turns. During this time, instant-recovery moves (eg. Recover) and passive healing moves (eg. Ingrain) may not be used. Leftovers will not restore HP. Draining moves (eg. Giga Drain) will cause damage but will not heal the user. Pokemon with the ability Volt Absorb or Water Absorb will take damage from Electric- and Water-type attacks, respectively, and will not be healed. Pokemon with the ability Poison Heal will neither lose nor gain HP while under Heal Block. Pokemon with the ability Ice Body or Rain Dish will heal under their respective weathers. If an affected Pokemon uses Baton Pass, the replacement will remain unable to restore its HP. Pain Split and the ability Regenerator are unaffected. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. In-game, Heal Block does not prevent you from healing your Pokemon using Berries or Potions, or any other such items.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Heal Block is an ineffective tactic since the opponent can simply switch out. Furthermore, unlike Taunt, Heal Block does not stop other non-damaging moves. Lastly, many Pokemon do not have room for this move.</p>
