</ul>

<p>Contrary does not alter the effects of <a href="/bw/moves/haze">Haze</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/heart_swap">Heart Swap</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/guard_swap">Guard Swap</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/power_swap">Power Swap</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/spinda">Spinda</a> receives both Contrary and Superpower from the Dream World. This combination allows Spinda to boost its very poor Attack and Defense stats in one shot. Unfortunately, Spinda is so slow and still specially frail that many special attackers who resist or are immune to Superpower can switch in and KO it with a strong special attack.</p>
