-Mime Jr can pass Barrier / Calm Mind / Nasty Plot
-Mienfoo can set up Substitute and passes Swords Dance / Bulk Up

Other Options
########

-Can use a gimicky LO NP set while Sticky Web is out, but it is outclassed by Swirlix as a sweeper
-Can utilize a Wishpass set, but is outclassed my Spritzee because poor HP, and no Aroma Veil
-New recovery in Morning Sun (but has access to Soft-Boiled from gen 3 iirc and there are move illegalities so what's the point)
-Semi Annoyer set with Thunder Wave / Encore but is slow and cant take repeated hits
-Can utilize Body Slam / Headbutt or Zen Headbutt for flinch hax under Sticky Web




Checks & Counters (wip since new set)
########

**Phazing** This will cancel all boosts you've gained so far.
**Steel Typing** Walls this set since there are no super effective moves you can use to beat them. Bronzor can take this set all day. You'd need a 580 Base Stored Power in order to OHKO.
