Puts the target to sleep.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Puts the target to sleep. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Pokemon with the abilities Insomnia or Vital Spirit are immune. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>GrassWhistle is unreliable due to poor distribution and accuracy. Most prominent users also have access to the much more reliable Sleep Powder, anyways. All things considered it's clear that GrassWhistle is completely outclassed.</p>
