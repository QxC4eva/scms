<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The move's type depends on the user's held item. If the user is holding a Plate item, then the move's type changes to the corresponding type. If it is not holding a Plate, the move is Normal-type.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Oh boy. This is Arceus's exclusive attack, and it's a 100% accuracy move that will change type depending on the held Plate. Since Arceus will always need to carry a Plate to change type itself, this is essentially always a STAB move which also happens to be boosted by the Plate as well, so that Arceus always has a very powerful special STAB move no matter what type it is. For this reason, it is the STAB option of choice on almost all of Arceus's Calm Mind sets.</p>

<h2>Related Moves</h2>
<p>There are no moves similar to Judgment, though this more depends on the type of Judgment being used. For example, Water-type Judgment is highly similar to <a href="/bw/moves/surf">Surf</a>, but sports more power, as well as <a href="/bw/moves/flamethrower">Flamethrower</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/thunderbolt">Thunderbolt</a>, and the like.</p>
