      <p>An incredibly unreasonable hour of the early morning, I had rolled up in front of the communications center at 2:31 AM. Stepping out of my car and swiftly entering the building, I was greeted with an empty, quiet lobby. It was mostly dark, with just one dimly lit hallway on the far end of the room. At the end of the hallway, a brighter white light cast its radiance from a larger room into the otherwise nearly pitch black hall. In the room was an office with several small workplaces, each littered with pens, important documents, and sticky notes with phone numbers scribbled on them.</p>
   
      <p>As I rounded the corner of a shamefully trashy cubicle, I came upon a peculiar sight, given the surroundings: an immaculate desk with not a stray paper, pencil, or telephone cord in sight. Behind the desk seated a woman who was in the process of setting down a mug of coffee. "Fuel for the untimely interview appointment, I guess..." I thought to myself as I sat down in a surprisingly comfortable leather chair.</p>

  <div class="interview-speaker antemortem"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_antemortem.png" alt="antemortem" /><div><p>Evening - er, morning? - Briyella! First, I'll start with something that's been on my mind for some time: where exactly does your username, Goddess Briyella, come from?</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_briyella.png" alt="Goddess Briyella" /><div><p>Briyella is my actual name. About 2 years ago when I found Showdown, I just put random titles in front of it like trainers have, such as Youngster Joey. At the time (when Lobby was the only room), Voice was being given out for users who achieved a certain ladder rank after 100 battles, and they held the channel for different tiers. I was just getting into LC when they held a Voice challenge for that, and, of the many usernames I used while going for that rank, Goddess Briyella is the one that I managed to get Voice with, and I just never changed it. My first username here was actually Queen Bri, which some users mistook as a Princess Bri (now known as Dice) alt or a user attempting to troll him, but it was just a huge coincidence; I was new and had never heard of him before.</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker antemortem"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_antemortem.png" alt="antemortem" /><div><p>Oh, it's interesting that the name you've come so far with was basically a luck of the draw! Speaking of Little Cup, you're a big proponent and player of the metagame, aren't you?</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_briyella.png" alt="Goddess Briyella" /><div><p>I don't show my face in LC tournaments very often, but as far as contributions, analyses, mentoring new users, and just generally keeping up with the tier, I'm pretty involved, yes. blarajan and Ray Jay pretty much programmed me, haha.</p></div></div>

  <div class="aside"><div><p>I had to resist the urge to check underneath the desk and behind her chair for any connected power cords...</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker antemortem"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_antemortem.png" alt="antemortem" /><div><p>Your contributions are definitely prominent, what with being a regular in the LC room as well as the section on the forum and C&amp;C. Now that you mention it, how come you don't participate in LC tournaments very often?</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_briyella.png" alt="Goddess Briyella" /><div><p>Tournaments just aren't my thing, at least not at this time. I have a tendency to get insurmountably haxed out of important battles (almost anyone in the LC community could tell you that), and it became annoying for me, so I'd rather spend my efforts helping out others and keeping things for the tier in line than participate in tournaments, because I can't be haxed out of doing that and everyone wins there. I like to think I'm a pretty good player, though, and I was a lot more active as a battler last year; I made second place for Best LC Battler in the 2013 Smog Awards behind blarajan. But yeah, I just value contribution higher than battling.</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker antemortem"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_antemortem.png" alt="antemortem" /><div><p>Not sure I've ever thought about it like that before. We might could all learn something from lines of thought like that. I hear you've got quite a few people that you regularly mentor, so obviously teaching is something you love to do, am I right?</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_briyella.png" alt="Goddess Briyella" /><div><p>Absolutely. There's no use in keeping knowledge and insight to yourself, especially if you're someone like me who doesn't battle much. I'm a LC tutor and am also pretty big in the Smogon Mentorship Program, where I take on lots of mentees that are interested in becoming involved in Little Cup, Pok&eacute;mon Showdown, The Smog, and/or C&amp;C, which includes GP. I'm most interested in mentoring troubled users and helping them find an outlet in something they're good at. A sizable number of users have been badged as a result of my guidance, and I hope to keep that going.</p></div></div>

  <div class="aside"><div><p>At this point, her eyes were glinting with pride, or maybe her pupils were just extremely dilated from all the coffee she had to force down to stay awake.</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker antemortem"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_antemortem.png" alt="antemortem" /><div><p>Passing along your knowledge of LC seems a productive thing to do if you don't battle too often. Much admiration. So, does your interest in teaching others come from real life? If not, what do you do?</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_briyella.png" alt="Goddess Briyella" /><div><p>My job actually has nothing to do with teaching. I'm a supervisor at a COMM center for 911 and police, where I mostly just sit in front of a computer for 12 hours with a headset on. Naturally, I have Smogon, PS, and IRC in front of me right there while nothing is going on at the office.</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker antemortem"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_antemortem.png" alt="antemortem" /><div><p>That's really cool! You seem a natural leader, so you being a supervisor isn't all that surprising. When you're not at work, what do you like to do in your downtime besides PS?</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_briyella.png" alt="Goddess Briyella" /><div><p>Thank you. I don't really have a life, haha. Most of my free time goes to Smogon, Pok&eacute;mon Showdown, and mentoring people for different areas in both places. I sometimes record music at home with my roommate Lovesage (I play piano and guitar, she plays the cello), and I play video games when I have the time. Pok&eacute;mon and Zelda games are my favorites.</p></div></div>

  <div class="aside"><div><p>I smirked, my eyes shifting to the closed 3DS next to her computer. She was probably keeping it out of sight so nobody would notice, but I'm more than positive she plays A Link Between Worlds during her breaks.</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker antemortem"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_antemortem.png" alt="antemortem" /><div><p>That's all cool and respectable all the same, especially when in the company of fellow video game nerds. So you mentioned earlier you joined Smogon around 2 years ago; what originally brought you here?</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_briyella.png" alt="Goddess Briyella" /><div><p>I have lurked on Smogon for movesets and things since the DPP era, so I had a general idea of how things worked, but I never made an account and honestly never had the intention of making one. It wasn't until well after I found PS that I was convinced to make a Smogon account. Electrolyte, a moderator here, got me to sign up after I got Voice through the LC Voice challenge. I lurked some more and didn't really become active on Smogon until the beginning of XY; that's when I began contributing and I had help from blarajan and a few others. I actually started spending more effort on Smogon than PS after I got Driver on PS. I needed an outlet and I think contributing to Smogon was just more fulfilling for me at the time.</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker antemortem"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_antemortem.png" alt="antemortem" /><div><p>I got you. You just needed a push in that direction, huh? When trying to relax while on the PS server, what rooms do you find yourself chatting in most often, or which do you deem to be your favorite(s)?</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_briyella.png" alt="Goddess Briyella" />
	<div>
      <p>I like to be an active presence in the Lobby if I'm not doing much, or I at least like to be in the room so that users can find me if there's a problem. However, my favorite room on the server has to be Roleplaying. I don't care if people think that room is just a bunch of kids that like to pretend. Every single user there is nice and well-behaved, and I always enjoy my interactions with the userbase there. Skitty and the other Owners do a damn good job of maintaining the room. The Roleplaying staff also has a lot of my favorite people in it, and I've recently joined their staff as well. The whole room is just awesome.</p>
   
      <p>Other than that, Art and Game Corner are probably my favorite rooms. I get to interact with a lot of contributors I work with on Smogon in the Art room, and I also get to have a firsthand look at new drawing talent. Game Corner is another fun place where everyone gets along, and hanging out with Astara and Quinella there is always nice.</p>

  <div class="interview-speaker antemortem"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_antemortem.png" alt="antemortem" /><div><p>On the Smogon side of things, I know you're very busy, so what areas of the site are you involved in?</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_briyella.png" alt="Goddess Briyella" />
	<div>
      <p>I've been pretty involved in Little Cup C&amp;C since right before Ray Jay went inactive. After I got the Contributor badge for my analysis work and mods of the forum, however, I kind of took a back seat to let others contribute more. I felt like I was hogging a lot of the work early on, anyway, and I wanted to give others a chance. Of course, I still do my part to make sure our analyses and Quality Control are up to par, and I've been keeping things organized there; I update things and make reminder posts if I notice recurring mistakes every so often.</p>

      <p>I'm very involved in The Smog, originally just for representing Little Cup, but I've since branched out to write about other things as well. I also got into the GP team to appease my OCD, and I'm glad to be able to help correct errors in analyses and articles before they go onsite. The perfectionist in me is the driving force behind that work, even though it may seem like a tedious hobby to others. Seeing unneeded errors annoys me to death, lol.</p>

  <div class="aside"><div><p>I can't help but remember her "programmed" comment, and this time actually sneak a peak under the desk after pretending to drop my pen... Nothing there. Shoot.</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker antemortem"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_antemortem.png" alt="antemortem" /><div><p>Since you're active on Smogon and PS, which are, at their core, Pok&eacute;mon fansites, you must be an avid Pok&eacute;mon fan. What happen to be your favorite games and Pok&eacute;mon, if you could pick one of each?</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_briyella.png" alt="Goddess Briyella" /><div><p>Hmm. My favorite Pok&eacute;mon was always Eevee. I loved that thing and it was the cutest thing ever, until DPP came out and I saw Vespiquen, which I fell in love with. She's so gorgeous. ^_^ Also, my favorite Pok&eacute;mon game of all is probably Yellow. It's the first game I ever had and there's so much nostalgic significance there. Also, the basslines in the old 8-bit music tracks from RBY are simply unparalleled and none of the newer games can capture that same intensity, no matter how many flashy sound effects or improved synthetic instruments they use.</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker antemortem"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_antemortem.png" alt="antemortem" /><div><p>Oh, definitely. Yellow is an absolute classic! Thanks very much for your time, Briyella.</p></div></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/player/issue4/interview_briyella.png" alt="Goddess Briyella" /><div><p>Certainly. Thanks for having me and listening to me ramble, haha. &hearts;</p></div></div>

  <div class="aside"><div><p>I stood and turned, taking one last glance behind her chair as she waved me off. No wires or anything, but she did give a satisfying interview, so I decided to leave her to her work and Legend of Zelda.</p></div></div>
