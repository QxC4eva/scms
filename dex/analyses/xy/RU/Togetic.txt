Overview
########

Togetic returns to XY RU with new toys, most notably a new Fairy typing, which gives it a 4x resistance to Fighting- and Bug-type moves, as well as a new resistance to Dark. In addition to this, it has access to wonderful support moves such as Defog and Heal Bell, as well as reliable recovery in Roost. Its defensive stats are quite good, and are boosted even further with Eviolite, and its vast movepool allows it to take on a few roles. However, Togetic has a low HP stat and suffers from being slow. It does not have a good Flying-type STAB move and faces stiff competition with Aromatisse as a Fairy-type and Gligar as a Defog user. Togetic's crippling weakness to Stealth Rock gives it a hard time using Defog efficiently, and it sadly cannot use its Dark- and Fighting-type resistances to the fullest extent. Togetic hates having its Eviolite Knocked Off, and most Fighting- and Dark-type Pokemon carry the move. In some cases, Fighting-types such as Cobalion and Virizion even carry Stone Edge, but nonetheless, Togetic can be very useful.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Seismic Toss / Dazzling Gleam
move 2: Roost
move 3: Defog / Encore
move 4: Heal Bell / Thunder Wave / Toxic
ability: Serene Grace
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 160 Def / 100 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Seismic Toss deals consistent damage, though Dazzling Gleam can be used instead as a decent STAB move on Togetic which allows it to OHKO Zoroark and Sharpedo after Stealth Rock. Roost allows Togetic to recover any damage it may have taken. The third move is a toss-up. Defog removes entry hazards from both sides of the battlefield, and makes Togetic an excellent team supporter, as it can use Defog quite effectively thanks to its bulk and typing. However, Encore prevents many setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Reuniclus and Cresselia from setting up and locks them into a boosting move. This allows Togetic to beat them one-on-one with Seismic Toss or Toxic. Baton Pass can be used with Encore, giving valuable momentum to your team. The fourth move is also a matter of preference. Heal Bell allows Togetic to cure status for its team, though Thunder Wave allows Togetic to further support its teammates by crippling opposing sweepers. Lastly, Toxic can be used as it puts a timer on dangerous sweepers and walls.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread with a Calm nature allows Togetic to avoid the 2HKO from Yanmega's Choice Specs Air Slash after Stealth Rock, the KO from Moltres's Life Orb Hurricane, as well as allowing it to take on Pokemon such as Zoroark and Hitmonlee better. However, a fully physical or specially defensive set can be used if you're having trouble with physical or special attackers, respectively. Eviolite is the only option that should be considered on Togetic, as it boosts its good defenses to higher levels.

Usage Tips
========

Switch into Pokemon that Togetic can easily wall, such as Hitmonlee, Yanmega, and Zoroark, and proceed to support your team by using Thunder Wave, Defog, Heal Bell, or Toxic. Try not to get Togetic's Eviolite Knocked Off, Eviolite is the only thing making Togetic decently bulky. If it is running Defog, use it warily if there is Defiant or Competitive user such as Braviary, as they can use it to their advantage.

Team Options
========

Steel-types such as Cobalion and Doublade can take on the Ice-, Steel-, and Poison-type moves aimed at Togetic, and in return, Togetic can switch into Ground-type moves directed at them. Alomomola is a great partner, having good type synergy with Togetic, as well as being able to pass huge Wishes to improve Togetic's longevity as well as benefitting from Heal Bell support that Togetic provides. It can also deal with the physical attackers that Togetic has trouble dealing with. Gastrodon is also a good partner, being able to take Poison-, Steel-, Electric-, and some Ice-type moves aimed at Togetic, and in return, Togetic can cure troubling status and switch into the Grass-type moves directed at Gastrodon. In addition, Pokemon who appreciate entry hazard removal such as Delphox make good partners with Togetic. Pokemon who appreciate status inflicted or cured make good partners. Sweepers such as Escavalier and Sharpedo really appreciate cleric support, as well as the utility Togetic can provide with Thunder Wave or Toxic. If Togetic is not running Defog, Rapid Spin users such as Hitmontop make good partners, and can remove Stealth Rock to allow Togetic to switch in more often. In addition, Hitmontop can switch into the Rock-type moves aimed at Togetic. Finally, setup sweepers such as Zoroark, Virizion, and Cobalion can take advantage of Togetic's Encore support as they can set up on the locked Pokemon.

Nasty Plot + Baton Pass
########
name: Nasty Plot + Baton Pass
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Flamethrower
move 4: Roost
ability: Serene Grace
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 240 Def / 20 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Nasty Plot is the most important move on this set, as it boosts Special Attack, and allows Togetic to use Baton Pass to give its teammates boosts, as well as allowing it to keep momentum. Flamethrower allows Togetic to get past problematic Steel-types that try to switch in. Roost allows Togetic to stay alive longer, and is reliable recovery.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread with a Bold nature allows Togetic to have an easier time passing Nasty Plots. The Special Attack EVs allow it to OHKO 172 HP Escavalier after Stealth Rock with a +2 Flamethrower. Eviolite should be the only item that should be used, as it boosts Togetic's decent defenses to higher levels.

Usage Tips
========

In some situations, it can use Baton Pass without any boosts to gain momentum. In addition, switch into Pokemon that can't really touch Togetic such as Hitmontop, and proceed to use Nasty Plot and Baton Pass. Lastly, use Roost often to keep Togetic alive. Note that if the opponent is faster, the recipient gets in for free most of the time.

Team Options
========

Fast special sweepers such as Delphox, Mismagius, and Jolteon can use the Nasty Plot boosts effectively and break through most Pokemon in the metagame. Speed Boost users such as Yanmega and specially based Sharpedo make excellent receivers of Nasty Plot as well, especially Yanmega, because +2 Special Attack with a few Speed boosts basically means it's game over for the opponent. Pokemon such as Virizion and Magneton, who have good type synergy with Togetic, can turn the tables if they receive the Nasty Plot boost, and can force many of Togetic's checks and counters out with powerful attacks. Dual screen users such as Bronzong and Cresselia can use the respective screens to make it basically make it impossible to stop Togekiss from passing Nasty Plot unless the opponent carries Roar or Whirlwind, boosting its respectable bulk to extreme levels, as well as cushioning the recipient of Nasty Plot.

Other Options
########

Wish can be used, but Togetic has a small HP stat, and Roost is more reliable. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Doublade and make them think twice before setting up. Tri Attack can also be used to abuse Serene Grace. Fire Blast can be used to roast Steel-types that try to switch into Togetic for super effective damage, hitting harder than Flamethrower at the cost of accuracy. Grass Knot can be used to hit dangerous Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Gastrodon for a lot of damage. Likewise, Ancient Power can be used to hit Moltres and Yanmega hard. Finally, Psych Up allows Togetic to copy stat boosts, but is very gimmicky.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Cobalion and Registeel don't really care about Thunder Wave and are immune to Toxic, and can force Togetic out with their STAB attacks or set up on it.

**Poison-types**: Poison-types such as Drapion and Skuntank can force Togetic with their strong STAB moves, and are immune to Toxic.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Jolteon, Magneton, and Rotom-C can force Togetic out with their strong STAB moves, and they can all keep momentum with Volt Switch, and have an immunity to paralysis. 

**Rhyperior**: Rhyperior threatens Togetic with Stone Edge, and has Roar to phaze Nasty Plot + Baton Pass sets.

**Taunt users**: Taunt users prevent Togetic from supporting its team, and render it setup fodder.

**Knock Off**: Knock Off removes Togetic's Eviolite and thus permanently hinders its ability to take hits.
