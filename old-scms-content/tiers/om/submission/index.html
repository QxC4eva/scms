<p>Users submitting Other Metagames is the whole foundation of the subforum and why we run; without user submitting metagames, we'd have no metagames running to keep us functioning! We thrive on users submitting and that's really where our heart is. However, some people may find it a bit intimidating submitting a metagame or may be out of ideas, this page will be about the process of submission. Submiting takes place in <a href="/forums/forums/om-submissions.289/">this</a> subform, <strong>strictly here alone</strong>. This is one of the most important rules of submission: only post in this subforum, <strong>never</strong> in the main subforum!</p>

<p>Before you post your submission, there are a few things to remember.</p>

<ol>
    <strong><li>Check to make sure the idea doesn't exsist.</li></strong><br />
    <p style="margin-left:-40px;">Before submission, before even writing the idea, it's very important to check if the metagame is already exsisting. Every metagame can be located in the index, which can be found <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/other-metagames-index-resources-found-here.3505031/">here</a>. In this index, there is the metagame, its link, and the description. A brief skim through it will easily tell you if your idea is already exsisting. Should you find that the idea hasn't been submitted yet, move on to the next step!</p>
    
    <strong><li>Think about the metagame.</li></strong><br />
    <p style="margin-left:-40px;">Metagames are best when they are fun. Making a metagame where all Pok&eacute;mon have to use Splash is not fun. Think about a unique idea, that doesn't change <em>too</em> much. The most successful metagames are the ones with one, simple, consice idea. Take STABmons as an example: it has one broad change that hugely impacts the way the format is played. Metagames that are fun, simple, and easy to learn are the metagames that get approved.</p>
    
    <strong><li>Format.</li></strong><br />
    <p style="margin-left:-40px;">Now that you have a brand new, fresh idea, it's time to post your submission! However, the idea behind the metagame is not always the most important part; most of the time, it's the format. Let's look at examples of a bad format:</p>
    
    <div class="box">hi guys! i am submitting metagame idea. this metagame idea is a metagame idea unlike any metagame idea uve ever seen!!!!! this metagame is where pokemon get access to stab moves of there type. this already exist lol but this is brand new; and new! this tear is called.... "stabbymons!" it's brand new and excitingns! pokemon are banned if their too strong XD. those pokemon are kyurem (so strong) and talonflame (lol ou!!!!) and also aegislash unbanned because why not :3! so yeah that's it XD!!!! pls approve!!!!!!!</div>
    
    <p style="margin-left:-40px;">Can you see the errors in this text? The punctuation is off, the capitalization, the spelling errors! And, most importantly, the idea already exsists! Now, let's look at a <em>good</em> example:</p>
    
    <div class="box"><div align="center"><strong>Wondermons</strong></div>
    <p>The idea behind this metagame is simple: everything gets Wonder Guard. Now, I know what you're thinking, "uh, wouldn't this be the most broken thing in the world?" and you may be right! However, the spice to this metagame is that everything also gets access to every single move. Even crazier! This balances things out because then Pok&eacute;mon are able to counter other Pok&eacute;mon through various means.</p></div>
    
    <p style="margin-left:-40px;">This is a properfly formatted post. It gets right to the idea and has proper grammar! Is this idea  viable one? Not really. But, they do get props for the presentation! Keep in mind that the post you make in Submissions should exactly reflect how it will look when you actually post it. Thus, some more length and perhaps an image will go a long way.</p>
    
    <strong><li>Time of submissions.</li></strong><br />
    <p style="margin-left:-40px;">The people who are able to view Submissions are Eevee General, The Immortal, Joim, Hollywood, and unfixable. We all have lifes, and we all do see your metagame. You have to keep in mind that not everything can get approved instantly, and thus we've put in place a week-long waiting period before bumping. A lot of metagames get submitted, and we just can't get to every single one immediately. So, always remember to be patient when submitting!</p>
</ol>

<p>Now that we've gone over the basics, get to submitting!</p>
