[Overview]

<p>There was once an episode in the anime where the main antagonist was a surprisingly dangerous Togepi. You can make an almost perfect analogy to the current NU metagame with that knowledge, with Cinccino as Togepi and the rest of the metagame as Ash and his gang. This is all because of the release of Skill Link, which has put Cinccino in an interesting position; with the proper coverage move, it can OHKO or 2HKO nearly any Pokemon in the entire tier. This is because Cinccino's main STAB move, as well as its main coverage moves, have an effective Base Power of 125 due to Skill Link, with the added benefit of breaking through Sturdy and Substitute. Combine this with a decent base 95 Attack and blazing Speed, and Cinccino becomes the cutest and arguably the most dangerous attacker in the entire metagame.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, cute and fluffy Pokemon inevitably have their downfalls. Cinccino has some of the lowest defensive stats in the tier, meaning that it's not too hard to take care of with strong priority moves or even just an attack from Pokemon that can take a hit. Additionally, sometimes Cinccino's power is a bit lacking due to its low Attack stat. All in all, however, these drawbacks are really easy to work around. In fact, if you don't find a stop to an opposing Cinccino as soon as possible, you will be in for a world of hurt.</p>

[SET]

move 2: Rock Blast

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Life Orb attached, Cinccino becomes one of the most threatening late-game cleaners in the entire tier, thanks to its superb coverage and ideal mix of Speed and power. Tail Slap is the Cinccino line's signature move, but it's being used because it actually is a fantastic move for Cinccino. Thanks to Skill Link, Tail Slap is Cinccino's most powerful STAB move, with the advantage of breaking through Substitutes and Sturdy. The main use for Rock Blast on this set is to eliminate Drifblim and Haunter, both of whom are immune to Cinccino's STAB move. Bullet Seed hits Rock-types that resist Tail Slap, such as Golem, Carracosta, and Regirock. In the final moveslot, U-turn is used to scout for the opponent's counters to Cinccino and deal with them accordingly. As an added plus, U-turn can wear down the opponent enough so that when your Pokemon actually attack them, they will be much easier to take out. One the other hand, Wake-Up Slap is useful for hitting Probopass and Bastiodon for super effective damage; however, it hits little else much harder than Cinccino's other coverage moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb is the preferred item on this set, since it provides Cincinno with enough power to clean up, while also retaining the ability to switch moves. Jolly is the preferred nature because Cincinno will outspeed almost every unboosted Pokemon in the tier with it. However, if you feel like the power boost from an Adamant nature is necessary, you may use that. However, keep in mind that with an Adamant nature Cincinno will only outspeed Pokemon with base 100 Speed and under.</p>

<p>Substitute is an option on this set in the final moveslot, since it gives Cincinno a lot more flexibility thanks to a buffer from at least one attack, as well as status moves. Opponents who rely on Sucker Punch to beat Cincinno, such as Absol, will also struggle if Cincinno is behind a Substitute. On that note, you might consider Leftovers if you are running Substitute so as to replenish Cincinno's HP for more Substitutes. However, this reduces Cinccino's power considerably, meaning that hazards become mandatory.</p>

<p>Cinccino really needs a lot of team support to function at its best. Hazard support is one of the best things you can provide to Cinccino, as a multitude of KOes are guaranteed with Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. For example, with said hazards, Cinccino always 2HKOes Alomomola and specially defensive Lickilicky with the respective coverage move. Rapid Spin support also works nicely with Cinccino, since damage from hazards, along with Life Orb recoil, can really shorten its lifespan. Armaldo is an excellent user of Rapid Spin, since it can weaken the enemy team with its Swords Dance set or lay down its own Stealth Rock. Poison-types are also an option to eliminate Toxic Spikes as soon as they enter the field. Skuntank is probably the best fit for the job when used in conjunction with Cinccino, since it removes Ghost-types as well, making Cinccino's job that much easier. Lastly, it must be noted that more than anything, Cinccino is a cleaner; it really struggles to get through some of the sturdier walls in the metagame. As such, wallbreakers are an excellent idea. Emboar, Absol, and Golurk all fit the bill, since they all have the tools necessary to break unprepared teams in two, paving the way for Cinccino to come in later and clear up what remains.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Tail Slap
move 2: Rock Blast
move 3: Bullet Seed
move 4: U-Turn / Wake-Up Slap
item: Choice Band
ability: Skill Link
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When holding a Choice Band, Cinccino can still function as a late-game cleaner, but it boasts enough power to become a good wallbreaker as well, as very few Pokemon can avoid a 2HKO from this set. Tail Slap hits ludicrously hard with a Choice Band and Skill Link boost, as it 2HKOes every Pokemon in the tier that does not resist it. Rock Blast takes care of the Ghost-types that are immune to Tail Slap, OHKOing all of them except for Misdreavus. Bullet Seed hits Rock-types who resist Tail Slap, such as Golem and Regirock. Bullet Seed always 2HKOes standard Regirock after Stealth Rock damage, which means that Cinccino can take out every Rock-type in the NU metagame with Choice Band Bullet Seed. U-Turn is a great move to gain momentum against the opponent, allowing you to both get out of sticky situations and do decent damage after a Choice Band boost. Wake-Up Slap is a decent option to hit Steel-types, as it hits the major Steel-types of NU for a certain OHKO.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band is what separates this set from others; with it, Cinccino boasts a surprising amount of power. A Jolly nature might not boost Cinccino's Attack further like an Adamant nature would, but the ability to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame is much more important for Cinccino, and an Adamant nature is almost irrelevant because of the boost provided by Choice Band. As this set can function as a wallbreaker as well as a cleaner, other wallbreakers are appreciated as teammates. Emboar is a great example, as it can easily plow through the Steel-types which can tank Cinccino's hits with ease. On that note, Pokemon that can make use of the holes Cinccino makes in opposing teams are good ideas as well. Toxic Boost Zangoose is an interesting partner, as it can also take care of the Steel-types that Cinccino struggles with, even with a Choice Band equipped. Lastly, hazard support is greatly appreciated. Stealth Rock is a good idea, and a lot of Pokemon who can utilize it fit well on offensive teams, where Cinccino tends to reside. Golem is an excellent example of this, providing Stealth Rock while also boasting a massive offensive presence. Spikes is another entry hazard that Cinccino can take advantage of, thanks to switches it may cause. Garbodor is probably the best choice out there, since not only can it lay Spikes, but it also has decent synergy with Cinccino, since it can take Fighting-type attacks with ease.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Tail Slap
move 2: Rock Blast
move 3: Bullet Seed
move 4: U-Turn / Wake-Up Slap
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Skill Link
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although a Choice Scarf might seem like overkill on something as insanely fast as Cinccino, it actually serves a very unique purpose: to revenge kill almost all common weather abusers, as well as other Choice Scarf users. For example, this set outspeeds neutral Victreebel in the sun as well as all Choice Scarf users at or below base 100 Speed. Tail Slap is Cinccino's STAB move of choice, as with an Adamant nature it takes out almost all weather abusers and Choice Scarf users in one hit. Rock Blast takes care of Ghost-types such as Choice Scarf Haunter, as well as Drifblim before an Unburden boost. Bullet Seed's main use is to revenge abusers of Swift Swim, such as Gorebyss. It also has utility against the everpresent Rock-types, such as Golem and Relicanth. U-Turn is a great option to keep momentum going and OHKOes uninvested Exeggutor after Stealth Rock damage, but Wake-Up Slap also works, as you can dent Steel-types such as Probopass and Bastiodon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice Scarf attached, Cinccino outspeeds almost everything under the stars, which is what makes this set tick. Adamant is the preferred nature, as there are almost no repercussions when you use it. The power boost from an Adamant nature is also welcomed. A Jolly nature may also be used, but there is almost nothing that you don't outspeed with Adamant already. Entry hazards are critical for this set to function properly, as otherwise Cinccino may miss out on several KOes. As an additional note, entry hazards in conjunction with Cinccino's U-Turn can put the opponent in a rather awkward position, as this can wear Cinccino's counters down to the point that it can dispose of them rather easily. Garbodor is a good partner who can set up Spikes, as it also resists Fighting-type moves which Cinccino tends to draw in. Stealth Rock is also a great option; Golem is a good idea for this role due to its high Attack stat. Wallbreakers are also appreciated, as Cinccino does not have the immediate strength to take out many Pokemon with this set. Zangoose, Sawsbuck, Golurk, and Emboar are all excellent examples, as they can break apart several defensive cores, and at least weaken weather abusers before Cinccino comes into play.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Unfortunately, besides the options listed, Cinccino doesn't have many other options to choose from due to its narrow movepool. Aqua Tail may be used on any set, but its coverage is largely redundant in conjunction with Cinccino's main coverage moves. A weather support set may be used with Heat Rock or Damp Rock due to Cinccino's blazing Speed, but it can't take advantage of weather itself, save for possibly the previously mentioned Aqua Tail in rain. A Work Up set with Substitute may work, but Cinccino generally has a hard time finding turns where it can set up both a Substitute and Work Up. Cinccino isn't all that powerful either after a boost, which makes setting up almost pointless. Cinccino has access to Encore and Knock Off to support its teammates, but again, it cannot abuse the effects of these moves directly unlike other Pokemon. Technician is a possibility on any set if you feel that it can outdamage Skill Link; however, Skill Link almost always outclasses it competitively. Return may also be used for perfect accuracy, but Tail Slap is much stronger with Skill Link factored in. Lastly, King's Rock may be used on a set, as it provides an incredible flinching rate, thanks to Cinccino's multi-hit moves. However, the loss of power from Life Orb is very apparent when running King's Rock, and it causes Cinccino to miss out on several 2HKOes.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>True counters to Cinccino are hard to come by in this metagame, as many popular physical walls are 2HKOed by Cinccino with its Life Orb or Choice Band set. Misdreavus is possibly the best counter out there, as it is only 3HKOed by Rock Blast from the Choice Band set, while in return Misdreavus can use Pain Split to heal itself, or just neuter Cinccino with Will-O-Wisp. Tangela is one of the best defensive answers, having the ability to use Leech Seed to steal some HP from Cinccino, and then switching right back out to get a third of its health back with Regenerator. Probopass and Bastiodon are only 3HKOed by any attack from Cinccino besides Wake-Up Slap, and even then they can survive if Sturdy activates. There are also a small number of Steel-types which, despite seeing little to no use in NU, hard counter Cinccino every time. Intimidate Mawile and Klang resist Cinccino's entire moveset and can 2HKO it in return. If Cinccino is becoming particularly annoying, you can always slap a Rocky Helmet on something that can tank a Tail Slap, such as Amoonguss or Carracosta. This shaves off one-sixth of Cinccino's health every time Tail Slap hits, meaning it will be very nearly dead after attacking once. Keep in mind, though, that Bullet Seed and Rock Blast aren't contact moves, so Rocky Helmet won't affect them. All of these must watch out if Cinccino uses U-Turn, as once Cinccino switches out, a Pokemon will be switching in that can probably take care of whatever is bothering Cinccino.</p>

<p>Many of the bulkier offensive Pokemon in NU, such as Gurdurr or Eelektross, have the ability to take a Tail Slap and OHKO Cinccino in return. Revenge killing is a much easier way to take care of Cinccino due to its frailty. Any Pokemon that can outspeed it, either naturally or by use of Choice Scarf, is a solid check. Priority also beats any Cinccino, since it bypasses our cuddly friend's outstanding Speed stat. Given that priority moves are staples on some of the most common Pokemon in the metagame, Cinccino is often hard-pressed to survive. Additionally, entry hazards are a great way to further weaken Cinccino, as it can rack up entry hazard damage from switching in and out constantly. This, in tandem with Life Orb recoil, can shorten Cinccino's lifespan considerably and limit the damage it can do to your team.</p>
