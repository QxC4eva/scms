[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder has a 10% chance of flinching the opponent whenever it attacks. This does not stack with <a href="/bw/items/kings_rock">King's Rock</a> or <a href="/bw/items/razor_fang">Razor Fang</a>. In-game, Stench decreases wild encounter rate.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Stench really isn't that viable, but can be good in a pinch if the luck is going for you. <a href="/bw/pokemon/garbodor">Garbodor</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/skuntank">Skuntank</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/muk">Muk</a> are three candidates for using Stench but the former two have a much better ability in <a href="/bw/abilities/aftermath">Aftermath</a>, and the latter is too slow to effectively make use of it.</p>
