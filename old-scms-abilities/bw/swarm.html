Boosts power of Bug-type moves by 50% when at 1/3 HP or less.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is at 1/3 HP or less, all of its Bug-type moves will have 50% more power.</p>

<p>Outside of battle, it can be used to increase the wild encounter rate.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There isn't much competitive use to this ability, since most Bug-types suck or have better abilities. The best one to look forward to might well be <a href="/bw/pokemon/volcarona">Volcarona</a>, since it takes 50% damage from <a href="/bw/moves/stealth_rock">Stealth Rock</a>, so is worn down quickly, and with <a href="/bw/moves/quiver_dance">Quiver Dance</a> it may well be a potent threat, but unfortunately Swarm is illegal on it at the time of writing, until it is released in the Dream World. <a href="/bw/pokemon/escavalier">Escavalier</a> is also a Pokemon that can hit hard and use strong Bug-type moves, so the boost is welcome there too.</p>
