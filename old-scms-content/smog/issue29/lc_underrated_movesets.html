<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	LC is a metagame that does not have the largest playerbase. The biggest reason for this is because people think that the LC metagame is centralized around the three M's: Murkrow, Misdreavus, and Mienfoo. Despite this apparent domination, there are many gems that have not yet been unearthed. These underrated sets are both unexpected and top-notch. Although the BW LC metagame is soon ending, there is plenty of time to get out there and experience these sets for yourself.

<h3>Choice Scarf Smoochum</h3>

	Smoochum @ Choice Scarf<br/>
	Ability: Forewarn<br/>
	EVs: 240 SpA / 240 Spe<br/>
 	Timid Nature<br/>
 	- Trick<br/>
 	- Blizzard<br/>
 	- Psychic<br/>
 	- Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Grass
</p>

<p>
	Choice Scarf Smoochum might sound like a very odd Pokémon to use in LC, especially considering its weaknesses to Stealth Rock, Sucker Punch, and Pursuit. However, Smoochum's biggest draw is being the most powerful Blizzard user in LC. It sports 85 Special Attack, which is 23 points higher than Snover&mdash;the biggest Blizzard spammer in the tier. Since, in LC, Blizzard is such a spammable move, and with the omnipresence of Snover, being able to sweep through an opponent with this set is a very real possibility. It still has good coverage, thanks to STAB Psychic nailing Fighting-types. Smoochum's Speed is increased through the use of Choice Scarf, and thus it takes the role of a revenge killer as well. 65 Speed is nice to outspeed some top threats, such as Scraggy, and it can actually Speed tie with Scarf Mienfoo. Access to Trick gives it a useful way to cripple opposing mons, especially those such as Dragon Dance Scraggy and Calm Mind Murkrow, as well as break defensive cores that incorporate Pokémon like Foongus and Porygon.

<h3>Support Tirtouga</h3>

	Tirtouga @ Eviolite<br/>
	Ability: Solid Rock<br/>
	EVs: 164 HP / 52 Atk / 12 Def / 16 SpA / 236 SpD / 28 Spe<br/>
	Relaxed Nature<br/>
	- Stealth Rock<br/>
	- Scald<br/>
	- Rock Slide<br/>
	- Knock Off / Aqua Jet
</p>

<p>
	Tirtouga was a forgotten Pokémon back in BW1, but with BW2, LC players have discovered the great sweeper that is Shell Smash Tirtouga. Due to the Shell Smash set dominating usage, its underrated brethren set has gone under the radar. Tirtouga runs an effective support set, thanks to access to Stealth Rock, which is a bit rare in LC, great physical bulk, and the excellent Solid Rock ability, which makes it very bulky, to the point where it can take Earthquakes from Hippopotas and weaker Electric-type moves from Staryu. It also sports the move Knock Off, which is very important in LC to remove Eviolites and thus very welcome. Scald lets it be a huge annoyance to common switch-ins of the Shell Smash sets. This allows it to set up Stealth Rock easily. The set itself benefits greatly from its relative lack of popularity, leading most people to play warily around it, and thus being caught off guard by Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and Scald.

<h3>SubPayback Mienfoo</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/649.png" alt="" /><br />
	Mienfoo @ Life Orb<br/>
	Ability: Regenerator<br/>
 	EVs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe<br/>
 	Jolly Nature<br/>
	- Substitute<br/>
 	- Hi Jump Kick<br/>
 	- Payback<br/>
	- Baton Pass
</p>

<p>
	In a metagame where Misdreavus dominates, any way of reliably luring it in and KOing it has great utility. Meet SubPayback Mienfoo. After a KO, bring in Mienfoo, and use Substitute straight away. If your opponent switches in a slower Fighting-type resistance, such as Croagunk, Baton Pass out to a teammate that can handle it. If they send in Misdreavus, smack it with a super effective 100 Base Power Payback&mdash;a guaranteed OHKO. Once Misdreavus has been KOed, you still have a Pok&eacute;mon with just about the strongest single attack in the metagame, capable of OHKOing all of Murkrow, Archen, Drilbur after Stealth Rock, and Abra after its Focus Sash is broken. Substitute is also an excellent buffer against status, such as Will-O-Wisp from Koffing and Spore from Foongus, and Regenerator heals Mienfoo upon using Baton Pass or switching out. While it's not a replacement for bulky Mienfoo sets, it still has a wonderful niche in the metagame and deserves higher use.
</p>

<h3>Eviolite Snover</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/464.png" alt="" /><br />
	Snover @ Eviolite<br/>
	Ability: Snow Warning<br/>
	EVs: 36 HP / 104 Atk / 36 Def / 184 SpA / 116 SpD<br/>
	Quiet Nature<br/>
	- Blizzard<br/>
	- Giga Drain<br/>
	- Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Rock<br/>
	- Ice Shard
</p>

<p>
	It's all too easy to assume a Snover seen in Team Preview is using a Choice Scarf (it almost always is), and many teams rely on checking it by using Pok&eacute;mon such as Pawniard that resist Blizzard. Eviolite Snover is more powerful than Choice Scarf Snover, as it can use a Quiet nature, and has the ability to switch moves as well, while also having considerable bulk. Because it is slower than Hippopotas, Snover will have hail up and is guaranteed an OHKO after hail damage in a one-on-one matchup. Additionally, Steel-types can no longer switch in to tank a Blizzard with impunity, as Hidden Power Fire on a predicted switch or after hitting with Blizzard will deal hefty damage to Eviolite Pawniard and even specially-defensive Bronzor. Having a Quiet nature makes Eviolite Snover solid to use on teams utilizing Trick Room users, although it is not an overly reliable strategy. Obviously, it can't revenge kill Sand Rush sweepers because it lacks Choice Scarf, but the huge added bulk means Snover can switch into Water-types, including Chinchou and Staryu, and weak (generally special) attackers, such as Shroomish.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
	So there you have it. In a metagame such as LC, where everyone always considers everything standard and unchangeable, there are always some sets that have been left untouched and unpopularized. Winning is not always attained by using the accepted sets as has been proved countless times at the top level and by top players. Get out there and try these sets!
