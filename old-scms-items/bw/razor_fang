[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If Gligar is leveled up at night while holding this item, it will evolve into Gliscor. All moves that actively deal damage and do not already have a chance to flinch will gain a 10% chance of flinching the opponent. (This chance doubles to 20% if the holder has Serene Grace.) This effect does not stack with Stench, and is not affected by Sheer Force.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Razor Fang is best used with Pokemon that have the Skill Link ability and can use a variety of multi-hit moves. Cloyster is a notable example, as it can use Shell Smash and either Icicle Spear or Rock Blast to tear through the opponent's team. Assuming that the move hits five times, Cloyster will have a 41% chance of flinching the foe. Another example is Skill Link Cinccino, which can use Razor Fang along with moves such as Tail Slap or Bullet Seed. Aside from these Pokemon, Razor Fang is generally a bad item to use in competitive battles.</p>
