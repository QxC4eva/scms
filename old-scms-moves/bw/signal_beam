<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to confuse the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Signal Beam is a generally outclassed move. As a specially-based Bug-type move, it is completely outclassed by Bug Buzz due to Bug Buzz's higher Base Power. As a coverage move for the many Psychic-types who receive Signal Beam, Shadow Ball is normally a better choice, as many of these Psychic-types will also have Focus Blast or Hidden Power Fighting to cover Dark-types alongside their STAB and Shadow Ball.</p>
