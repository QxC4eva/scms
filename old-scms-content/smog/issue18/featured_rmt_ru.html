<div id="border">
<p>Hey, everybody, it's Molk; as some of you know I have peaked at #1 this round on the RU ladder for a little while. Well, I have decided to share this team with YOU! YAAAAAY!!!!</p>

<p>This team is a bulky offense team; in such a hyper offensive metagame, you would expect the best teams to be total offense, right? Well, think again.</p>

<p>Once again my team is centered around a Pokémon that isn't usually used, but is viable (last time it was Zweilous); this time it is Klinklang. Klinklang has issues in the higher tiers but down here it is definitely viable. With a combo of typing, stats, and its two signature moves, Klinklang is a force to be reckoned with in RU. Well, let's get to the team, shall we?</p>

<h2>Team summary</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/588.png" alt="Crustle" /> <img src="/download/sprites/bw/480.png" alt="Gallade" /> <img src="/download/sprites/bw/631.png" alt="Klinklang" /> <img src="/download/sprites/bw/470.png" alt="Tangrowth" /> <img src="/download/sprites/bw/451.png" alt="Munchlax" /> <img src="/download/sprites/bw/484.png" alt="Rotom" />

<h2>How does this team work?</h2>

<p>The basic core of this team is Tangrowth+Munchlax+Rotom. The idea is to set up hazards with Crustle at the beginning of the match, while forcing switches with Tangrowth and Munchlax. Rotom-N makes an excellent check to Honchkrow while also spinblocking, Gallade makes an excellent wallbreaker/bulky sweeper to go along with the "bulky" style, and then there's Klinklang, the star of the team and late game sweeper. As well as the most offensive member of the team, Klinklang comes in once the opposing team is weakened enough to hazards, sets up and sweeps. He's also another check to Honchkrow. Klinklang can set up rather easily with its excellent typing and sweep mid-game if there is nothing that resists its coverage.</p>

<h2>What threatens this team?</h2>

<p>Keep your pants on. This team isn't perfect; there are things that threaten it. This team has trouble with Gligar, Entei, and Moltres in particular, Gligar walls my entire team once Rotom is down, while Entei and Moltres do the same once Munchlax has gone to lunch so to speak. Especially if my backup check Rotom has gone down. Toxic Spikes also give this team trouble, hitting all but Rotom and Klinklang and reducing Tangrowth's lifespan considerably.</p>

<h2>A look at the Pokémon</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/588.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Crustle</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
EVs: 196 HP / 252 Atk / 60 Spe<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- X-Scissor</p>

<p>Despite his life being relatively short-lived, Crustle is a very important member of my team. Sturdy allows me a guaranteed Stealth Rock to work with at least, most likely one or more layers of Spikes. The Lum Berry allows him to make a makeshift check to Lilligant as well if he's still alive. Absorbing the sleep and counterattacking with X-Scissor, Stone Edge gives me a weapon vs lead Moltres trying to avoid Stealth Rock. The EV spread maximizes Crustle's attack while also giving Crustle a bit of bulk and being able to outspeed some slower Pokémon. </p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/480.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Gallade</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
EVs: 240 HP / 224 SpD / 44 Spe<br />
Ability: Steadfast<br />
Careful Nature (+SpD, -SpA)<br />
- Bulk Up<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Shadow Sneak<br />
- Substitute</p>

<p>All in all, Bulk Up Gallade is the equivalent of "come at me bro". Gallade comes in on a weak wall such as Slowking and sets up a Sub to avoid the status; from here Gallade can set up a Bulk Up. Drain Punch is Gallade's main STAB, providing recovery and just screaming COME AT ME BRO. Shadow Sneak is great priority to finish off fast ghosts such as Rotom and Haunter, as well as picking off possible revenge killers. Gallade is my main wallbreaker for Klinklang to sweep, taking out Pokémon such as Magneton and Ferroseed for Klinklang.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/631.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Klinklang</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
EVs: 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Shift Gear<br />
- Gear Grind<br />
- Return<br />
- Substitute</p>

<p>This is my late game cleaner. After a Shift Gear, Klinklang outspeeds Scarved base 100s. After that, Gear Grind becomes massively powerful, 2HKOing even walls such as Tangrowth. Return allows Klinklang to hit Water-types such as Slowking. Substitute works well with Klinklang's typing and bulk. It also gives Klinklang a chance to survive priority. Watch in amzement as Klinklang's gears start moving faster and faster, then watch in horror as my Klinklang shreds your team to pieces.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/470.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Tangrowth</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
Relaxed Nature (+Def, -Spe)<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Power Whip<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Leech Seed</p>

<p>The master of swag from my last team is back for some more action on my new team. Tangrowth lols at even boosted attacks and puts them to sleep, effectively rendering them useless for the rest of the match. After switching out, Tangrowth recovers some health, most likely about as much as it took while in. Power Whip shows Tangrowth's serious swag as it whoops the opponents ass down; for a defensive Pokémon this attack is very powerful. Hidden Power Fire makes tangrowth lol at Durant and Ferroseed switching in and is usually a nasty surprise from the swag beast. Leech Seed gives Tangrowth more recovery and allows Tangrowth to support the team, especially Gallade and Rotom.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/451.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Munchlax</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
EVs: 104 HP / 224 Def / 180 SpD<br />
Ability: Thick Fat<br />>
Careful Nature (+SpD, -SpA)<br />
- Body Slam<br />
- Whirlwind<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>

<p>Munchlax is my check to Entei, Moltres, and Lilligant as well as my special wall and phazer. Body Slam provides paralysis support for the team while also giving Munchlax an offensive presence. Whirlwind is one of the cruxes of this team, phazing out ghosts, and forcing Pokémon to take hazard damage. Munchlax causes more destruction than it looks like it can! Rest and Sleep Talk allow Munchlax to absorb sleep and check Lilligant if it Sleep Talks a Whirlwind.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/484.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Rotom</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Pain Split<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Shadow Ball</p>

<p>Rotom is possibly the most important member of my team; it spinblocks and checks many things that this this would usually have trouble handling, like mixed Honchkrow. Thunderbolt+Shadow Ball gives very good coverage and allows me to beat things such as Moltres and opposing Rotom. Substitute is the key to beating Honchkrow, protecting yourself from Sucker Punch while Pain Split heals HP back. The 4 SpD EVs are for the rare Download Porygon-Z, giving it an attack boost. Rotom is also my best answer to Sap Sipper Bouffalant. I can honestly say that this team wouldn't be where it is without Rotom-N &lt;3</p>

<p>Well, after the suspect testing round is over, I'm probably going to retire this team; feel free to rate my team, I will admit it is pretty good but it's not perfect.</p>

<p>TRY OUT RU SOME TIME, IT'S A FUN COMMUNITY FULL OF NICE PEOPLEZ AND THERE'S LITTLE WEATHER THERE.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>RU is a relatively new tier, originating in the 5th generation. Out of all the current tiers, RU is probably one of the most, if not the most, versatile metagame to play, thanks to its colorful variety of usable Pokémon, different playstyles, and constant unpredictability. Molk's team exemplifies what RU is all about&mdash;he takes a mixture of offense with a dash of stall, and creates a very wholesome bulky offense team that has managed to be very successful.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p>Looking at Molk's team, it is easily noticeable that Crustle is most likely his 'lead', in the sense that it will usually try to start off the game by setting up entry hazards. Getting entry hazards up are extremely important to this team's success, as he has two set-up sweepers in the form of Bulk Up Gallade and Shift Gear Klinklang. Another member of his team, Munchlax, also takes advantage of entry hazards by phazing with Whirlwind. In fact, nearly all the members of Molk's team make great use of entry hazards. Tangrowth forces many switches with the imminent threat of Sleep Powder, while SubSplit Rotom also forces many switches.</p>

<p>As Molk has stated himself, there is a clear defensive core that includes Tangrowth, Munchlax, and Rotom. After entry hazards have been set up by Crustle, Tangrowth and Munchlax work in tandem to force many switches, quickly racking up damage. Tangrowth's gigantic Defense stat helps it absorb the physical attacks aimed at Munchlax, while Munchlax can take virtually any Fire- or Ice-type attack aimed at Tangrowth with the help of Eviolite, its massive HP stat, and its Thick Fat ability. Rotom serves as the team's spinblocker, and can dish out a fair amount of damage with its useful dual STAB combo.</p>

<p>Another interesting aspect of the team is that Molk takes both a very well-known set-up sweeper in the form of Bulk Up Gallade and a lesser-known, perhaps quite underrated set-up sweeper in the form of Shift Gear Klinklang. These two have remarkable offensive synergy with each other&mdash;Gallade takes out the many Steel-types, such as Magneton and Steelix, that give Klinklang problems, while Klinklang demolishes any faster Pokemon that threaten Gallade after the Speed and Attack boosts. Molk's team is well-catered to Klinklang, which needs an enormous amount of support in order to properly pull off a sweep. Even after a Shift Gear boost, Klinklang's power output is rather mediocre, which explains the reasoning behind multiple entry hazards&mdash;they make it much more easy for Klinklang to nab those crucial KOs. Bulk Up Gallade also benefits from numerous entry hazards, as it isn't designed to hit hard right off the bat.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><img src="/smog/issue18/featuredrurmt_klingklang.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Although most teams carry some combination of entry hazards, spinners, sweepers, and more, Molk's team actually lacks a spinner. Ordinarily, this might seem a bit strange; however, only one member of the team is actually weak to Stealth Rock, while there are two members that resist it. The one member that is weak to Stealth Rock is also the 'lead', meaning that it usually won't be around late-game. Molk's team functions well without a Rapid Spin user, though Toxic Spikes are somewhat of an annoyance for most of the team.</p>

<h2>Threats</h2>

<p>Of course, there isn't ever a perfect team, and Molk's team is no exception. Several top RU threats such as Gligar, Entei, and Moltres can wreak havoc on this team if given the opportunity. Gligar manages to wall nearly the entire team, with the exception of Rotom, and can spread Toxic and Taunt Gallade and Klinklang to prevent them setting up. Entei hits insanely hard with STAB Flare Blitz, and only Munchlax can withstand the assault. Moltres is similar in that it 2HKOes or OHKOes nearly every team member, with the exception of Munchlax. Therefore it is obvious that Munchlax is quite an important team member, blocking any attempts to eliminate the rest of the team from the likes of Entei and Moltres. Finally, as previously mentioned, Toxic Spikes can really throw a wrench in any plans that the team might have in mind&mdash;especially setting up.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hitting number one on any ladder is by no means an easy feat, and Molk has managed to do so with his excellently-built and well-thought-out team. An excellent team with few exploitable weaknesses, "Metal Machines" has proven itself worthy of being one of the best anti-metagame teams, and really gives an insight on what RU is really all about. The team is not only successful, but creative, and that is the mark of an excellent player.</p>
