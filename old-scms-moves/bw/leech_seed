<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Plants a seed on the target. The target loses 1/8 of its maximum HP at the end of every turn, and the user gains the amount of HP lost. Leech Seed's effect lasts until the target switches out. If the user switches out, then the Pokemon that replaced it gains the healing effect. If the target KOes a Pokemon on the user's team while under the effect of Leech Seed, it does not lose any HP on that turn. Leech Seed's effect is prevented by Magic Guard. Grass-types are unaffected. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Using Rapid Spin frees the user from Leech Seed. In a double or triple battle, if the Pokemon being healed by Leech Seed is KOed, and there are no Pokemon on its team to replace it, then the effect disappears. If Big Root is held by the recipient, the HP recovered is 1.3x normal, rounded half down. If the target has the ability Liquid Ooze, no HP will be restored and the user will take damage instead.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Leech Seed is one of the best support moves in the game. It is almost always found on any defensive Grass-type that learns it, and can be used just as well by offensive Pokemon. On defensive Pokemon, Leech Seed provides additional recovery, sapping the HP of the target. This gives your Pokemon an immediate advantage, which can be passed to other team members for recovery support, similar to Wish passing. Leech Seed is sometimes the only form of recovery a Pokemon uses. Ferrothorn is an excellent exampleâ€”its relatively low HP ensures a sizable return from the target's HP, and this damage stacks with other residual damage, such as that from Iron Barbs, to deadly effect.</p>

<p>Offensive Pokemon can employ the tried and true SubSeed strategy. This pairs well with good offensive coverage, and makes fast frail Pokemon much harder to deal with. Breloom is one of the most famous SubSeeders, commonly pairing Substitute and Leech Seed with the unique SporePunch combo. This blend of strategies allows Breloom to bypass faster threats, threaten stall, and completely neutralize checks. This is one of the best examples of Leech Seed's utility.</p>
