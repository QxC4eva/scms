<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The OMPL returned this year with a brand new season filled with many exciting battles and many wonderful teams. This year's league was a bit different, as it featured many more underdogs who hadn't really been showcased in the competitive community. Many users, such as word, Kl4ng, and Asterat, proved their battling ability and were able to hold their own. Each round was filled with exciting battles, and each round, the Bedroom Blisseys creeped closer to victory. Right from the start, the Squirmy Earthwyrms had appeared to be the contender to beat, but they were beaten by the underdogs, the Bedroom Blisseys. The Blisseys led a fantastic season, going 6-0 and nearly all of their team was composed of top players. Nobody really knew of these players, however, and they silently crept to prominence. This season was hosted by <a href="/forums/members/.191842/">Monte Cristo</a> and <a href="/forums/members/.27554/">Arcticblast</a> and was a great season for all to enjoy!</p><br />

<h2>Interview with Birkal</h2>
<div id="interview">
    <div class="aside">I wake up to the sound of a bird cawing. Glancing at my watch, I notice it is the day of my big interview with Birkal and that I must get going! I spring out of bed and rush to put on my suit for this interview; we've chosen to meet at his office. In my left ear I faintly hear, "kacaw", but I choose to shake it off, thinking it must just be pre-interview jitters. Disregarding the jitters, I grab a cup of joe and hop into my car.</div>
 
    <div class="aside">Rushing up to the menacing building, I slowly start to realize that it is shaped like a giant Wingull&mdash;could this be a coincidence? Checking my watch once again, I see that the time is 11:01, and the interview was supposed to start at 11:00! I rush up the steps and, of course, drop my briefcase, spilling its contents on the steps. Quickly gathering the items and recollecting myself, I head through the doors. I rush up to the elevator as quickly as I can and hop in. As the elevator rises, I begin to hear the constant sound of a bird going, "kacaw"; the pre-interview jitters are here to haunt me once again. I get out of the elevator and see Birkal's impressive office.</div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>Hey there, Birkal! Would you care to start off by telling us a bit about yourself?</p></div>
 
    <div class="aside"><p>I glance around at the massive Wingull paintings scattered about the room.</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>Sure thing! I am the head moderator of the Create-A-Pok&eacute;mon Project and a Super Moderator on Smogon. More importantly, I'm the cruel gangmaster of the shady hitmob known as the Bedroom Blisseys.</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>Great, lol! So, time for some real questions. You ready for this? </p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>Yep. :></p></div>
 
    <div class="aside"><p>I notice a slight grin on Birkal's face, I have a feeling that things are about to get interesting.</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>Great :]. Let's get started, then. Your team won the OMPL this year, but more interesting than that is your team's name! Tell me how you came up with the "Bedroom Blisseys"!</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p> Yeah, the team name is pretty integrated with our entire philosophy, really. Or more specifically, I was asked to provide a team name, so I was like, 'uhh, I am sitting in my bedroom... Blissey starts with B, I guess?' and then all of us who were in the conversation started cracking up. And the rest is a history and lifetime of bedroom bliss.</p></div>
 
    <div class="aside"><p>I think quietly to myself of Birkal using Assault Vest Blissey.</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>Lol, nice! Anyways, this was an exciting season filled with many good players and replays. How did you select your team roster?</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>Well, I knew I wanted someone who watched PS! frequently and was smart. I'd worked with The Immortal in the past, and when we were chatting it up, I knew I wanted him to be the central cog of the team.</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>Hmm, interesting. Was there any player in particular you were eyeing that you did or did not get?</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>To be honest, a lot of the final roster was because of The Immortal and his scouting. He brought names to me, I'd look at their track record and provide some input. I knew I wanted word and Heisenerg, if I recall correctly. Uhh, there aren't really any good players who aren't on the Blisseys LOL, but let me take a look. Also, I knew I wanted qwilphish because of CAP, and I know he's a cool, open-minded guy who isn't bad. I remember seeing Kl4ng and thinking that he looked pretty good? I think he was really expensive though, so I wasn't really interested. I sort of wanted lasagne too because of my work with him in the past (some CAP stuff), but that wasn't a deal breaker either. Adrian seemed popular but not that good?? I am not sure if he won matches, lol. But I am sure he is an upstanding lad.</p></div>
 
    <div class="aside"><p>Lasagne was starting to sound good now; I hadn't had anything to eat yet today!</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>Interesting, interesting. Well, were you impressed with your final roster in the end?</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>Yeah, I was really excited, and so was TI. We got pretty much everyone on both of our lists that we wanted. We got in contact with everyone right away, built a #bedroom, and got to sharing teams and practicing right off the bat. Everyone seemed pumped and wanted to actually put some effort into this. Also, we just picked ourselves up and ran with it. :></p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>Great. :] During each round, did you have any concern that your team was going to slip? There were some close matchups, particularly in the final week, in which it was 3-3, with the final battle coming down to Knight of Cydonia vs. WaterBomb. Did you have complete faith in your team or were you a bit worried?</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>I dunno, the boys practiced hard and won games consistently. I've assistant managed the Raiders twice in the actual SPL, and while you try your best, each week feels like an uphill battle, y'know? Here in OMPL, I genuinely felt that our team was the best. Morale was high throughout, and everyone was supportive. We worked cohesively as a team and didn't begrudge someone for losing (except TI because he lost like every match, lol). So did I ever think my team was going to lose a week? Not really, we prepared and worked hard. That being said, the finals were a bit of a nail-biter, especially with word breaking down. =(</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>Ouch, that was a bit rough. You guys did pull through, though! So, what did winning OMPL mean to you?</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>Winning OMPL meant that Eevee General looked like the biggest knob gobbler on the forums for making <a href="/forums/threads/.3509786/page-7#post-5588997">this</a> post. ;]</p></div>
 
    <div class="aside"><p>I giggle quietly to myself as I imagine Eevee General sobbing silently to himself.</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>But seriously, I was glad for the Bedroomers that they had worked so hard. They deserved every bit of glory they got for it. I dunno if any other premier league on Smogon has had a team with an undefeated season, so I hope we can boast about it!</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>You most definitely can! Anyways, what was a highlight match to you? Did a certain battle keep you on the edge of your seat, did you have a specific one you were excited to see, etc?</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>I got two for ya -- I was really excited for <a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/almostanyability-141530837">this</a> match during week one because I put Zewwok in. At the time, iirc, he was sort of a no-namer. He had shown a lot of initiative, and I thought he was a pretty decent battler, so I put him in; this was one of the few times TI and I weren't completely in sync, but I wanted to give him a shot! And he nailed it with the win that week and went on to have a pretty successful season. :> I really wanted him to win versus Monte Cristo in week one because I thought that Monte was very cocky. Secondly, practically anyone of word's matches, lol. I pulled <a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/stabmons-144121210">this</a> from week two, although I'm sure enough it's not his best match. Word had an incredible season and was totally worth the 27500 we spent on him. He was a nice team contributor and a great battler, so yeah, any of the matches he played is pretty killer.</p></div>

    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>Word is quite a good battler and in my opinion, this was his breakthrough into the competitive scene forum-wise. If you don't mind my asking, what did you think of word before (and after) you saw him battling?</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>TI had seen him on ladders; I, on the other hand, hadn't heard a ton about him. I watched a match or two of his and instantly knew he was gonna be hot.</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>Nice! So, most importantly, did you guys print off Bedroom Blissey merchandise to brag to your friends about?</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>Ugh, I WISH! I do have my swag Smogon University T-shirt, which I got when chaos gave a bunch of them to senior staff as a test run a while back. But no Blissey attire, unfortunately&mdash;I'll have to look into it.</p></div>

    <div class="aside"><p>And here I was, hoping to walk off of the scene with a Blissey T-shirt. Next time.</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>:] Thanks, Birkal! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we conclude this interview?</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>Yeah, I'd like to formally apologize to all of the other teams for getting thrashed so horribly; hopefully, there is no bad blood. ;( particularly the swamperts ;)</p></div>

    <div class="aside"><p>I try to smile though the pain, knowing how rudely he has just insulted my beloved team. But who can stay mad at Birkal?!</p></div>
     
    <div class="speaker birkal"><img src="/smog/issue25/arterview_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" /><p>But seriously, Other Metagames is an incredible forum. I was its advocate during the planning phases, and although it has gone through a lot of drama and remodels, it is still a hoppin' place where anyone can dream up a cool metagame that anyone can enjoy. So yeah, thanks to all of you who are reading this and participating! Keep on workin' at one of the most genuinely fun places on this forum!</p></div>
 
    <div class="speaker unf"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" /><p>Lol. thanks a ton for this interview,; it was great having you! :]</p></div>

    <div class="aside"><p>I stand up and exit Birkal's office, and relief floods over me as I finish conducting my interview. If only I had a Blissey T-shirt in my hand right now.</p></div>
