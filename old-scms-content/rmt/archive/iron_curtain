<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hi everyone, this is my third RMT for generation 5. I am sure most of you know me anyway, and Gyarados is still much more awesome than this RMT. Hope you do not mind it. This time I decided to revive Classic Stall, it is still a very effective play style but is sadly ignored. I named it Iron Curtain and More Stall than the Bathroom because Colonel_M and Eo gave me the idea. It seems to fit well with the RMT since all the members in this team are ROCK HARD, even Palkia is deceptively bulky. What's more interesting, Eo Ut Mortus and Colonel_M are both awesome dudes and they seem to be the best.</p>

<p>With Drown All and rain teams getting more and more popular, I am posting Classic Stall which is actually sun based. This team is in the Ubers article but I doubt people even notice it so I am posting it here. Blissey needs to be used more because leftovers is actually a pretty big advantage, with Giratina, Groudon and Lugia around, the loss of physical bulk from Chansey isn't much of a big deal.</p>

<p>If this team gets popular, Heatran and Dark Arceus might once again be popular again LOL I had a fun time trolling the ladder with Gyarados, but I guess I should post a more serious team as an RMT. </p>

<p>This team did reasonably well, it goes down to hax sometimes but otherwise Classic Stall is still one of my best teams ever. I didn't use it much on ladder because the ladder to be honest sucks. Most great battlers don't ladder much anyway. Eo and Tyranel_M are great examples. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, this RMT is aiming to popularize GIRATINA. Yeah the CAPS are a must because Giratina is always bashed for being useless. I don't see much RMTs with Giratina, also Giratina walls any Swords Dance Arceus version but Dragon who still loses to Giratina one-on-one anyway. How can we forget the mightiness of the overall bulkiest pokemon in the game? Lunar New Year is coming, so I am trying to make/remake an awesome team as a gift for new Ubers battlers who might want some help at first. Have a blast reading this RMT </p>

<h2>Team Building</h2>

<p>1) Lugia, Giratina and Blissey are staples so I have to include them for Classic Stall. If you want to stall, you have to use at least one of them.</p>

<p>2) Groudon is pretty important for the sun and providing an answer to Zekrom. I could try using Kyogre instead but since sun teams are decreasing in usage, I picked sun instead like the DPP Classic Stall. Groudon also has the advantage of nullifying Kyogre's immense power. We all know Kyogre is way more threatening than Groudon offensively. As strong as Groudon's Choice Band Earthquake is, it pales in comparison to Choice Specs Kyogre's maximum power Water Spout. Even Surf out damages Earthquake due to the weather boost.</p>

<p>3) Blissey > Chansey because I like to switch around more and Blissey is already being used in Ubers stall since RSE. I am keeping that tradition. Also, while this is unlikely, in a Blissey vs Chansey match, Blissey will emerge victorious all the time.</p>

<p>4) Palkia over Latias because Latias sucks now without Soul Dew. It also gives me a revenge killer and check to Darkrai and Mewtwo. Latias is either too slow, weak or not bulky enough. </p>

<p>5) I think I need something that can sweep and phaze at the same time, so I removed Reflect on Lugia and put in Calm Mind. It worked incredibly well. It is also very unexpected to see a Whirlwind Lugia carrying Ice Beam.</p>

<p>6) Forretress becomes the Spikes user of choice, because of Toxic Spikes and Rapin Spin. Giratina + Forretress is a pretty solid combination! Unlike Ferrothorn, Forretress can spin and it can defeat Deoxys-A one-on-one due to the lack of weakness to Superpower.</p>

<p>7) The team is set and it owns a lot, maybe even more successfully than in DPP because Heatran no longer exists. OK, I agree Heatran could give this team some major issues, which is why I put in Earth Power on Palkia in the first place.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/383.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Groudon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Drought<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 56 Def / 200 SpD<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Dragon Tail<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Fire Blast</p>

<p>Groudon is always one of the best wall for a stall team as it almost always manages to reliably get Stealth Rock up. Groudon summons sunlight so this is automatically considered sun stall. Groudon can also phaze well with Dragon Tail which not only deals damage from Groudon's massive physical Attack stat but smashes through Taunt as well. Earthquake is a powerful STAB attack, and is needed to check things like Bulk Up Dialga and Zekrom or even Heatran. Fire Blast fills up the last slot to deal with Steel-type Spikers which are extremely annoying to the team otherwise such as Ferrothron and Skarmory. Fire Blast owns Gliscor and prevents it from getting a free Substitute. </p>

<p>The EVs give Groudon some mixed defenses, extra physical Defense is not needed too much as Lugia and Giratina are present in the team. The extra Special Defense allows Groudon to take on Dialga and Darkrai better. It also allows me to beat Heatran one-on-one since I can survive an unboosted Fire Blast.</p>

<p>I need Groudon to take out opposing Forretress as it is my only way of killing it fast besides Palkia's Fire Blast. The sun Groudon brings helps this team a lot but I am considering Stone Edge because Ho-Oh is a bitch to deal with even with Giratina and Lugia in the team.</p>

<p><strong>Forretress</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Sassy Nature<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Toxic Spikes<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Gyro Ball</p>

<p>Once incredibly popular in DPP as the only viable Ubers spinner, now it faces severe competition from Ferrothorn as a Spikes user.</p>

<p>Forretress is the only viable Rapid Spinner in Ubers that functions well in the sun. Toxic Spikes help stall out a lot of Pokemon such as Mewtwo and Arceus. Forretress is also chosen for his ability to lay Spikes to prevent the opponent from switching frequently. This metal bug is also very useful due to its Steel-typing, being able to easily switch into Dragon-type attacks and set up more entry hazards to the further hinder the opponent. </p>

<p>Maximum special bulk is now standard on Ubers Forry to ensure Forretress isn't crushed by most special attacks. Rapid Spin is needed to spin away hazards that greatly hamper this team's defensive core. There are a few other moves I am considering: I sometimes use Hidden Power Ice to be anti-Gliscor and it hits Garchomp fairly hard. We all know how annoying Gliscor can be if it managed to setup. I am using Gyro Ball now but I don't have much problems with Sub Dakrai at the moment. Toxic seems to fit in on Forretress too to prevent any setup attempts. Volt Switch is pretty much useless but it helps to scout and KO Cloyster and Gyarados. </p>

<p><strong>Blissey</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD <br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Protect<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Wish</p>

<p>Blissey is a key member on any Uber stall team [first used in Classic Stall] along due to her ability to wall nearly every single special attacker in the game. In Ubers, unlike standard, Blissey needs a Calm nature with special powerhouses like Reshiram running rampant. Wish allows me to nearly full restore teammates, and Protect lets scout and rack up Poison damage. Seismic Toss is mandatory as it her only way of dealing damage, and Toxic lets me stall out Pokemon that are immune to Toxic Spikes due to Levitate or Flying typing such as Latias and Lugia. Wish allows Blissey to be a real team player. Seismic Toss is Blissey's only way to touch Dialga and Heatran, both annoying stall breakers so it is the preferred option. Blissey over Chansey because Blissey scouts better, has leftovers so she isn't worn down fast by entry hazards. Blissey also deals with Heatran better with passive recovery. Since this team focuses on Toxic Spikes a bit, Blissey is the better choice.</p>

<p>I am thinking about Snatch to own Dark Arceus if this still exists. Snatch also prevents a 1 layer Toxic Spikes poisoned Ghost Arceus from sweeping the team. So far, Dark Arceus is so rare, I dropped Snatch, besides, Dark Arceus sucks in general compared to Ghost Arceus.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/492.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Giratina</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk<br />
- Dragon Tail</p>

<p>Another one of Classic Stall's main pokemon, I have finally decided to make an RMT on it for BW Ubers. Giratina has been long forgotten as a Great Wall so I am taking this opportunity to bring it back to glory.</p>

<p>Giratina walls many threats including opposing Groudon, Scarf Kyogre and the deadly Ho-Oh. Giratina has extremely high defenses and it blocks any Rapid Spin attempts from all users. The only one which stands at chance at breaking Giratina is Excadrill who needs some entry hazards on the field with some hax to do it. Will-O-Wisp is standard on Giratina, it cripples physical attackers and Steel-types such as Steel Arceus who can be troublesome otherwise. Giratina is also the team's answer to Victini and Blaziken, both who become incredibly powerful in the sun. Rest and Sleep Talk is all Giratina has for recovery. Dragon Tail fills up the last slot so that Giratina can phaze and deal some decent damage in the process thanks to STAB. </p>

<p>I am actually considering using Earthquake because Heatran sucks ass. I hate losing Sleep Talk though but Giratina just sits there anyway, maybe slap some threats out with Dragon Tail. He doesn't do much really besides phazing and burning things. However, Giratina's immense bulk can come in handy sometimes such as when handling Ground Arceus who could be troublesome to the team otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Palkia</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Thunder<br />
- Earth Power</p>

<p>Don't listen to firecape, Latias sucks without Soul Dew. What's worse, Latias will definitely fail in countering Specs Kyogre without her mystical item. Palkia is a natural fit in this team over Latias because most teams in DPP picked either Latias or Palkia anyway as their Water Spout absorber. Latias even fails to counter Manaphy this generation which sucks.</p>

<p>Palkia is the only one capable of absorbing Specs Water Spout in the team as Giratina is using a physically defensive spread. Draco Meteor maims the many Dragon-types in the tier and is Palkia's strongest attack in neutral weather. Fire Blast destroys Steel-types including Ferrothorn. Earth Power is used in the last slot because Heatran SUCKS. Earth Power also hits Dialga fairly hard especially if the weather is rainy. I am considering Hydro Pump because Heatran sucks so much it no longer exists, probably due to the increasing Gyarados usage.</p>

<p>Palkia still works like the usual Scarf Palkia in any other team. Latias is unable to fit in anymore in Classic Stall. Revenge killing Darkrai and Mewtwo is always a great bonus. It can also deal with Dragon Dance Rayquaza if both Lugia and Groudon are weakened.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/249.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Lugia</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 176 Def / 80 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Roost<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Whirlwind</p>

<p>Since this is Classic Stall, without Lugia, it wouldn't even be Classic Stall lol. Lugia is just THAT much of a beast, and I am surprised why his usage dropped.</p>

<p>I guess it might become boring for people because I always post RMTs featuring Lugia. Lugia is my favourite Pokemon to use, after Gyarados of course! Gyarados doesn't thrive in the Ubers metagame but I like him so much it doesn't matter! The thing you should notice is I always change Lugia sets in every RMT I post. Instead of using Drown All's Sub Lugia, this time I decided to use Calm Mind Lugia while retaining much of Lugia's bulk. Lugia fits in the last slot because it checks threats the other walls fail to counter such as Mixed Bulk Up Dialga, and phazing things in general. </p>

<p>A Bold nature is used to absorb more hits while the random Special Defense EVs are for surviving 2 Thunders from most Palkia and Kyogre. Whirlwind allows the team to abuse the hazards and phaze out setup sweepers. Ice Beam destroys Rayquaza, Salamence and hurts Groudon or Ground Arceus. Roost over Recover because Lugia wants to stall out Stone Edge Groudon while Pressure helps pp stall out even things like Ho-Oh. The good thing about Calm Mind is while Lugia is weak, after a few boosts, even that pathetic Ice Beam will become respectably powerful. Not liking Timid nature because Lugia wants the extra bulk this generation to handle more threats such as Arceus and Excadrill.</p>

<p>The beauty of this set is Lugia can actually sweep on his own! Whirlwind allows me to defeat other Calm Mind users not named Kyogre or Arceus variants carrying Roar. I have even defeated Dark Arceus this way, set up Calm Mind 6 times with it, survive the Judgment and phaze it out. Next, Lugia can proceed to sweep your team. With Toxic Spikes, this set becomes even deadlier because Kyogre and some Arceus formes will now actually lose to Lugia in a Calm Mind war.</p>

<p>So you think you can sweep me with Calm Mind Giratina-O? Lugia steps in and saves the day GG. Even Shadow Ball doesn't do too much. If it does have Shadow Ball, Palkia has an easier time with Giratina-O too.</p>
