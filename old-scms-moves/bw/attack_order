Has a high critical hit rate.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a critical hit rate one stage higher than normal. Assuming there are no other critical hit modifiers in play, this move has a 1/8 chance to get a critical hit instead of a 1/16 chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Attack Order is the perhaps the best physical Bug-type move out there, competing only with Megahorn, but unfortunately only Vespiquen and Smeargle are capable of using it; the former is highly uncommon and the latter has appalling stats and many better things to do. Conclusion: if for some reason you decide to use Vespiquen, use Attack Order.</p>
