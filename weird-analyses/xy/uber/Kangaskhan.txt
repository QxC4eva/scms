Overview
########

Pros:

- Base Attack stat equivalent to 213, thanks to Parental Bond.
- One of the best abilities in the game.
- Above average bulk.
- Priority in Sucker Punch, albeit a little bit unreliable.
- Capable of 2HKO'ing the entire tier after just one Power-Up Punch.
- Ability to hit through Sashes and Substitutes.

Cons:

- Very prone to being burned.
- Blaziken, Arceus-Fighting, and Mega Mewtwo X possess Fighting-type moves and can kill Mega Khan before it can even move.
- Somewhat lacking Speed in the fast Ubers metagame.
- Competes for a Mega Spot, with Gengar, Mewtwo, Scizor, and Blaziken all being phenomenal as well.
- Has many more checks than it did in OU, while also having true counters.
- Fails to beat certain Pokemon if lacking the proper move.
- Lack of any resistances make it hard for it to come in very often.

Moves
========
- Fake Out allows you to revenge kill weakened foes and gives you a turn to Mega Evolve and gain a new Speed tier.
- Return is the mandatory STAB nailing a large portion of the tier.
- Sucker Punch, in conjunction with Fake Out, gives Kangaskhan the ability to pick off weakened threats and serves as a kind of revenge killer.
- Earthquake hits Ferrothorn without taking Iron Barbs damage, while also hitting the many Steel-types in Ubers such as Dialga, Arceus-Steel, and Mega Scizor.
- Crunch nails Giratina on the switch, but does have redundant coverage alongside Sucker Punch, but it eases prediction against slower foes.

Set Details
========
- EVs maximize power and Speed.
- Jolly allows you to outspeed base 90s like Kyogre, while also Speed tieing with other base 100s such as Palkia and other Mega Kangaskhan. It also allows you to outspeed Xerneas before Geomancy.
- Scrappy allows you to hit both Giratina formes on the switch with Return or Fake Out, then dent them severely with Crunch.

Usage Tips
========
- Fake Out gives Kangaskhan space to Mega Evolve and can hit Mega Gengar before it Mega Evolves.
- Never keep Kangaskhan in on any Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp
- Scout for any Pokemon carrying Rocky Helmet before you send Kangaskhan out, as Kangaskhan will take double the Rocky Helmet damage, the same goes for Rough Skin and Iron Barb Pokemon as well.
- This Mega Kangaskhan set is best used as a revenge killer and to punch holes.

Team Options
========

- Ho-oh is a nice partner, as it can break down Steel-types, while also being immune to the Burns that Mega Kangaskhan hates.
- Yveltal can handle Lugia, along with Ghost-types, that give Khan trouble.
- Kyogre and Shaymin-Sky both work well, as they can muscle through Rock Arceus.

Other Options
########
- Adamant nature makes Knagaskhan much more powerful, but it sucks to miss outspeeding base 90s.
- Seismic Toss deals 200 damage every time, allowing it to 2HKO pretty much everything no matter what unless they're Ghost or have a large HP stat.
- Roar is a niche move, but it can get rid of stuff Khan doesn't like, but it requires massively good prediction and generally is a waste of a slot.
- Substitute eases Sucker Punch prediction and shields you from Burns.
- Drain Punch gives you reliable recovery.
- 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe gives you a lot more bulk, but the loss of Speed is very unappealing.
- Toxic slams support Arceus.
- Body Slam does have a nice ~50% chance to paralyze, but it is often too weak too be of use.
- Double-Edge is insanely powerful, but it also comes with very heavy recoil.
- Lastly, Facade is an option, as it takes advantage of Burn, but if it isn't burned, then it is often too weak to be used.
- Power-Up Punch set can be very deadly, but it is often too hard to set up and Mega Kangaskhan is too slow.

Checks & Counters
########
- Mega Lucario, Mega Mewtwo X, and Terrakion can all pick off Kangaskhan with their STAB Fighting-type moves.
- Giratina and Sableye both can Will-O-Wisp Kangaskhan and take nothing from any of Kangaskhan's moves bar Crunch.
- Skarmory can faze it, but takes huge damage from Fire Punch in the process.
- Arceus-Rock walls any set lacking Earthquake.
- Darkrai can put it to sleep and hit it with Focus Blast, however, Darkrai cannot live a Return and Focus Blast has low accuracy and doesn't OHKO it, but it does leave it in a very low health range to be revenge killed.
- Support Arceus formes are good checks, as they can just burn Kangakshan and stall it out.
- Lugia without Power-Up Punch + Crunch.
- Mega Scizor / Ferrothorn / Skarmory / Bronzong if you lack Crunch or Fire Punch.
- Dialga walls any Kangaskhan lacking Earthquake.
- Physically Defensive Yvetlal is a full stop.
- Mega Gengar plays mind games with Destiny Bond and can avoid Sucker Punch if played correctly.
