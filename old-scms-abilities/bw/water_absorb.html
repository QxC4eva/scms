[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder gains 25% of its maximum HP when hit by a Water-type attack and negates the attack. Redirection effects (such as <a href="/bw/abilities/storm_drain">Storm Drain</a>) take effect before Water Absorb activates. Water Absorb activates through <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a> but not <a href="/bw/moves/protect">Protect</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Many good Pokemon get Water Absorb, so competitively it has a lot of uses. Since Water is such a prevalent attacking type this generation, due to the presence of <a href="/bw/abilities/drizzle">Drizzle</a>, being able to take Water attacks becomes all the more important. <a href="/bw/pokemon/vaporeon">Vaporeon</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/jellicent">Jellicent</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/poliwrath">Poliwrath</a> are all great Pokemon to stop rain teams based on Water-types because of this ability, and thus having a Pokemon with Water Absorb can be a great asset.</p>
