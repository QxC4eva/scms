<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the power of all of the holder's damage-dealing Flying-type attacks by 20%.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sharp Beak isn't bad, but it isn't that good either. While a 20% boost to Flying-type attacks is decent, it's not quite as excellent as the 30% boost to all attacks that you get from Life Orb. If you don't like Life Orb's recoil damage, or want to try to bluff a Choice item, then Expert Belt is typically a better overall choice for its added damage to all super effective attacks. Even if you are running a mono-attacking set with Flying coverage (not recommended), either Leftovers or Life Orb would probably be better for your purposes, depending on your build.</p>

<p>Staraptor and others of a Brave Bird disposition will sometimes use Sharp Beak, as the already large recoil accumulated from Brave Bird, possibly on top of sandstorm and Stealth Rock damage, makes extra damage from Life Orb undesirable. In addition, it can potentially allow you to bluff a Choice set should the opportunity present itself.</p>
