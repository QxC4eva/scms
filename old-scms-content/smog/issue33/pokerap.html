Your bars are so big I could connect to Wi-Fi<br />
No flow in your game but props 'cause you tried<br />
Even though spittin' it probably left you tongue-tied<br />
You should just stick to killin' African guys<br />
Let D. Rizzle make it rain green from the sky.<br />

  <div class="battle-section sun">
  <div class="verse">
Nigga you're the one dryin' up 'cause I'm global warming bitch<br />
You little fishies be swimmin' in my mama's ditch<br />
Looks like the sun is makin' ya feel malnourished<br />
Yo raps so desperate it sounds like a sales pitch<br />
Send me your shitty frogs or horses, I don't care which<br />

  <div class="battle-section rain">
  <div class="verse">
Shit man, 5 turns and the rain continues to fall<br />
Suck my Damp Rock like you do a pair of balls<br />
Hurricane spam knockin' niggas to the wall<br />
You can't even take 'em though you're 11 feet tall<br />
And 2,000 pounds of trash if I do recall<br />
Better fuckin' give Weight Watchers a call, lol.<br />
<br />
Damn nigga, and there's a reason why we're 2/3 water<br />
'Cause I'm the big daddy of life, my alma mater<br />
Doin' Mother Nature takin' all that she can offer<br />
She's hotter than your daughter ridin' wands from Harry Potter<br />
Though I guess she rides it well 'cause you're the one who taught her<br />
So better sack your hoes cause they're easy death fodder.
  </div>
</div>

  <div class="battle-section sun">
  <div class="verse">
The only hoes I be sackin' are the ones goin' tannin'<br />
On my Morning Sun, morning wood, giant cannon<br />
But you got no D like the Broncos Peyton Manning<br />
My moves hot like salsa while you just be Rain Dancin'<br />
I'm on that Jumpluff swag, Acrobatics stuck the landin'<br />
Spit that Fire Blast and now our crew's the last one standin'.<br />
<br />
Victreebel be Weather Ballin' with that sizzlin' fire<br />
Slam dunkin' niggas so our victory's acquired<br />
Bellossom bein' awesome 'cause we deeply admired<br />
Deeper than Bikini Bottom in that pineapple spire<br />
I'm the king of rap so please just call me sire<br />
And the head of weather too so you'd best just retire.
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="battle-section rain">
  <div class="verse">
Don't be hatin' just 'cause I got all the hops<br />
I'll dunk you in the sea 'cause I'm sicker than chicken pox<br />
I made a complex ban so you better give me props<br />
Thunder and Hurricane and Coogi down to the socks<br />
Swift Swim with Drizzle rockin' the Kabutops<br />
While all you did in Gen V was run a shitty ass fox.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, what does the fox say? I'm gay<br />
I can cross you up and knock down a trey<br />
Drama on Smogon 'cause Drizzle is a yay<br />
But with Swift Swim that shit is a nay<br />
Ban me 'cause I'm the best with my full display<br />
Who cares about sun 'cause your game's just child's play.

Suddenly, the two rap stars paused for a moment and looked up at the sky&mdash;something wasn't right. The scorching rays of the sun quickly weakened to a mere fragment of what they were. The thunderous rain clouds calmed to irrelevance, and the rain drops instantly evaporated before they could hit the ground. The atmosphere was simply peaceful. But in the distance, 2-Quakez and D. Rizzle saw a figure from beyond, slowly descending from the majestic skies. As it got closer, they both knew exactly who came in for an unwelcoming surprise.
  </div>
<div class="rap-battle">
  <div class="battle-section rayquaza">
  <div class="verse">
I'm RAY-FUCKING-QUAZA rockin' the Air Lock niche<br />
I got 99 problems via Missingno. glitch<br />
Weather to me is just a little jock itch<br />
I should stream your cat-fight to preteens on Twitch<br />
D. Rizzle should shut up and make me a sandwich<br />
Put some extra tuna on that, you little bitch.<br />
<br />
And 2-Quakez? Your rap skills are too fake<br />
I could spit hotter verses with my mind half-baked<br />
You started from the bottom and you're still there, Drake<br />
2,000 pounds of cheesecake and milk shakes<br />
Here's some food for thought: I can crush you like a corn flake<br />
Making people look orange for a living? Give me a break.<br />
<br />
If you got beef then hit me up at Sky Pilla<br />
Mach Bike skills so sweet like vanilla<br />
I'll solo the Elite 4 with 5 other fillas<br />
Dragon Dance Outrage 'cause I'm a ruthless killa<br />
V-Create in your girls who look like they're gorillas<br />
Better call for backup from a pine tree and godzilla.
