Overview
########

- kind of looks sucky
- Dragon with shitty offenses and good bulk but no support movepool
- Ability is literally useless without Xerneas and Yveltal around
- actually one of the best Heatran counters in the game
- incredible bulk and good Speed lets it set up Subs with near impunity
- Once it gets Sub up, it's incredibly difficult to remove it from the battlefield

########

Moves
========

- Substitute and Protect work in tandem to keep Zygarde on the field for ages and divert attention to it
- Land's Wrath, Zygarde's signature move, is a Ground move that hits both of the opponent's Pokemon - with a loss of only ~7.5 base power (after spread reduction) it is much better than Earthquake
- Stone Edge bypasses Wide Guard and smacks Charizard and Talonflame before they can move, and also has slightly more power than Land's Wrath against one opponent
- Rock Slide is a SE alternative if you don't give a fuck about Rock Slide
