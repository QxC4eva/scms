[SHORT DESC]
Deals damage at the end of the turn after three turns.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Deals damage at the end of the turn after three turns.</p>

<p>The damage is based on the Attack and Defense at the time of using Doom Desire, not at the time of striking. This means that if you use Doom Desire on a Pokémon with 100 Defense, and then your opponent switches to a Pokémon with 300 Defense, the damage calculations will be done as though the target has 100 Defense.</p>

<p>Doom Desire is technically typeless, so it does not get STAB, and hits all Pokémon neutrally. It hits through Wonder Guard. Because it damages at the end of the turn, it is not blocked by Detect or Protect, and can KO a Pokémon that used Endure. If the target uses Detect or Protect on the turn Doom Desire is selected, however, that will count as a successful Detect or Protect against Doom Desire.</p>

<p>Multiple Doom Desires cannot be queued for the same Pokémon. Doom Desire must hit the target before it can target that Pokémon again. It uses the same queue as Future Sight, so they cannot be stacked together.</p>

<p>Doom Desire cannot get a critical hit.</p>
