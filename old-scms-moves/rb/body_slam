<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Has a 30% chance to paralyze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Body Slam is an excellent move that most Pokemon with access to it should use. Spreading paralysis amongst the opposing team is very important and the primary goal in any RBY match, and Body Slam helps you achieve that. Furthermore, physical attackers will deal significant amounts of damage using it along with paralyzing, and some, like Tauros, even have STAB on it. Paralysis will severely cripple most Pokemon, granting you a wide advantage. Being fully paralyzed can totally change the outcome of a match, leading to a comeback that grants you a victory you never saw coming.</p>
