Overview
########
While Amoonguss may not be one of the first choices for a team, it has several unique qualities that help it stand out. Its great defensive typing gives it useful resistances to Water-, Electric-, Fighting-, Fairy-, and Grass-type attacks, letting it wall a myriad of common and dangerous threats such as Azumarill, Keldeo, and Thundurus. Where Amoonguss truly shines, however, is its ability to spread debilitating status, particularly sleep, as it has access to the Spore, the only 100% accurate sleep-inducing move in the game. Amoonguss is also incredibly difficult to wear down due to its great bulk and defensive typing, awesome ability in Regenerator, access to Giga Drain, and immunity to Toxic. However, Amoonguss has one major flaw: after putting an opposing Pokemon to sleep, it can't do much to stop another Pokemon from setting up in its face. It also faces severe competition from Mega Venusaur, which is much faster, boasts overall higher stats, and has two fewer weaknesses, thanks to Thick Fat. However, between Regenerator, Spore, and the fact that Amoonguss does not take up a team's valuable Mega Evolution slot, Amoonguss certainly has value over its fellow Grass / Poison type. Overall, despite its shortcomings, if Amoonguss is played carefully, it can provide invaluable support to nearly any team.

Moves
========
Spore is the only 100% accurate sleep move in the game and is one of the main reasons to use Amoonguss. Giga Drain is boosted by STAB and heals Amoonguss, adding to its already great bulk and longevity. Hidden Power Fire is useful for hitting the Grass-types that are immune to Spore, particularly Ferrothorn. It also hits Scizor, Forretress, and Genesect fairly hard. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb is Amoonguss's strongest reliable STAB move and has a 30% chance to poison, though its coverage is only useful for hitting Togekiss, Celebi, and Breloom super effectively. Hidden Power Ice can be used instead if Dragon-types are of particular concern. Stun Spore is great alongside Spore, as it allows Amoonguss to spread status even further. On the other hand, Clear Smog helps prevent it from being setup bait, though some Pokemon such as Talonflame, which can threaten Amoonguss without setting up, can still use it as setup bait. In addition, Steel-type sweepers such as Lucario and Scizor are not affected by the move, so they have free reign to set up on Amoonguss if it has already put something else on the opposing team to sleep. Synthesis can be used for more reliable recovery, but it is a bit redundant with Regenerator, Giga Drain, and Black Sludge recovery, so it is generally inferior to Amoonguss's other moves.

Set Details
========
EVs are put into HP and Defense to capitalize on Amoonguss's great resistances to common physical attacks. This allows it to switch in on and stop powerful physical sweepers such as Mega Lucario by either putting them to sleep or paralyzing them. However, a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature can be used if special attackers are more threatening to your team. Black Sludge is the preferred item, as it provides great passive healing in conjunction with Regenerator. Leftovers can be used over Black Sludge, but Black Sludge is more useful as it cripples Trick users and deters them from using Trick on Amoonguss at all.

Usage Tips
========
As it is a pivot, Amoonguss will be switching in very often throughout the match. It is very easy to switch in, thanks to its resistances, Regenerator, and its ability to wall common Pokemon.

Spore is a very powerful tool and should not be used thoughtlessly. Amoonguss will most often only be able to put one opponent to sleep in the entire match because a sleeping opponent often does not have a chance to wake up, so take note of which Pokemon you want to put to sleep before mindlessly clicking Spore. The mere threat of Spore is also very useful. Predicting which Pokemon the opponent will use as sleep fodder and capitalizing on it not only gains momentum, but it allows you to possibly put a more dangerous Pokemon on the opponent's team to sleep later in the battle. However, Amoonguss can be helpless against certain Pokemon after it has already put something else to sleep. Successfully using Spore to its greatest potential requires prediction and clever planning.

To prevent Amoonguss from being setup bait after Spore has been used, you can utilize double switches to deter the opposing team from setting up on it.

Team Options
========
Amoonguss isn't too support reliant as it is usually the one doing the supporting. It can be paired with other Regenerator users such as Slowbro to form a solid defensive core that can be very difficult to break through. Rotom-W and Heatran are good partners, as they have fantastic synergy with Amoonguss and beat Talonflame rather well. Amoonguss pairs nicely with slower sweepers if it opts for Stun Spore.

Other Options
########
An Assault Vest set with Foul Play and Clear Smog is an option as it pairs nicely with Regenerator, but it struggles to do much damage and severely misses the ability to use Spore and, to a lesser extent, Stun Spore. Because of this, it is setup fodder for a wider variety of threats than usual. Energy Ball can be used as it has 15 more Base Power than Giga Drain, though it is generally the inferior option, as Amoonguss appreciates the recovery of Giga Drain too much to give it up. Toxic is also an option, but Amoonguss would much rather spread sleep and paralysis, which are much more debilitating statuses and provide more useful support to the rest of the team.

Checks & Counters
########

**Setup Sweepers**: After it has put something to sleep, Amoonguss is setup fodder for a wide variety of Pokemon, especially ones that threaten it initially or are immune to Clear Smog. Scizor can set up on Amoonguss if it lacks Hidden Power Fire or Stun Spore, while Dragonite takes little from Hidden Power Ice thanks to Multiscale and can set up on Amoonguss with Dragon Dance. Fire-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona threaten Amoonguss with their powerful STAB moves, and can also set up on it, although they are crippled by Stun Spore. Reuniclus doesn't mind Stun Spore that much and is able to set up on Amoonguss with Calm Mind and overpower it with STAB Psychic-type moves.

**Strong Fire-, Flying-, Ice-, or Psychic-types**: Amoonguss might be very bulky, but like most Pokemon, it does not take super effective STAB moves very well. Pokemon such as Talonflame, Latios, Heatran, and Kyurem-B can all dent Amoonguss with their respective STAB attacks.

**Steel-types**: Amoonguss has problems beating certain Steel-types. As a Grass / Steel type, Ferrothorn is immune to Spore, Stun Spore, and Sludge Bomb, takes very little from Giga Drain, and is only 3HKOed by uninvested Hidden Power Fire at best. Likewise, it can set up hazards on Amoonguss, mitigating the effectiveness of Regenerator. Forretress is similar in this regard, but it must be more cautious of Hidden Power Fire, and unlike Ferrothorn, it is not immune to Spore unless it has Overcoat. Skarmory fears none of Amoonguss's attacks, including Hidden Power Fire, and can use it as Spikes fodder or hit it hard with Brave Bird, but it too must be cautious of Spore.

**Opposing Grass-types**: In general, opposing Grass-type Pokemon are a problem for Amoonguss, as they are immune to Spore and Amoonguss is not powerful enough to break through very many them, even with super effective attacks. Mega Venusaur in particular is neutral to Sludge Bomb, Hidden Power Fire, and Hidden Power Ice.

**Magic Bounce Pokemon**: Similarly, Magic Bounce Pokemon are immune to Spore and can either hit Amoonguss hard with STAB Psychic-type moves in the case of Espeon and Xatu or set up Swords Dances on it in the case of Mega Absol. Do note, however, that Amoonguss is immune to its own status moves being bounced back at it due to its Grass typing.

**Entry Hazards**: Spikes and Stealth Rock can help in wearing down Amoonguss, as they prevent it from making full use of Regenerator.

**Taunt**: Amoonguss is crippled by Taunt from the likes of Deoxys-D, Deoxys-S, and Sableye. Deoxys-D in particular can set up entry hazards very easily against a Taunted Amoonguss thanks to its huge bulk.

**Clerics**: Heal Bell and Aromatherapy users are able to heal opposing teams of Amoonguss's status spreading in a single turn. Chansey and Blissey in particular laugh at Amoonguss's attacks, and thanks to Natural Cure, can't be crippled by Spore or Stun Spore themselves.
