<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder is successfully infatuated, so is the Pokemon that caused the infatuation. This item is not consumed on use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In-game, infatuation can cause some people to tear their hair out. Luckily for them, Attract and Cute Charm are hardly ever seen in competitive play, due to their gimmicky nature, inability to affect Pokemon of the same gender and genderless Pokemon, and the number of options that outclass them. This makes Destiny Knot's effect next to useless, effectively removing it from competitive play altogether.</p>
