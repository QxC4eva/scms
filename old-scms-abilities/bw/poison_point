30% chance to poison when struck by a contact move.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When a Pokemon connects with a contact move against the wielder, there is a 30% chance of poisoning the enemy. Poison Point has a separate chance of activation on each hit of a contact multi-hit move, and can status a Pokemon multiple times if the first status is removed by the effect of <a href="/bw/items/lum_berry">Lum Berry</a> or similar items. Poison Point is prevented by <a href="/bw/moves/safeguard">Safeguard</a>, but not by <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The two most common users you will see are <a href="/bw/pokemon/nidoqueen">Nidoqueen</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/scolipede">Scolipede</a>. Both set up entry hazards and neither have a better second ability that would complement them, although <a href="/bw/abilities/sheer_force">Sheer Force</a> is a choice for Nidoqueen even though it is a defensively-minded Pokemon. Poison Point can be good in a pinch but usually is just annoying rather than game-changing.</p>
