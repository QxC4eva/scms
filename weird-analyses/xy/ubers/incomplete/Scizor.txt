Overview
########
Generation 6 brought a lot of changes to scizor. Xerneas is a brand new threat that scizor is well-built to check or counter. Furthermore it is very useful to stall teams in that it can check mega-gengar with pursuit and bullet punch. It also has gained a mega-evolution, which is all round a bit bulkier and slightly faster, whilst still being offensively powerful. The increased presence of Ho-oh due to defog removing all hazards, and the birth of Mega-Blaziken are significant drawbacks for it however, as is its loss of dark/ghost resistances. Overall, despite its clear weaknesses, its strong typing and various forms of utility give it a meaningful place in the ubers metagame.


Support

move 1: Bullet Punch
move 2: Roost
move 3: Superpower / U-turn
move 4: Toxic / Defog / Knock Off
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Bullet Punch does at least 54% to bulky Geomancy Xerneas after stealth rock. Roost provides healing and is massively useful. Superpower deals heavy damage to ekiller and Chansey. U-turn can be used when you predict a switch-in that is capable of countering scizor, such as ho-oh, and bringing in a threat to said counter, whilst Toxic is an alternative move to use on switch-ins, and is also useful for stalling pokemon such as support arceus forms. Knock Off not only hits hard but it disrupts the foe's items, which is often incredibly helpful. Defog is a fantastic support move that Mega-Scizor can usually pull off and help the team with. Whilst not mentioned above, Pursuit allows you to deal with mega-gengar reasonably effectively, however the specially defensive spread mentioned below is recommended if pursuit trapping is to be attempted. Sword Dance is usable on this set as well; though it's not designed to be used as a sweeper, it is helpful when trying to pursuit-trap aegilash, abusing it on a predicted king's shield.

Set Details
========

Light Metal is used since when it megavolves it regains technician anyway, and it potentially can reduce the power of low kick's/grass knots that it switches in on, though unlikely. It is also useful when ditto switches in before you're megavolved and leaving it without the boost of technician. It is difficult to bluff a band set with technician since there is such a drop in power, so light metal is generallly the most useful. A spread of 248 HP / 60 Atk / 72 Def / 128 SpD and Impish can be used as an exchange of power for bulk without stopping it being capable of checking xerneas and ekiller. 248 HP / 60 Atk / 200 SpD and Careful is the most reliable set to check Xerneas, 2HKOing Xerneas after stealth rocks, and maximising special bulk; because of the increased special bulk it is also better at trapping Mega-Gengar.

Usage Tips
========

Ideally you give Xerneas prior damage before removing it with bullet punch. Roost, U-turn, Knock Off, and Toxic are useful to use in free turns, and in U-turn's case to generate more of them. Pursuit works best on mega-gengar when you switch in the turn before it's able to megavolve, and then you have to predict around it; the specially defensive spread is the best for doing this. Superpower allows you to check ekiller and chansey, whilst defog should be used in free turns and switch-ins to remove crippling hazards. You want ekiller to be no higher than about 70% HP for Mega-Scizor to reliably handle it.

Team Options
========

For a team relying on it to pursuit-trap mega-gengar, naturally options like chansey deserve greater consideration. Otherwise, it is useful primarily for checking both xerneas and ekiller. As such it does like partners that can put their HP into the regions where scizor can finish them off. Scarf Zekrom pairs nicely as it can take care of Ho-oh and Kyogre, whilst Mega-Scizor checks both ekiller and Xerneas, and they also can form a volt-turn core. Other teammates that can handle fire types and other threats that get a free switch on Scizor, such as Kyogre, are ideal. You should also carry a second check to Geomancy Xerneas since Mega-Gengar is often paired with it, and with destiny bond can take away Scizor, should you be using it to pursuit-trap Mega-Gengar.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Bullet Punch
move 2: Knock Off / Pursuit
move 3: Superpower
move 4: U-turn
ability: Technician
item: Choice Band
evs: 248 HP / 248 Atk / 12 Def
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Bullet Punch allows it to check xerneas; it can 2HKO it, but must beware hidden power Fire. Pursuit allows it to check mega-gengar, but with destiny bond and gengar's powerful attacks it is not a clean counter, and often may forfeit itself in the process. Bullet Punch as a powerful priority attack also makes up for its poor speed and underwhelming bulk. Knock Off is powerful and disruptive, and is its best option versus Ho-oh, as well as threats such as Giratina-O and Aegislash. Superpower allows it to check ekiller, and does heavy damage to chansey, and allows it to threaten steel types who resist its STABs and Knock Off. U-turn is a secondary STAB and is useful in for momentum.

Set Details
========

Choice Band gives it a lot of power. Is a guaranteed 2HKO with bullet punch most Xerneas, as well as with Mega-Gengar. The defensive EVs allow it to not be OHKOed by Jolly LO ekiller with earthquake after a Sword Dance boost, after stealth rock, whilst at full health. 248 HP / 56 Atk / 12 Def / 192 SpD and Careful can take Focus Blast from Xerneas after a Geomancy boost and 2 stealth rocks, and still hits hard. 248 HP Evs reduces stealth rock damage.


Usage Tips
========

Switch it in versus Xerneas and use bullet punch, as well as threatening weakened threats, and revenge killing. The main purpose of CB Scizor is exchanging the bulk of the support set for raw power, leaving a dent in anything it hits. It should however beware of users of Will-o-Wisp, particularly support Arceus forms, as well as pokemon that potentially carry fire-type attacks.

Team Options
========

The best pokemon to pair with it are those which offensively check pokemon that obtain a free switch on it, such as Ho-oh, Kyogre, and Blaziken. Because of this pokemon such as Palkia, Zekrom, and Arceus-Ground pair well with it, able to come in on these pokemon and threaten them. Zekrom can form a volt-turn core with Scizor, whilst Palkia and Arceus-Ground enjoy being able to switch in safely and land a free hit.


Other Options
########

Bug Bite is a stronger bug-type STAB. Tailwind is quite gimmicky, but in combination with U-turn it could be quite powerful, providing sweeping opportunities for teammates. Lum Berry is also an option to soak up a Will-o-Wisp. Assault Vest could be used but the power drop is significant. Baton Pass is an option but suits very few players or teams. Thief deserves a small mention as being consistent and in some situations stronger than Knock Off, for examples against megas such and arceus forms, particularly ghost arceus.


Checks & Counters
########

**Fire types** Ho-oh is a particularly potent threat, although it dislikes knock off and toxic, whilst other fire attack users such as Blaziken and Mega-Charizard-X can set up on it too.

**Physically Bulky Pokemon** Rocky Helmet Skarmory punishes U-Turn spam, and if it doesn't carry defog can set up spikes on it. Aegilash hates knock off, sword dance and pursuit, however is otherwise a solid check. Landorus-T and Gyarados only fear toxic and knock off, whilst gliscor fears nothing and can also taunt it. Mega-Aggron can laugh at anything Scizor tries to do.

**Will-o-Wisp** Support Arceus forms and Giratina can burn it, leaving scizor neutered, but cleric support can remedy this.

**Kyogre** Physically Defensive Kyogre outright doesn't care about scizor, whilst other sets only mind Toxic, Knock off, or U-turn. Specsogre can practically use Water Spout for free.

**Thundurus** It can taunt to stop roost and defog, whilst hitting hard with a strong electric STAB attack, although it dislikes taking too many hits.

**Hazard Setters** Forretress and Klefki don't mind Scizor, and can set up spikes unless it carries defog.

**Fire Attacks**Other fire attack users include Genesect, Palkia, and Dialga, who can use powerful fire attacks to destroy it, although fantastic checks. Hidden Power Fire and Fire Blast from unexpected pokemon, such as Mega-Gengar and Xerneas can really cause it trouble.

**Zekrom** Zekrom can 2HKO but fears toxic and knock off.
