Protects user and allies from multi-target attacks.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user and its party members are protected from damaging attacks made by other Pokemon, including allies, during this turn that target all adjacent foes or all adjacent Pokemon. Does not prevent passive damage such as sandstorm or poison. This attack has a 1/X chance of being successful, where X starts at 1 and doubles each time this move is successfully used. X resets to 1 if this attack fails or if the user's last used move is not Detect, Endure, Protect, Quick Guard, or Wide Guard. If X is 256 or more, this move has a 1/(2^32) chance of being successful. Fails if the user moves last this turn or if this move is already in effect for the user's side. This move has a priority of +3.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Wide Guard has absolutely no use in singles battles. In doubles and triples battles, however, it can protect teammates from multi-target and spread moves such as Earthquake and Surf. A common misconception with this move is that it serves as a Protect for every team member. However, it will only protect against moves that target more than one Pokemon, and will not protect against moves that only target one opponent. Wide Guard can be used in VGC to protect teammates from common multi-target and spread moves. For example, Wide Guard can protect Scizor from the common Heat Waves and Flying-types from Rock Slides.</p>
