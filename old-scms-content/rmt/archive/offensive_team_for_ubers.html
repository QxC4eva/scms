<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>So, I finally reinstall ShoddyBattle and check out the Ubers Leaderboard (haven given up on OU, due my sucking). I've dropped from 5th-ish to 18th in my on-and-off last 3 months; I try out my old bulky-sweeper team and find it is way past it's prime. After fooling around with Maniac's old team (which garners slightly more favourable results) for a good long while, I bring myself to the conclusion that I am need of another new Ubers Team. I decide I want to try something new out; a change of pace from the pseudo-Stall i've been playing. In fact, going as far as to not use the same Groudon/Kyogre (Dual-weather) or Bliss/Lugia combos i'd had used endlessly in the past.</p>

<p>This was to be an offensive team. An experimental one in a few ways, using alot of non-standard templates as well as a few theorymen sets i've had in my head for a while. Based somewhat off one of Articanus' Uber teams, as well as Husk's 'Astral Projection' squad, I found what i was looking for. Screen Support, fast residual setups and do-or-die sweepers.  While this team does have a few 'elements of surprise' it can function reasonably well in repeated battles which is something this team also thrives on. I know this probably doesn't belong in a RMT, but the psychological aspect of this team is also pretty menacing. Designed to get massive pay-offs from very threatening sweepers, this can and has really demoralise a few opponents who now immediately forfeit the match when staring me down (giving me a decent chunk of points in the meantime).</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/389.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Deoxys-S</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Superpower</p>

<p>My lead-off and the rough equivalent to a suicide lead. Has never failed to get Stealth Rocks up. People often expect Mixed Sweeping sets, giving me ample time to set up Spikes as well. Usually, I can get Stealth Rocks and at least one layer of Spikes as Deoxys' defences can usually weather a hit. Superpower is mostly filler but it 2HKOs Darkrai which is something that can get very annoying for this team.
However, I wouldn't mind giving it something to combat those annoying-as-ass Kyogres. They're a major problem to this team, as I'll elaborate upon later. Taunt shuts down other like-minded lead off pokemon.</p>

<p><strong>Bronzong</strong> @ Light Clay<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs:  252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Reflect<br />
- Light Screen<br />
- Hypnosis</p>

<p>Part 2 of the setup. Once entry hazards have been setup and Deoxys-S has fallen, this guy steps in, sleeps something then proceeds to setup Dual Screens, followed by exploding. Also, my main counter to Groudon w/out Fire Punch (which is practically all Groudon, anyway). Max SpDef to handle take one hit from a ScarfOgre and to then, shut it down with Hypnosis. </p>

<p>Very integral to the team as it protecting my fast and now, bulky beasts. Can usually take out at least two pokemon as well, sleeping the first and blowing up on the second. Allows for free-setup and a free switch-in to anyone of the next guys. Since i'm not running Gyro Ball, i've got a 31 IV in Speed to outpace those Forry's who do run Gyro Ball.</p>

<p><strong>Metagross</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Pursuit / Earthquake<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Meteor Mash</p>

<p>My little ace-in-the-whole. When things look rough, Scarf Metagross steps in. Scarf Explosion is another great way to 'clear the field' or just rid myself of something annoying and tanky. Meteor Mash, attack ups make up for the lack of CB most of the time. I rarely see anyone switching it out from Metagross anymore, so Pursuit is becoming a little redundant. Earthquake on the other hand has 100 BP and hits Jirachi and Dialga for SE damage while hitting neutral on Palkia and Kyogre. A solid counter for SD Rayquaza as well.</p>

<p><strong>Rayquaza</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Air Lock<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Extremespeed<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Flamethrower</p>

<p>Bread and Butter sweeper. SD and Extremespeed. Dual Screens protect it from other priority fiends and as well as Lugia's Ice Beam. Sweeps alot of teams on it's own. Not much to explain here.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/248.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>Here's that theorymon sweeper. Standard DD/Taunt Tyranitar, but boy does it work a treat. Taunt neutralises WoW from Giratina and Whirlwind/Reflect from Lugia. Meanwhile their Ice Beams, Dragon Claws, Dragon Pulses or Shadow Claws (lulz) are made ineffective thanks to the SpDef boost and dual-screens. Meanwhile Lum protects me from any unexpected Status effects, which are immediately followed by a Taunt. Only really counter is Groudon and Garchomp whose earthquakes usually bait a Bronzong switch-in. </p>

<p>This can usually grab a total of 2 Dragon Dances, once on the switch to a generic wall like Lugia or Giratina and the second after they've been taunted. Lum also alleviates the likes of Toxic Spikes for a single switch in, and once Tyranitar comes it's unlikely it'll be going until it's a taken a few down with him.</p>

<p><strong>Mewtwo</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Aura Sphere<br />
- Grass Knot<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Fire Blast</p>

<p>Simple but effective. Flamethrower and Grass Knot provide excellent coverage and have roasted quite a few Scizors, Metagrosses and Forretress' in it time. Every other pokemon on this team can setup or annihilate Blissey in a move or two and by the time, I bring this out, it's usually late game and i'm just cleaning up.</p>
