[Overview]
 
<p>Walrein can function without hail support, but it must run an entirely different set. Though its typing gives it weaknesses to Stealth Rock and Fighting-type attacks, Thick Fat grants Walrein resistances to both Ice- and Fire-type attacks, making it a solid special wall. Walrein's bulk is impressive; with 110 / 90 / 90 defenses, it can take resisted hits with ease and fire attacks back off a base 95 Special Attack stat.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite the fall in popularity of hail teams, Walrein is nonetheless amazing because it can switch into any Choice Specs-boosted Ice-, Fire- or Water-type attack and be fine. Encore is a great supporting move, and Walrein makes excellent use of it. Encoring the opponent into a stat-boosting move can give another teammate the opportunity to set up, changing the momentum of the battle. Thus, Encore forces the opponent to use a non-boosted attack or let one of Walrein's teammates set up. Usually, it forces a switch, allowing you to Toxic another opposing Pokemon. Toxic, being essential for stalling, is necessary for a wall such as Walrein. Depending on what coverage is needed for the team, either Surf or Ice Beam can be used. Surf hits Fire-types that Walrein can easily switch into, and also hits Rock / Ground Pokemon that threaten Walrein with super effective Rock-type attacks. Ice Beam demolishes Flying-types, namely Altaria and Swellow, but you have to catch the latter on the switch as Swellow outspeeds and can KO a weakened Walrein with Facade. Protect racks up Toxic damage whereas Roar can be used in conjunction with entry hazards to phaze and deal a little damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Walrein works best as a special wall because its resistances are commonly seen as special attacks, but it can run a physically defensive set if necessary. The EVs for this set maximize its special bulk.</p>

<p>There are several forms of support Walrein appreciates. Using a spinner to rid the field of Stealth Rock is very helpful, but with the few choices available, it might be hard to consistently remove hazards. As Walrein is so weak to hazards, something to remove the opponent's Ghost-type spinblocker could be useful if you do decide to run a Rapid Spin user. Torkoal has decent synergy with Walrein as it can take physical hits well and can spin away said hazards. Skuntank is great at removing pesky spin blockers with Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Pokemon that resist Fighting- and Rock-type attacks also make good teammates; Exeggutor for instance can also take Grass-type attacks aimed at Walrein, while Throh can tank Fighting-type hits.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Walrein has some other unique options that can be viable. Super Fang together with Brine allows Walrein to hit a little harder than usual, but takes up two moveslots. Although Super Fang can be used, Walrein has enough Special Attack to make use of its STAB moves while providing coverage for the team. A physical Curse set is usable and probably one of the better other options Walrein has. If you really need Walrein to function on its own, Icy Rock can be used with Hail and Ice Body, but eight turns of hail really isn't enough to work with, and even with other stalling support, Ice Body isn't that effective.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>It can sometimes be hard for Walrein to be effective due to the widespread use of Stealth Rock, as well as the power and popularity of Fighting-types. If you can get a powerful attacker, such as Cacturne, behind a Substitute without being Encored, Walrein will be forced by the threat of Seed Bomb to switch out. Faster Fighting-types, such as Sawk, can also threaten Walrein with Close Combat. Poison-types are immune to Toxic and can Toxic Walrein in return, hampering its walling capabilities. As mentioned before, Walrein is easily worn down with Stealth Rock, so if you can force it to switch, Walrein will be much less effective. Finally, Taunt from Pokemon such as Misdreavus ruins many of the defensive sets, and usually forces Walrein out, giving your Pokemon time to set up a Substitute or use a boosting move.</p>
