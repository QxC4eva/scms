Overview
########

- Decent offensive typing, but suffers weaknesses to 5 common types on defense.

- Handles the increasingly common Ho-oh nicely, and has a good matchup against Yveltal, Kyurem-W, Fire Pokemon, etc.

- Gets a massive 1.5x Special Defense boost from Sandstorm on top of 120/120/120 base defense stats, and can patch up its "weaker" physical side by burning foes with Will-o-Wisp.

- Able to use Defog effectively, making it useful for clearing hazards (see: all support Arceus formes).

- Demolished by Kyogre, greatly dislikes Mega Mewtwo-X and any of the 5 Arceus forms with advantageous typing against Rock.


Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Defog
move 2: Recover
move 3: Judgment
move 4: Will-O-Wisp
item: Stone Plate
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe

Moves
========

- Judgment provides a reliable, decently powerful STAB move. Handles the numerous flying types in Ubers (read: Ho-Oh) well.

- Recover provides longevity, which is a must on any defog supporter.

- Defog removes hazards and screens, which, by all accounts, is pretty neat.

- Will-O-Wisp messes up the physical attackers that would otherwise prove problematic for this set.


Set Details
========

- Max Speed with a timid nature is amongst the better spreads for support Arceus-Rock, since being outsped by other Arceus formes sucks.

- That said, some lower speed investments can be used to outspeed specific threats and add bulk. Most notably, investing 96 Speed with a positive nature enables Rock Arceus to outrun all Base 100s, 112 zips past Garchomp, and 176 and 184 eclipse base 110s and Thundurus respectively.

- Max HP is self-explanatory. Placing 4 EVs in Defense prevents Genesect from getting an attack boost, and thus gives Arceus-Rock a slim chance to avoid a 2HKO from Iron Head.


Usage Tips
========

- This set's main role is to keep hazards off your field and spread status (usually burn).

- Arceus-Rock is one of the few Pokemon in the tier than can easily switch into either of Ho-Oh's STAB attacks. Be somewhat wary of the fiery turkey, though; Earthquake from a banded set does more than enough to 2HKO.

- Will-O-wisp combined with solid base defenses allows it to serve as an okay check to a number of physical attackers (including some with super effective coverage). This works particularly well against Mega Kangaskhan, as Rock Arceus can handle its Normal STAB with ease (n.b. not the safest switch, Earthquake from Mega Kangaskhan does a solid chunk). Don't rely too much on this capability, though, as a well-placed Lum Berry can result in its demise.

- The presence of Sandstorm allows Arceus-Rock to reach a ridiculously high level of special defense, further increasing its longevity.


Team Options
========

- Having either Tyranitar or Hippowdon on your team can be useful, as Sandstorm's special defense boost is very cool (see above). Rock Arceus shares a multitude of common weaknesses with these teammates, though, so it's not always advisable.

- Since Kyogre flat-out demolishes Arceus-Rock, having a check, such as Assault Vest Palkia, is essential.

- As this set lacks refresh, having a teammate with Aromatherapy or Heal Bell (i.e. Xerneas, Blissey) prevents statuses like Toxic and Burn from wearing down Arceus-Rock over time. Clearing burns from Rock Arceus is particularly useful, given how frequently it ends up switching into Banded/Life Orb Ho-oh. Xerneas also has a handy resistance to the fighting types that plagued Rock Arceus in Gen V, but shares a common weakness to steels.

- Shaymin-S is a pretty good teammate all-around, as it tears through the most of the offensive threats to Arceus-Rock (Ground, Grass, Fighting, Water) while also appreciating the latter's resistances to Flying/Fire and ability to clear Stealth Rock.

- Ho-Oh also covers a wide range of threats to Rock Arceus (although the two share a common weakness to Water) and provides much more bulk than Shaymin-S.


Calm Mind Mono-Attacker
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Judgment
move 3: Recover
move 4: Refresh / Will-O-Wisp
item: Stone Plate
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spe

Moves
========

- Calm Mind, as one might expect, is what makes this set click. After just a couple of boosts, Rock Arceus can handle a good part of the tier with its powerful Special Attack and nigh-on impregnable special defense.

- Judgment serves as an effective STAB move which, notably, has no immunities.

- Recover helps prevent Rock Arceus from getting worn down by chip damage and priority.

- Refresh has a rather self-explanatory role, removing statuses that would otherwise put Rock Arceus on a timer.

- Will-O-Wisp, on the other hand, allows this set to cripple physical attackers, patching its weaker defensive stat (after the Calm Mind boosts, of course).


Set Details
========

- Max HP is what it is (Take more hits => Do more in return => Profit).

- 96+ Speed is the benchmark to outspeed Timid Base 100 opponents, the fastest of the common threats that Rock Arceus can potentially outspeed. Other speed investments can allow Rock Arceus to outspeed various other Pokemon.

- Investing 160 EVs in Defense allows Rock Arceus to patch up the defensive stat which isn't being boosted by Calm Mind / Sandstorm.


Usage Tips
========

- It's very likely that your opponent will have their Rock Arceus checks intact in the early- and mid-game; as such, this set tends to work best when it sets up in the lategame. Don't try to force a setup too early.

- Sets lacking Will-O-Wisp can't stop threats like Groudon or Garchomp from switching in freely and smashing Rock Arceus with an Earthquake, while Toxic and Thunder Wave can cripple sets lacking Refresh. Know your weaknesses and play accordingly.

- Calm Mind Arceus sets with type advantages are often this set's bane -- don't bother continuing to set up against them unless you're at least at +3 on the switch-in. The majority of these threats are checked by Ho-Oh, while Calm Mind Water Arceus will either fear status or physical threats like Choice Scarf Zekrom.


Team Options
========

- Having either Tyranitar or Hippowdon on your team can be useful, as Sandstorm's special defense boost is very cool (see above). Rock Arceus shares a multitude of common weaknesses with these teammates, though, so it's not always advisable.

- Since Kyogre flat-out demolishes Arceus-Rock, having a check, such as Assault Vest Palkia, is essential.

- Shaymin-S and Ho-Oh have very good type synergy.

- Lugia and Giratina cover weaknesses to Fighting and Grass, plus either Ground or Water depending on which of the two is used.


Other Options
########

- Can run a Swords Dance set which tears through numerous opponents (i.e. 252 HP Skarmory after Stealth Rock, Defensive Yveltal) after a single boost, and does a hefty chuck to Giratina and Landorus-T. However, the set faces several problems that can limit its utility. Rock Arceus's porous defensive typing allows it to be easily revenge killed after setting up, burns are increasingly common thanks to this generation's Will-O-Wisp buff, and Stone Edge is unreliable as your only STAB move. On top of that, it faces competition from Arceus-Ground, which can run a nearly identical set and has better accuracy on its STAB.

- Stealth Rock can replace Defog on the support set, particularly if there are other potential Defog users or spinners on your team. It tends to have a higher opportunity cost than Defog, though, and there are plenty of other viable SR users in the metagame.

- Toxic can similarly be used over Will-O-Wisp on the support set, as it takes more of a toll on special setup sweepers. Not having Will-O-Wisp causes some different problems, though, as the set becomes (a) unable to handle many physical threats and (b) complete setup fodder for the tier's many Steel types.


Checks & Counters
########

- **Kyogre**: Quite possibly the single biggest threat to Rock Arceus, Kyogre can win just about every matchup with the fossilized deer. Sets running Choice Scarf / Specs will ohko Rock Arceus with Water Spout and Surf respectively, while defensive variants still do heavy damage and can force out Calm Mind Rock Arceus with Roar.

- **Blissey**: The demonic pink blob has little to fear from any variation of Rock Arceus (barring the obscure SD set) and can cripple it with status moves.

- **Other Water-types**: Water Arceus, Palkia, and yes, even Omastar, can all dish out heavy damage, even if Drizzle isn't brought into play.

- **Fighting-types**: The Fighting-type portion of the Ubers metagame will regularly put Rock Arceus in a world of hurt. Mega Mewtwo-X (thanks to taunt & speed tiers), Blaziken, and Fighting Arceus don't have to worry much about Will-o-Wisp, and will tear holes in the creator's rocky facade. Rock Arceus, on the other hand, can only respond with minimal damage.

- **Ground-types**: Ground Arceus, Groudon, and Garchomp are amongst the more threatening earthen opponents that Rock Arceus faces in the tier, as every one of them can beat down Rock Arceus with Earthquake (or on rare occasions, ground-type Judgment). They're far from perfect checks, though, as most of these pokemon are vulnerable to Will-o-Wisp from Rock Arceus.

**Steel Types**: Dialga resists rock-type Judgement, usually doesn't care much about a burn, and can deal more damage back with either neutral dragon moves or Flash Cannon. Genesect and Scizor can also prove threatening to Rock Arceus at times, although their respective Steel STAB moves fail to net the OHKO, and neither of the armored bugs appreciate Will-o-Wisp.

**Bulky Grass Types**: Grass Arceus beats its rocky cousin through brute force, if nothing else, and other threats like Ferrothorn and Amoongus are easily capable of wearing Rock Arceus down.

**Shaymin-S**: While it cannot switch in on Rock Arceus freely, as Judgement from the support set is an OHKO, Shaymin-S outspeeds the stone titan and deals well over 70% of Rock Arceus' health with Seed Flare, enabling it to revenge-kill the deer with some prior damage.
