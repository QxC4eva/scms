<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This team IS NOT meant to take hits, so don't tell me what it covers and doesn't cover. I am retiring this team and know it's weaknesses very well. It is made for a quick sweep and has done so much for me, this is by far the most fun team I have ever used and I find myself going back to it everytime I use it. Please enjoy.</p>

<p>Saturday night, August 5th. Stone_Cold, Eo Ut Mortus, and TheFourthChaser were in a 3 way call and I was murking niggas and showing them my skills, then out of nowhere we all started singing Reflection from Mulan in Harmony. Now everytime I use this team, I listen to Reflections as I use this and it has gotten me 95% win rate when I use this team in coordination with that song.</p>

<p>I encourage you all to listen to this as you view the team and read my last comments. Please enjoy and without further ado. I asked Andrea aka Godudette on Smogon to sing Reflections for my RMT introduction music and she hesitantly agreed. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-9mb6KJ70">Here you all are</a>. Give her a round of applause.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Politoed</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Drizzle<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Hidden Power Grass<br />
- Perish Song</p>

<p>I have only used one Politoed set ever and this would be it. Specs is strong, but Specs can't pull a sweep like ScarfToed can. ToxicProtect is cool, if you like to stall and want to use a terrible set. This is the set guys, Focus Blast is a piece of shit move and I am removing for hp grass momentarily, fucking Gastrodons ruining my day.</p>

<p><strong>Starmie</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Hidden Power Grass</p>

<p>One of the best rain sweepers I have ever used. Normally OHKO's Scizor cold and obviously has the ability to sweep. However, Rapid Spin is it's main priority as it allows me to help 3 of the 4 following pokemon do their job. While sweeping with Starmie is beneficial and always welcome, it's main purpose is to support this face paced team.</p>

<p><strong>Jolteon</strong> @ Expert Belt<br />
Ability: Volt Absorb<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Baton Pass<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Thunder<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>Underrated. I had Rotom on this team, it was cool. I put Jolteon on this team, I never once looked back. The speed and pure power of Thunder is one of the best feelings. I had magnet on for a while but Ebelt normally allows HP Ice to KO gliscor 100% of the time. Jolteon help prepares Dugtrio for Nintetails, Tyranitar, Jirachi, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Tornadus</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Prankster<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Hurricane<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Rain Dance</p>

<p>Many people ask me, "Stone, what in your opinion is one of the greatest sweepers you have used". My response is: Hurricane on blast. Many of the Frontier brains fell victim to Specs Hurricane early on and it is such a spectacular move. Jirachi's get 3hko'd and Heatran is the only Pokemon I have witnessed who can attempt to tank it and in Rain it's still not doing a heapload. This guy is one of the few reasons I can get quick wins, don't underestimate this guys power.</p>

<p>Guys just ignore dark pulse and focus blast, they serve no purpose and are filler. If im not U-turning, im SPECS HURRICANE ON BLAST. No need for all that other shit. <3</p>

<p><strong>Dugtrio</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Arena Trap<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
IVs: 21 HP<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Reversal</p>

<p>Note: lower the HP IVs so that you have 201 HP for 50 HP Substitutes.

<p>I would like to start this set off by thanking Tobes for such an incredible set. Before this was the main set to use, I was introduced to this on the East World Cup channel by Tobes, as far as I am concerned he created this set and introduced it to BW OU. Please correct me if I am wrong. With the ability to weaken and get rid of some of the biggest threats in the game, there is no reason to even consider moving this guy off this team. I have killed every single weather pokemon in the game w/ this, even Abomasnow. Tornadus and Jolteon set this guy up so perfectly and many times I can get sr off before the intiial kill. By far one of the most fun pokemon I have ever used.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Every battler longs for the incredible feeling of having a set they can call their own. Philip7086 in 2009 created a set that exploded on Smogon and had people in awe. Torment Heatran. Many of us know it today and while I have made a plethora of sets with Philip7086, and have a few I could call my own, this is by far the best pokemon I have ever used on any of my teams. Countless times I have swept, and I have never been more proud to make this guy. It was totally worth it and I am glad I can share it all with you. I have gotten numerous PO pm's and Forum pm's asking for the set and spread so here it is.</p>

<p>Thanks to: Tobes for inspiring this set for me; IFM for inspiring this set for me; Earthworm for helping me finish the ev spread</p>

<p><strong>Dragonite</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Multiscale<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 80 Def / 16 SpD / 160 Spe<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Roost<br />
- Dragon Dance</p>

<p>With the addition of Multiscale, Dragonite is one of the best pokemon in BW OU right now. What many didn't consider at the time of me creating this set a couple months ago was abusing Multiscale with Substitute and Roost. Originally this was jolly nature with 16 speed and the rest in Special Defense but it was proven that Careful nature and 160 speed is more beneficial. With the ability to stall ice beams and hp ices and get the initial set up, I have gotten more pure sweeps with this pokemon then any other pokemon in my entire pokemon career. I see myself all the time simply sacrificing my entire team so I can just set this guy up vs stall teams and sweep. If you have faced this team and haven't lost to this guy, I would be very suprised. This is the reason I play pokemon, theres just sets that can stun you and make you want to use them over and over and this is one of them.</p>
