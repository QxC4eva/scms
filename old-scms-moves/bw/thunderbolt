<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to paralyze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Thunderbolt is the most powerful special Electric-type attack with 100% accuracy, which makes it a staple STAB move on many different Electric-type Pokemon, who typically have high Special Attack. It is also widely available as a Technical Machine, and thus is an extremely common coverage move for many Pokemon. Most notably, it pairs with Ice Beam to form BoltBeam, a two-move combination that covers every Pokemon in the game for at least neutral damage besides Shedinja, Thick Fat Mamoswine, Lightningrod Seaking, Magnezone, Rotom-F, Rotom-H, and Volt Absorb Lanturn. The fact that Thunderbolt has relatively high power for almost no negative side-effects whatsoever only serves to improve its case. Thunderbolt is a move of which to make good use.</p>
