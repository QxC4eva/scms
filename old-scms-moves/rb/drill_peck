<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The best Flying-type move available in RBY, it's often used by Zapdos, Fearow, and Dodrio to deal physical damage. It hits Exeggutor super effectively, something that makes the move worth using. Furthermore, Zapdos's high critical chance makes use of this move, being able to bring down Snorlax and even Reflect Alakazam with some luck. It 3HKOs Chansey and critical hit 2HKOs it easily. In the UU scene, it's useful against Machamp and other Fighting-type friends such as Poliwrath and Primeape, who is not seen much anyways.</p>
