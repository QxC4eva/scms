[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Apicot Berry raises the user's Special Defense by 1 stage once the user is brought down to 1/4 or lower of its HP. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes an 80 Base Power Ground-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Apicot Berry is not quite as powerful an item as Liechi, Salac, or Petaya Berries, which raise attacking stats, as once you are down to 25% of your HP, defensive stats aren't really going to save youâ€”and with an Attack or Speed boost, you may well be able to kill something before going down, or even pull off a sweep.</p>
