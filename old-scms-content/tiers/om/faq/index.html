<p><strong>Q: What exactly is an Other Metagame?</strong></p>
<p>A: Other Metagames are formats created by users that are put through a submission process in which moderators review your idea and then improve upon it and ulitmately approve it. An Other Metagame is basically any format that is not standard, such standard tiers include OU, UU, RU, NU, and LC. Any tier besides that, bar Doubles, is considered an Other Metagame. Some popular metagames include STABmons, Almost Any Ability, and Balanced Hackmons.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Who are the moderators of this subforum?</strong></p>
<p>A: There are currently three moderators of the forum and they are  the Other Metagames leader, <a href="/forums/members/hollywood.144939/">Hollywood</a>, <a href="/forums/members/the-immortal.62285/">
The Immortal</a>, and <a href="/forums/members/the-eevee-general.41805/">The Eevee General</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How long does submissions usually take?</strong></p>
<p>A: The submission process could ranger anywhere from a few hours to around three weeks or so, it all depends on how quickly the moderators get around to it. A good tip is to never PM / VM spam them asking them to check your metagame, it will not make them go quicker; instead, it will annoy them. The one exception to this is if your metagame has had no replies in around a month or so, tagging them in the thread can alert them; keep in mind that they are humans and will occasionally miss things.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How do I vote for Other Metagame of the Month?</strong></p>
<p>A: All OMotM info can be found <a href="/forums/threads/.3481155/">here!</a></p>

<p><strong>Q: What is a Pet Mod?</strong></p>
<p>A: Pet Mods are, quite simply, formats in which mostly custom changes are made. This includes changing the type of specific Pok&eacute;mon, adding new moves, or adding new Pok&eacute;mons, even. These Pet Mods must also be approved by the OM team.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are all Pet Mods Other Metagames? Are all Other Metagames Pet Mods?</strong></p>
<p>A: The answer to the first question is yes, the answer to the second question is no. All Pet Mods are Other Metagames, not all Other Metagames are Pet Mods.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Where do we discuss the metagames?</strong></p>
<p>A: The most relibale way of discussion is by simply posting in the metagame's thread. Keep in mind that this is a forum, so posts may not come that quickly. If you're looking for real-time discussion or answers, check out <a href="play.pokemonshowdown.com/othermetas">the Other Metagames room</a> on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! if you're looking for this! We also have an <a href="http://chat.mibbit.com/?channel=%23othermetas&server=irc.synirc.net">IRC Channel</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Q: What do I submit?</strong></p>
<p>A: Submitting metagames can be a bit tough at first, but there is really no limit on what you can submit! Be sure to check the index beforehand, though, to ensure a metagame has not already been approved. Generally, it's important to remember that the metagame should be a bit simple, so anyone can pick it up and learn it! For more information, check out <a href="/smog/issue38/articlename">this article</a> for more information!</p>

<p><strong>Q: With all these metagames, how do I know what's already been submitted?</strong></p>
<p>A: This is where the <a href="/forums/threads/.3505031/">Index</a> is especially helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are my OM Submissions viewable to everyone?</strong></p>
<p>A:Nope! Your OM Submissions are only viewable by the Other Metagame Moderators, and they don't really have a reason to leak what you post either!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Do I earn anything for participating?</strong></p>
<p>A: There is no "guaranteed" reward for good posting, but it does not go unnoticed. Consistent good activity can also lead to earning a badge. Do note, however, that winning OMotM does not earn you anything but bragging rights.</p>

<p><strong>Q: This metagame is on the sixth page, permission to bump?</strong></p>
<p>A: Short answer: no. Long answer: maybe not. Always check with a moderator and get permission before you bump anything, it's usually against the rules. However, one can bump an old metagame <em>with permission</em> should a metagame or project be deserving.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Where do I play?</strong></p>
<p>A: Sadly, most metagames do not have actual places to be played with and are often left to discussion. A select few metagames, however, do have ladders and are able to be played on <a href="play.pokemonshowdown.com/">Pok&eacute;mon Showdown</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Where do I find sample teams?</strong></p>
<p>A:You can find the sample teams thread <a href="/forums/threads/.3515410/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is a micro-meta?</strong></p>
<p>A: A micro-meta is any metagame in which a total of 50 or under Pok&eacute;mon are allowed to be used in a metagame. You can find out more information <a href="/forums/threads/.3493055/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What's the deal with Hackmons?</strong></p>
<p>A: Both Hackmons and Balanced Hackmons underwent a controversial change that involved the EV limit being changed from 1512 to 510, due to in-game mechanics. This led to a lot of concerns and issues in the community, but eventually things stabilized and were settled down a bit more. Eventually, the Hackmons ladder was entirely removed and was replaced with a challenge-only format called 'Classic Hackmons'. The Hackmons ladder is going to be coming back soon, however.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What's the policy on revamping old metagames?</strong></p>
<p>A: Usually, it will be alright to update BW metagames to better reflect XY. Be sure to get permission from both the moderators and the previous metagame creator, though.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What's the difference between Balanced Hackmons and Hackmons?</strong></p>
<p>A: Balanced Hackmons is, as in the name, more balanced than Hackmons. There are a few bans that include Evasion, Parental Bond, Shadow Tag, Arena Trap, Huge Power, and Pure Power. Hackmons, however, has no ability bans. This is the primary difference between the two, they're quite different despite both having Hackmons in the title!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is the place of discussion for CAP?</strong></p>
<p>A: Nope, CAP is it's own project, hence "Create-A-Pok&eacute;mon Project". The best place for this is the <a href="/forums/forums/.66/">CAP subforum</a> for this.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I have a server, am I allowed to host these?</strong></p>
<p>A: As long as you have permission from the owner, it will be fine! All code can be found <a href="/forums/threads/.3517025/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is the edge on critism and being rude?</strong></p>
<p>A: Think of it like this: if you are being helpful, you're doing it right. Giving <em>constructive</em> criticism is what is being looked for, not someone telling someone else that their metagame idea is horrible. This defeats the whole purpose; plus, bashin on other people can lead to an infraction or ban. You'll most likely know the line, be sure not to cross over too far!</p>

<p><strong>Q: I saw someone make a bad post in the subforum, what do I do?</strong></p>
<p>A: The best course of action in this case is to leave the post alone and not reply to the thread, the moderators will get to it as soon as they possibly can. Just a warning, minimodding is quite frowned upon.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is there an IRC cbhannel?</strong></p>
<p>A: <a href="http://chat.mibbit.com/?channel=%23othermetas&server=irc.synirc.net">Yes!</a></p>

<p><strong>Q: Are there any people who would be able to mentor me in Other Metagames?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes there most certainly are!

Feel free to contact any of them for mentoring and / or any questions that you have regarding Other Metagames!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are there any ladder challenges?</strong></p>
