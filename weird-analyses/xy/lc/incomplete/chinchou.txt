Bulky Attacker
########
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Heal Bell / Soak / Thunder Wave
move 4: Ice Beam / Hidden Power Grass
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Berry Juice / Eviolite
evs: 76 HP / 212 Def / 152 SpA / 60 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is the strongest STAB move
Scald can be used if you prefer 100% accuracy and a burn chance
Volt Switch grabs momentum and provides an electric STAB
Thunderbolt can be used if you prefer a more powerful STAB
Heal Bell allows Chinchou to take advantage of switches and bulk to cure its team of statuses
Soak can be used to force counters to switch out in fear of a STAB Electric attack. It also removes their STAB
Thunder Wave cripples offensive switch-ins such as Misdreavus and is a nice move for slower offensive teams
Ice Beam hits Grass and Dragon types
Hidden Power Grass lures in and hits other Chinchou hard
Heal Bell is incompatible with Soak, so use the combinations of Heal Bell + Ice Beam and Soak + Hidden Power Grass are recommended
Thunderbolt can be used along with Volt Switch if you choose to run Soak should you want more power and not want to switch out, but using it leaves you unable to touch opposing Chinchou

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Chinchou to handle Flying types such as Murkrow and Fletchling better while maintaining power
Volt Absorb grants it an Electric immunity and unreliable recovery
Berry Juice allows Chinchou to take some damage, heal it off, and come back swinging
Eviolite is an option if you'd rather have more bulk in the first place
Modest boosts Chinchou's power
Usage Tips
========

If you aren't sure what will switch in, Volt Switch is great
Luring in Grass types, Ground types, and other Chinchou with the threat of Volt Switch can net surprise KO's with Ice Beam, Hydro Pump, or Hidden Power Grass, respectively, or allow you to go into a counter with Volt Switch
Use the amount of switch in opportunities Chinchou gets and the amount of switches it forces to remove your team of statuses with Heal Bell
Great at bluffing a Scarf before Berry Juice activates
Team Options
========

Other Pokemon with U-turn and Volt Switch that can handle Chinchou's Grass type counters, like Gligar and Vullaby
Pokemon that can handle bulky Normal types, like Mienfoo
Pokemon that can beat Spritzee, like Pawniard
Pokemon that can beat Misdreavus, like Porygon
Pokemon that can take Ground and Grass type attacks, like Murkrow
Sweepers that appreciate a cleric, such as Moxie Scraggy, Misdreavus, and Pawniard
Spritzee who can pass Chinchou wishes
Chinchou can lure in many Pokemon that Meditite can KO or force out, as well as give it a safe switch in

move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Thunderbolt
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 52 Def / 232 SpA / 224 Spe

Moves
========

Volt Switch is gives you momentum and is an easily spammable STAB
Hydro Pump hits hard as your other STAB, coverage Fire types and Ground types, who are immune to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt
Scald can be used if you're willing to give up power for accuracy and a burn chance
Ice Beam rounds out the coverage by hitting Grass types and the lesser seen Dragon types
Thunderbolt is mainly filler, but provides a more powerful Electric and 100% accurate STAB for late game cleaning

Set Details
========

EV's give maximum power and Speed, with an extra point in Defense
Volt Absorb grant Chinchou a very useful immunity to Electric type moves, granting it more switch-ins
Choice Scarf gives Chinchou a boost to its speed, letting it outspeed and OHKO threats like Gligar and Drilbur
Modest gives him as much power as possible, which is needed because of Chinchou's mediocre Special Attack

Usage Tips
========

Frail thanks to the lack of Eviolite and Berry Juice ; won't want to switch in much
Can work as an effective surprise counter to common leads like Gligar
Luring in Ground and Grass types with the threat of Volt Switch can allow Chinchou to dent these Pokemon with its other STAB or Ice Beam, or Volt Switch into a teammate that can handle these Pokemon

Team Options
========

Other Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Larvesta who can take on physical attackers that give Chinchou trouble
Gligar and Vullaby, who can get rid of hazards for Chinchou, take Ground attacks aimed at it, and form a Voltturn core
Fighting types like Mienfoo who enjoy having Gligar gone

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Scald
move 4: Heal Bell / Volt Switch / Discharge
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Eviolite
evs: 76 HP / 132 Def / 228 SpD / 60 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Rest gives Chinchou a way to recover health, something all its other sets lack
Sleep Talk lets you keep attacking or supporting while asleep
Heal Bell can wake you up so you can Rest again or guarantee you will use an attacking move next turn
Volt Switch can be used for coverage, and momentum. Unlike last generation, the sleep counter doesn't reset upon switching, making this a viable option
Discharge can be used if you don't want to switch out
Scald is your primary STAB that also has a nice burn chance
Set Details
========

The EV's are put into Chinchou's bulk, making it harder to remove thanks to having a recovery option
Volt Absorb grants Chinchou an immunity and another way to recover health
Eviolite boosts its bulk even further
Bold helps make up for Chinchou's lower defense stat

Usage Tips
========

Don't be afraid to switch out after Resting thanks to the new sleep mechanics
Think ahead about your opponent's attack. If they've worn you down to where they can knock you into critical range on the next turn, you're usually better of using Rest than attempting to KO them.
Great status absorber
Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate a switch in to Murkrow, like Meditite
Pokemon that can take on Grass types that wall Chinchou, like Ponyta
Flying types, like Gligar who can also beat Timburr and Croagunk
Pokemon that appreciate a Cleric

Other Options
########
Agility can make Chinchou a sweeper, but it is difficult to set-up and lacks the power needed to sweep
Parafusion can be ran, though Murkrow does this better
Chinchou can be a solid Rain Dance setter, and it can abuse Thunder and boosted Hydro Pumps with it up
Toxic can be used to cripple Porygon and Munchlax not running Rest
Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Ferroseed and Snover for 4x damage
