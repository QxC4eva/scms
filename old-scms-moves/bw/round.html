<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. If there are other active Pokemon that chose this move for use this turn, those Pokemon take their turn immediately after the user, in Speed order, and this move's power is 120 for each other user. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Round, the new universal TM, is a giant slouch in the effectiveness department. While it does have the chance to hit incredibly hard in doubles and triples, it serves no use at all over many more powerful attacks in singles battles, with a constantly low 60 Base Power.</p>
