<p>2012 has rolled around, and The Smog is still printing strong. Is printing the right word? I don't even know, but life goes on. Here's hoping you all enjoyed Christmas and New Year's! Well, here we are, back to the same routine. As always, let the show go on!</p>

<p>I must be honest and say that I was a tad disappointed at the number of submissions this time around. In fact, it was so low, that after counting the scores, only two people were eligible for prizes, out of the three available. <a href="/forums/member.php?u=88480">Jalmont</a> and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=57965">Lady Salamence</a> have earned their prize. As always, Mekkah will be happy to set your custom title.</p>

<p>As convoluted as last issue's questions were, the answers aren't as subjective as may seem. As a result, not all questions will be listed, but here is what can be solidly defined to be right or wrong.</p>

<dt>What is meant by Smogon's motto?</dt>
<dd><strong>Nil Sine Pokemon translates as "Nothing without Pokemon."</strong></dd>
</dl>

<p>Sigh. The years have caught up to me. I'm no longer as sharp as I once was. Doesn't mean I can't catch the lot of you out, though! We're back to basics with simple Pokemon, 10 questions, straight up quick-fire. Here we go!</p>

<div style="float: right;"><img src="/media/smog/16/trivia_porygon.png" alt="" /></div>

<ul>
<li>1. Of the trio of Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Flamethrower, which one has the smallest distribution?</li>
<li>2. Ignoring level up, which is the most common evolution method?</li>
<li>3. Name one of the typing combinations new to Black and White.</li>
<li>4. Which legendary trios have been Box Mascots?</li>
<li>5. For evolution from Stage 1 to Stage 2, ignoring non-level up evolutions, what is the mean average evolution level?</li>
<li>6. Name all the Normal/Flying-type Pokemon ever released.</li>
<li>7. Barring the use of Sacred Ash and Pok√©mon Centers, what is the cheapest way you could restore the following party of 6 to full health?
<ul><li>Poisoned and 20/200</li> 
<li>Fainted</li>
<li>Fainted</li>
<li>Paralyzed and 20/300</li> 
<li>Paralyzed and 2/404</li>
<li>Fainted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the next questions, assume all Pokemon are neutral nature, flawless, no item, and have zero EV investment unless stated otherwise. These questions are also theoretical, even if they are impossible in reality.</li>
<li>8. If Tyranitar uses Mean Look as Terrakion uses Agility, if Terrakion tries to U-turn next turn, would Tyranitar's incoming Pursuit hit before or after?</li>
<li>9. If Gliscor uses Agility, but then Baton Passes to a Jolly Venonat as the opposing Choice Scarf Vanillite Bulldoze hits and triggers, who will be faster on the next turn?</li>
<li>10. What would happen if Wobbuffet used Conversion to become Steel-type as the opponent switches in Magnezone?</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck, one and all! Remember, it's "Issue (X) Trivia", directed to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=32443">The Smog</a>.</p>
