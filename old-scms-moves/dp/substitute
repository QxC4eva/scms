Takes 1/4 the user's max HP to create a Substitute that takes damage for the user.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Takes 1/4 the user's max HP to create a Substitute that takes damage and blocks non-damaging moves until it's broken or the user switches. If Substitute "blocks" something, it means that if a Substitute is up, whatever is blocked will fail if targeted at the Pokémon behind the Substitute. Unless specifically noted, all moves work normally when used by a Pokémon that has a Substitute up.</p>

<p>Other Pokemon cannot inflict status upon a Pokemon behind a Substitute. Synchronize can still inflict status on a Substituted Pokémon. Doom Desire and Future Sight do damage to the Substitute. All other end-of-turn damage is done to the Pokémon, not the Substitute. Substitute blocks flinching.</p>

<p>Substitute blocks Acupressure, Block, Ghost's Curse, Dream Eater, Embargo, Gastro Acid, Grudge, Heal Block, Leech Seed, Lock-On, Mean Look, Mimic, Mind Reader, Nightmare, Pain Split, Psycho Shift, Spider Web, Sketch, Switcheroo, Trick, Worry Seed, and Yawn.</p>

<p>If Yawn is used on a Pokémon who then uses Substitute, however, it will still go to sleep.</p>

<p>Substitute does not block Attract, Destiny Bond, Disable, Encore, Foresight, Guard Swap, Haze, Heart Swap, Imprison, Miracle Eye, Odor Sleuth, Perish Song, Power Swap, Psych Up, Roar, Role Play, Skill Swap, Spite, Taunt, Torment, Transform, or Whirlwind.</p>

<p>Electric-type moves (including Thunder Wave) used against a Pokémon with Volt Absorb and Substitute up will heal the Pokémon behind the Substitute. The same is true for Flash Fire, Motor Drive, and Water Absorb when the Pokémon behind the Substitute is targeted with the appropriate type of attack. Will-O-Wisp activates Flash Fire through a Substitute. Present damages the Substitute if it rolls damage, but heals the Pokémon if it rolls healing.</p>

<p>Rage does not boost Attack when a Substitute is hit.</p>

<p>If a Pokémon has a Substitute up and switches or U-turns out, the Substitute will take the damage from Pursuit.</p>

<p>Moves that leech damage still leech when used on a Substitute.</p>

<p>If a multi-hit move breaks the Substitute, successive hits will damage the Pokémon that was formerly behind the Substitute.</p>

<p>When Baton Passed, Substitute keeps its HP but uses the types and defenses of the new Pokémon. The Substitute does not take damage from Spikes or Stealth Rock; the Pokémon receiving the Substitute does. Baton Passing a Substitute prevents Toxic Spikes from Poisoning the recipient.</p>

<p>Partial-trapping moves (Bind, Clamp, Fire Spin, Magma Storm, Sand Tomb, Whirlpool, and Wrap) do their single-hit damage, but do not do any end-of-turn damage, nor do they trap for 2-5 turns.</p>

<p>Damage due to a Pokémon hitting itself in its confusion goes straight to the Pokémon, not to the Substitute. Recoil goes to the user, not the Substitute. Substitute blocks both the stat boost and the confusion of Flatter and Swagger.</p>

<p>Pokémon cannot Counter, Metal Burst, or Mirror Coat damage done to Substitutes. Pokémon cannot store energy via Bide with damage done to a Substitute. Pokémon can reflect moves with Magic Coat while behind a Substitute, even if the move would fail on the Substitute. Avalanche and Revenge are not boosted if the Substitute takes damage but the Pokémon does not.</p>

<p>Life Orb's 10% max HP recoil does not activate when attacking a Substitute, but the 30% damage boost does. Enigma Berry, Jaboca Berry, and Rowap Berry do not activate on a Substituted Pokémon. Confusion-inducing berries heal, but do not induce confusion on a Substituted Pokémon.</p>

<p>Endeavor does damage based on the HP of the Pokémon behind the Substitute, not the remaining HP of the Substitute. Super Fang does damage based on the Pokémon's HP, not the Substitute's. False Swipe can break Substitutes.</p>

<p>Substitute blocks the item-removing aspect of Knock Off. Substitute does not block the secondary effects of Rapid Spin. SmellingSalt does not get double power against, nor does it cure the paralysis of a paralyzed Pokémon behind a Substitute. Wake-Up Slap does not get double power against, nor does it cure the sleep of a sleeping Pokémon behind a Substitute.</p>

<p>Substitute blocks Intimidate, but aside from that, all abilities ignore Substitute completely.</p>

<p>The effect of this move is Baton Passable. The recipient does not lose 25% of its HP.</p>
