Overview
########

Rotom-W, thanks to its typing, ability, decent stats, and movepool that suits it perfectly, is one of the best utility Pokemon in the tier. It's Water / Electric typing is very useful for taking in powerful and common threats in the tier such as Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Azumarill. Levitate in conjunction with its Water typing allows it to check common Ground-types as well, such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and even non-Substitute Garchomp. Furthermore, it has the perfect support moves to fit its role, with STAB Volt Switch providing ever-valuable momentum, Pain Split healing it and also damaging the opponent, Trick to cripple walls (most notably Chansey, a common switch-in to Rotom-W), and Will-O-Wisp to threaten physical attackers.

Unfortunately, it is Rotom-W's strengths that have made the metagame adapt around it. Teams that use Rotom-W to check the previously mentioned Pokemon will often find that it's hard-pressed to cover them all considering its only recovery move is Pain Split or the one-time-use Rest. However, with even the slightest amount of support, Rotom-W can truly shine in this metagame.

Defensive
########
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Pain Split / Rest
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers / Chesto Berry
nature: Bold
evs: 248 HP / 216 Def / 44 Spe

Moves
========

This set is the perfect combination of defensive and offensive presence, making it a perfect Pokemon for balanced teams. Rotom-W has access to STAB Volt Switch, which allows it to assume the role of defensive pivot against Pokemon like Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Azumarill. This means that even if the opponent has a Latias, mega Pinsir, or other counter in the wings, Rotom-W can simply Volt Switch into another Pokemon that has a better match up against said counter. Hydro Pump is useful for hitting the Ground-types Rotom can usually switch into with ease, namely Hippowdon and Landorus-T. Neither of these Pokemon can take a Hydro Pump well, nor will they appreciate a burn courtesy of Will-O-Wisp. The threat of Will-O-Wisp can also force certain Physical attackers to switch. This includes Bisharp, Garchomp, Azumarill, and other Pokemon on the revenge kill. The last move is dedicated to healing Rotom-W as best it can. Pain Split is useful because it allows it to also run leftovers, gradually increasing its recovery throughout the match. It also "damages" the opponent if they switch in something like Chansey or Mega Venusaur and Rotom-W is at mid or low health. However, Rest has its merits as well. If Rotom-W gets statused, Rest is useful for healing it. Rest also completely heals Rotom-W, while pain Split is dependent on the opponent's health. However, Rest is unreliable, as it can only be used once without putting Rotom-W to sleep. Thunder Wave can be used over Will-O-Wisp, but it is usually an inferior option, as common switch-ins to Rotom-W, such as Latias, Quagsire, Chansey, and Mega Venusaur dislike burn more than paralysis.

Set Details
========

The 44 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed and KO Jolly Belly Drum Azumarill. A physically defensive set is best suited to the metagame, and makes it easier for Rotom-W to counter powerful Flying-types such as Mega Pinsir and Talonflame. However, if your team already has answers to these Pokemon, a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 216 SpD / 44 Spe can be used to better handle Pokemon such as Greninja and Landorus-I, which can both beat the physically defensive set. If using this spread, a Calm nature is advisable. A spread of 248 HP / 80 Def / 136 SAtk / 44 Spe with a Modest Nature still counters Talonflame, while being able to 2HKO specially defensive Heatran with Hydro Pump.

Usage Tips
========

Rotom-W has a great typing and ability that give it many useful resistances. Because if this, it is one of the best defensive pivots in the game. However, there tends to be a lot of defensive pressure on Rotom-W, as many people expect it to check Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Azumarill, Garchomp, Mamoswine, and other Pokemon all at once. for this reason, it's important to realize that it is simply not possible to do all these things, so the rest of the team should try and support it with at least some of these. Rotom-W forces a lot of switches, so the option to either Volt Switch or Will-O-Wisp can be tricky. Don't be afraid to use Will-O-Wisp instead of Volt Switch, as only Pokemon like Charizard X can safely switch into a Rotom-W who might Volt Switch or Will-O-Wisp.

Team Options
========

Rotom-W is one of the best users of Volt Switch in the tier, so common users of U-turn also tend to work well with it. Scizor and Landorus-T are among the best partners for Rotom-W. Scizor in particular covers Rotom-W's weaknesses well, and Mega Scizor loves to set up on common switchins to Rotom-W such as Latios, Latias, and Mega Venusaur. Pokemon weak to Mamoswine, such as Dragonite and Garchomp really appreciate having Rotom-W, as it is nearly a perfect counter to Mamoswine, bar Freeze Dry. Also Pokemon that don't appreciate Mega Pinsir love having Rotom-W as a partner. Offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo and defensive Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur are both good options. Frrothorn is a Grass type, can somewhat handle things like Greninja and Manaphy, and can set up hazards for VoltTurn teams.
