<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When Diamond and Pearl were released, many people were livid  that the cards from their precious EX-on format of nearly 15 sets large  were all suddenly rendered illegal and worthless. The fact that the sets  were not mergable meant that everyone was suddenly limited to no more  than 130 cards. However, the sets soon grew and a whole bunch of new and  amazing cards were released. I'm not exaggerating here; DP-on has cards  that people would have killed for in older sets. Combine the amazing  list of cards with all new gameplay mechanics, and DP-on can quite  possibly be called one of the most interesting formats.</p>

<p>Until later on in September, when the new format rolls along,  these are the current sets in print that are allowed in DP-on  play:</p>

<ul>
<li>H/S Unleashed</li>
<li>Heart Gold / Soul Silver</li>
<li>Arceus</li>
<li>Supreme Victors</li>
<li>Rising Rivals</li>
<li>Platinum</li>
<li>Stormfront</li>
<li>Legends Awakened</li>
<li>Majestic Dawn</li>
<li>Great Encounters</li>
<li>Secret Wonders</li>
<li>Mysterious Treasures</li>
<li>Diamond and Pearl</li>
</ul>

<p>In September when H/S Undaunted is released, Great Encounters,  Secret Wonders, Mysterious Treasures and Diamond and Pearl will be  removed from the format. But that's a story for another time.</p>

<h2>What's New?</h2>

<p>There have been a variety of changes from EX-on to DP-on. Delta  Species and multi-typed Pokémon have taken the boot, there are new  card-types, and the rules have once again been edited. Most of the rules  are largely the same: your deck has to be 60 cards, one supporter per  turn, 4 card limit of non-Basic Energy cards, same old stuff. When it  comes to playing, that's when things get a little different. At the  start of a battle, the first player cannot evolve or play trainers on  their first turn (1A:0B), but the second player can play trainers on  their first turn (1A:1B). Neither can evolve at this stage without Rare  Candy, however.</p>

<p>And there are now two new card types. The first is Pokémon  Level X. These are stronger versions of a normal Pokémon, and they only  come in variants for fully evolved Pokémon. They are played on top of  the regular Pokémon (so you put Empoleon Lv. X on top of your Empoleon,  like evolution), and can only be played onto your Active Pokémon. It is  not classed as evolution, and you cannot Level Up a Pokémon as soon as  you evolve it. So if you had Empoleon that you evolved that turn, you  can't put Empoleon Lv. X on it. If you already had Empoleon but it's on  your bench, you can't put Empoleon Lv. X on it. Pokémon Level X are  usually extremely powerful, with high power, low-cost attacks, high HP  and usually great PokéPowers/PokéBodies. They can also use any  attacks/PokéPowers/PokéBodies printed on their previous card. Think of  them as extensions rather than evolutions. The only cost is that they're  a lot harder to play. Since Pokémon Level X have the same name as their  regular counterparts, you can't have 4 of each. For example, you can  have x2 Empoleon and x2 Empoleon Lv. X, but you can't have x4 Empoleon  and 2 Empoleon Lv. X.</p>

<p>The second new card type is Pokémon SP, meaning Special  Pokémon. These are Pokémon owned by other people, and they will always  have a symbol after their name, depending on who owns them. There are  five classifications: <img src="/media/smog/11/tcg_g.png" alt="G"  /> (Galactic), <img src="/media/smog/11/tcg_gl.png" alt="GL" />  (Gym Leader), <img src="/media/smog/11/tcg_4.png" alt="4" />  (Elite Four&mdash;it uses the Japanese character for '4', so just  use the English character when talking about them), <img  src="/media/smog/11/tcg_c.png" alt="C" /> (Champion), and <img  src="/media/smog/11/tcg_fb.png" alt="FB" /> (Frontier Brain). Since  these guys have different names (due to the character), you can have x4  Crobat and x4 Crobat <img src="/media/smog/11/tcg_g.png" alt="G"  /> in your deck. However, the Level X rule still applies. You can  have x2 Dialga, x2 Dialga Lv. X, x2 Dialga <img  src="/media/smog/11/tcg_g.png" alt="G" />, and x2 Dialga <img  src="/media/smog/11/tcg_g.png" alt="G" /> Lv. X, but no more. Also,  since they have different names, you can't evolve Turtwig <img  src="/media/smog/11/tcg_gl.png" alt="GL" /> into a regular Grotle.  You also can't evolve Nosepass into Probopass <img  src="/media/smog/11/tcg_g.png" alt="G" /> for a different  reason&mdash;all Pokémon SP are Basic Pokémon. That's right, fully  evolved Pokémon as Basics. The cost is that they aren't as powerful as  their fully evolved counterparts, but being Basic and having high HP,  they are essentially the Haymakers of DP-on. Let's not forget that  Pokémon SP have their own special line of Trainer cards and Supporter  cards that work only for Pokémon SP. And these techs are usually  extremely good and better than their non-specialized counterparts (for  example, SP Energy is Rainbow Energy without the damage-inflicting  effect).</p>

<p>There are many types of decks you can use in DP-on, since it's  extremely varied in options, and anything goes, really. Due to their  ability to get going extremely quickly, as well as having their own set  of special support cards, SPs are one of the most popular deck  archetypes to use. Thanks to cards like Team Galactic's Invention  (henceforth referred to as TGI), Energy Gain and TGI SP Radar, most SP  decks can get going within the first or second turn. However, there are a  variety of decks out there that also function effectively which aren't  SP. Other common decks are Grass-typed beat downs, relying on Cherrim's  damage boost and Shaymin Lv. X's HP boost to one-shot the foe, and  Psychic- and Dark-type decks that specialize in control, lockdown, and  disruption.</p>

<h3>SP Decks</h3>
<p>Pokémon SP are notorious for setting up extremely quickly. This  is because there are a variety of cards dedicated to SP support  entirely, such as the TGI cards, as well as the Elite Four's support  cards. As well as this, being all Basic Pokémon, they can be searched  out quickly by a larger variety of cards, such as Roseanne's Research  and the large range of Call for Family attacks. Many of the Pokémon SP  have extremely useful PokéPowers and can still hold their own in battle.  However, the main force behind Pokémon SP decks are the Level X  Pokémon. Pokémon SP Lv. X are extremely easy to play (since Pokémon SP  are all Basic) and they have extremely low-cost, high-power attacks.  They are extremely powerful from the get-go, especially as most other  decks take a bit longer to fully set-up.</p>

<h3>Grass Aggro</h3>
<p>Grass-types have two very distinct advantages. The first is  Shaymin Lv. X, who can boost the HP of all other Grass-type Pokémon by  40. This is actually an extremely large difference, and can even affect  whole battles. In a pinch, Shaymin's attack also lets it attatch Energy  to your Pokémon, thus quickening your setup. The second card is Cherrim.  Cherrim boosts the damage of all your Grass-type Pokémon by 10. While  this doesn't seem like much, the PokéBody stacks, meaning you can have  three Cherrim in play doing an extra 30 damage&mdash;that's the  equivalent of a Stage 1's weakness modifier. When you consider this  stacks on top of other modifiers like PlusPower, Expert Belt, and the  opponent's Weakness and Resistance, the extra damage really is helpful,  especially on weaker attackers like Scizor. On top of this, "swarming"  is a very popular tactic, which involves having multiple cards on the  bench to power up your own attacks. The best example is Jumpluff, whose  damage potential is extremely high, and set-up speed rivals that of SP  decks, making it one of the most ferocious deck styles in  play.</p>

<p>Notable cards: <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/platinum/126-shaymin-lv.x.jpg">Shaymin  Lv. X</a>, <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/stormfront/14-cherrim.jpg">Cherrim</a>,  <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/heartgold-and-soulsilver/6-jumpluff.jpg">Jumpluff</a>,  <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/stormfront/25-scizor.jpg">Scizor</a>,  <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/supreme-victors/14-yanmega.jpg">Yanmega</a>,  <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/arceus/10-tangrowth.jpg">Tangrowth</a></p>

<h3>PsychoDark Control</h3>
<p>Many of the Psychic- and Dark-type Pokémon fit the constant  stereotype quite well. Instead of relying on brute force, many of their  PokéPowers and attacks have side effecs that bind the opponent into  being unable to attack, which is where they will wait until the prey is  sufficiently weakened enough to be picked off. Control varies between  the likes of Disruption and Lock. Disruption is the use of PokéPowers  and Supporters to slow the opponent from setting up while you set up  yourself at average speed, while Lock is the use of PokéBodies and  Attacks to stop your opponent from even playing any of the cards they  need. Both are extremely effective and also extremely annoying for the  opponent, and this is what makes them so effective. As your opponent  struggles with their few remaining options, you can capitalize on any  mistakes they make. As well as this, the option of running fast donking  (KOing the opponent's Active when they have nothing left on the bench,  winning the game) options like Ambipom <img  src="/media/smog/11/tcg_g.png" alt="G" /> or Shuppet makes these  types of deck even faster and even more dangerous from turn 1.  </p>

<h2>Good Cards</h2>
<p>Aside from the cards mentioned earlier in deck-styles, there  are a few other cards that do well in the metagame, but are either not  good enough to be a deck style on their own, or fit into such a large  variety of decks that they can't be summarized. There are two types  here. The first section will talk about universally good cards that can  fit into virtually any deck, and really should be used in every deck.  The second section will cover interesting cards with good potential  synergy and combos with other cards that aren't good enough on their  own.</p>

<h3>Staple Cards</h3>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/great-encounters/102-rare-candy.jpg">Rare  Candy</a></strong><br />
<em>Trainer &ndash; Choose 1 of your Basic Pokémon in play. If  you have a Stage 1 or Stage 2 card that evolves from that Pokémon in  your hand, put that card on the Basic Pokémon. (This counts as evolving  that Pokémon.) (If you choose a Stage 2 Pokémon in your hand, put that  Pokémon on the Basic Pokémon instead of on a Stage 1  Pokémon.</em></p>

<p>Lets you evolve straight from Basic to Stage 2. Invaluable for  the decks that rely on the high power attacks or PokéPowers of Stage 2  Evolutions. It also lets you evolve the Basic the same turn you played  it. An extremely useful tool, especially since you can play multiple  ones in a single turn.</p>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/secret-wonders/125-roseanne%27s-research.jpg">Roseanne's  Research</a></strong><br />
<em>Supporter &ndash; Search your deck for up to 2 in any  combination of Basic Pokémon and Basic Energy cards, show them to your  opponent, and put them into your hand. Shuffle your deck  afterward.</em></>

<p>This card lets you find Basic Pokémon, or Basic Energy. This is  actually incredibly helpful, since it can either help you set up  early-game by pulling your Basics and then Rare Candying them, or later  on&mdash;when you're short on Energy you can play this and grab two  you need. Since nearly every deck runs Energy and Basics, this is almost  necessary for any deck: not just for the early-game advantage it gives,  but for late-game support too.</p>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/stormfront/86-luxury-ball.jpg">Luxury  Ball</a></strong><br />
<em>Trainer &ndash; Search your deck for a Pokémon (excluding  Pokémon LV.X), show it to your opponent, and put it into your hand.  Shuffle your deck afterward. If any Luxury Ball is in your discard pile,  you can't play this card.</em></p>

<p>This is the best searching card in print. You can search your  deck for nearly anything you need, provided it isn't Level X. Plus it's  not even a Supporter, so you can play something else in the same turn.  The only set back? Once you've used one, you can't use another, so most  people only tend to run one copy in their decks. Of course, having more  means you're more likely to draw one, but if you can't use them, what's  the point?</p>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/platinum/104-broken-time-space.jpg">Broken  Time-Space</a></strong><br />
<em>Stadium &ndash; Each player may evolve a Pokémon that he  or she just played or evolved during that turn.</em></p>

<p>If you lack Rare Candy, or if you only need Stage 1 attackers,  you'll still need to get them in play as fast as possible. This card is  extremely useful since it can get your Basic up to a Stage 2 in one  turn. Be wary though, since your opponent can also use this effect, and  they might set up faster as well. As well as that, this card doesn't let  you place a Level X from your hand on top the Stage 2 you just evolved.  Evolving and Levelling Up are two different effects.</p>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/rising-rivals/89-bebe%27s-search.jpg">Bebe's  Search</a></strong><br />
<em>Supporter &ndash; Choose a card from your hand and put it  on top of your deck. Search your deck for a Pokémon, show it to your  opponent, and put it into your hand. Shuffle your deck afterward. (If  this is the only card in your hand, you can't play this  card.</em></p>

<p>This is another Supporter that comes in extremely handy both  early on and in the late-game. You can trade any one card in your hand  for another Pokémon in your deck. This is especially helpful if you need  to grab a certain Pokémon, since you can take anything, even if it's a  Level X. Extremely useful in all situations&mdash;the only thing  worth worrying about is that it's a Supporter, so it might be a bit slow  if you're in a losing situation.</p>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/arceus/87-expert-belt.jpg">Expert  Belt</a></strong><br />
<em>Pokémon Tool &ndash; The Pokémon this card is attached to  gets +20 HP and that Pokémon's attacks do 20 more damage to your  opponent's Active Pokémon (before applying Weakness and Resistance).  When the Pokémon this card is attached to is Knocked Out, your opponent  takes 1 more Prize card.)</em></p>

<p>Instantly bolstering any Pokémon's HP by 20 is helpful. This  not only takes most things out of KO range for common attackers, but on  some HP dependant attacks, it lets you overpower most other attackers  and KO them with more ease. Also, you boost the power of all your  attacks by 20. This overcomes the resistance on some Pokémon, as well as  adding that extra power so you can KO other things too.</p>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/legends-awakened/43-uxie.jpg">Uxie</a></strong></br  />
<em><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_psychic.png" alt="[P]" />  &ndash; 70 HP / W: P+20 / R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &ndash; RC: <img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]"  /><br />
PokéPower &ndash; Set Up: Once during your turn, when you put Uxie  from your hand onto your Bench, you may draw cards until you have 7  cards in your hand.)<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" />  &ndash; Psychic Restore (20): You may put Uxie and all cards  attached to it on the bottom of your deck in any order.</em>
Uxie may appear weak, and it is. Being easily KOed by most common  attacks, and not having much of an attack of its own. But this attack is  actually extremely handy. It can use any Energy, so fits into any deck,  and and it does 20 damage. This more often than not is the small  threshold which scores and prevents KOes. It essentially nullifies any  Expert Belt they may have had. As well as that, you can put Uxie back  into your deck for reuse later. And you definitely want to reuse it  because its PokéPower lets you draw until you have 7 cards in your hand.  At times when you have a small hand, this card can be a godsend, and  quite literally, turn the whole battle around.

<h3>Archetype Candidates</h3>
<p>And of course, with every game, there are those cards that can  be extremely good with the right support, but just don't see enough  competitive level play to be seriously considerable for a deck. They'll  do when you play with friends and the like, or anything non-competitive,  just don't expect to win all the time with these, if at all. It's also  worth mentioning a lot of these cards are better off being thrown into  decks as a side-filler rather than trying to have a whole deck dedicated  to them.</p>

<h4>Feraligatr (Prime) [HeartGold and SoulSilver]</h4>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/heartgold-and-soulsilver/108-feraligatr.jpg">Feraligatr</a></strong><br  />
<em><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" />  &ndash; 140 HP &ndash; W: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_grass.png" alt="[G]" />x2 &ndash;  R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; RC: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><br />
PokéPower &ndash; Rain Dance: As often as you like during your turn  (before your attack), you may attach a <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" /> Energy card from your  hand to 1 of your <img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]"  /> Pokémon. This power can't be used if Feraligatr is affected by a  Special Condition.)<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" /> &ndash; Hydro  Crunch (60+): Does 60 damage plus 10 more damage for each damage counter  on the Defending Pokémon.</em></p>

<p>Feraligatr works with a wide range of Pokémon &ndash; it  can get any Stage 2 Water-type ready for action the turn it's played  thanks to Rain Dance, and when you consider some of the more powerful  attacks that belong to the Water-types of TCG, such as <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/unleashed/17-kingdra.jpg">Kingdra</a>'s  Steam Pump, <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/unleashed/13-blastoise.jpg">Blastoise</a>'s  Hydro Launcher, or Feraligatr's own Hydro Crunch. Unfortunately, there  are two factors limiting Feraligatr's usefulness. The first is that it  is a Stage 2, which makes it hard to pull as a tech, especially as the  main heavy attacker is also a Stage 2 Pokémon, and the second is that in  order to really abuse Rain Dance, you need to have lots of Water Energy  in your hand. This not only takes up precious deck space that could be  used for other cards, but it also means you have to run certain other  trainers to search out multiple Energy, or to draw lots of cards at  once, again, wasting deck space. Feraligatr is a seriously powerful  tool, but must be used carefully.</p>

<h4>Typhlosion (Prime) [HeartGold and SoulSilver]</h4>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/heartgold-and-soulsilver/110-typhlosion.jpg">Typhlosion</a></strong><br  />
<em><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fire.png" alt="[R]" />  &ndash; 140 HP &ndash; W: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" />x2 &ndash;  R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; RC: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><br />
PokéPower &ndash; Afterburner: Once during your turn (before your  attack), you may search your discard pile for a <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fire.png" alt="[R]" /> Energy card and attach  it to 1 of your Pokémon. If you do, put 1 damage counter on that  Pokémon. This power can't be used if Typhlosion is affected by a Special  Condition.)<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fire.png" alt="[R]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fire.png" alt="[R]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /> &ndash; Flare  Destroy (70): Discard an Energy card attached to Typhlosion and discard  an Energy card attached to the defending Pokémon.</em></p>

<p>Typhlosion's PokéPower is a lot more helpful than you think.  Many, many Fire-types in the TCG often have an attack that involves  discarding an Energy (most of the time, a Fire Energy at that), so what  better way to keep them cycling than with Afterburner? Even Typhlosion's  attack makes use of it, and several other powerful attackers can as  well, such as <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/arceus/98-salamence-lv.x.jpg">Salamence  Lv. X</a>, <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/arceus/1-charizard.jpg">Charizard</a>,  or <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/unleashed/90-entei-and-raikou-legend.jpg">Entei  and</a> <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/unleashed/91-entei-and-raikou-legend.jpg">Raikou  LEGEND</a>. The biggest problem with Typhlosion is of course the  fact that you take damage each time you use it, so chances are, you're  going to die faster than you can abuse the Energy cycling. Of course,  you can attempt to offset that with cards like Moomoo Milk and Super  Scoop Up, but they aren't the most reliable things to attempt due to  coin flipping.</p>

<h4>Gyarados [Stormfront]</h4>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/stormfront/19-gyarados.jpg">Gyarados</a></strong><br  />
<em><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" />  &ndash; 130 HP &ndash; W: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_lightning.png" alt="[L]" />+30 &ndash; R:  <img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" />-20  &ndash; RC: <img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]"  /><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]"  /><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]"  /><br />
<img src="/media/smog/11/tcg_none.png" alt="None" /> Tail Revenge  (30x): Does 30 damage times the number of Magikarp in your discard  pile.<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /> &ndash; Wreak  Havoc (40): Flip a coin until you get tails. For each heads, discard  the top card from your opponent's deck.<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /> &ndash;  Dragon Beat (100): Flip a coin. If heads, discard an Energy card from  each of your opponent's Pokémon.</em></p>

<p>Gyarados's first attack seems silly. It's a no-cost attack that  does 30 damage for each Magikarp in the discard, but there are  definitely some reliable ways of getting Magikarp in the discard without  giving up Prizes to the opponent. Cards like Felicity's Drawing and  Regice can get rid of unnecessary cards in your hand while still having  nice side effects, making Gyarados a 90 damage attacker for zero cost.  Throw in an Expert Belt and several recovery cards and Gyarados can  become a fearsome attacker with almost zero chance of failure. However,  the biggest problem with Gyarados is that the deck has to be very  focused on getting rid of those Magikarp, and then keeping Gyarados  alive during your onslaught. This relies primarily on Trainer and  Supporter cards, and against the extremely common PsychoDark Control,  Gyarados will have a hard time setting up, and a hard time recovering  from the lock.</p>

<h4>Donphan (Prime) [HeartGold and SoulSilver]</h4>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/heartgold-and-soulsilver/107-donphan.jpg">Donphan</a></strong><br  />
<em><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" />  &ndash; 120 HP &ndash; W: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" />x2 &ndash; R:  <img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_lightning.png" alt="[L]" />-20  &ndash; RC: <img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]"  /><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]"  /><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]"  /><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]"  /><br />
PokéBody &ndash; Exoskeleton: Any damage done to Donphan by attacks  is reduced by 20 (after applying Weakness and Resistance).<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" />  &ndash; Earthquake (60): This attack does 10 damage to each of your  Benched Pokémon. (Don't apply Weakness and Resistance for Benched  Pokémon.)<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" /> &ndash; Heavy  Impact (90)</em></p>

<p>Donphan is the epitome of hard donking (to instantly KO their  Pokémon and win in one turn). With a 60 damage for one Fighting Energy  attack, it can get going on your first turn and start winning instantly.  It's a Stage 1, so is easier to play, and its side effect of doing 10  to your entire bench isn't that distraught, especially if you combine it  with other Donphan (so they're immune to each other), and <a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/rising-rivals/30-nidoqueen.jpg">Nidoqueen</a>  to reduce the damage. Donphan's problems? It's got a heavy weakness to  Water, which means it's vulnerable to Gyarados, Feraligatr decks, and  the odd Palkia <img src="/media/smog/11/tcg_g.png" alt="G" /> SP  deck. Also, there's the high cost of retreating and using other attacks,  as well as its Fighting-type, which makes it resisted by a lot of  common decks. Thus, Donphan isn't realistically going to dish as much  damage as it should, and throwing all your eggs into a single basket  like Donphan is a horrible idea.</p>

<h4>Gengar [Stormfront]</h4>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/stormfront/18-gengar.jpg">Gengar</a></strong><br  />
<em><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_psychic.png" alt="[P]" />  &ndash; 110 HP &ndash; W: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_darkness.png" alt="[D]" />+30 &ndash; R:  <img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" />-20  &ndash; RC:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
PokéPower &ndash; Fainting Spell: Once during your opponent's turn,  if Gengar would be Knocked Out by damage from an attack, you may flip a  coin. If heads, the Defending Pokémon is Knocked Out.<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_psychic.png" alt="[P]" /> &ndash;  Shadow Room: Put 3 damage counters on 1 of your opponent's Pokémon. If  that Pokémon has any PokéPowers, put 6 damage counters on that Pokémon  instead.<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_psychic.png" alt="[P]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /> &ndash;  Poltergeist (30x): Look at your opponent's hand. This attack does 30  damage times the number of Trainer, Supporter, and Stadium cards in your  opponent's hand.</em></p>

<p>Gengar is an extremely annoying Pokémon to face. Not only does  it have insurance on the off chance you do get an KO on it before it  KOes you, but its attacks are enough to strike any big attacker where it  hurts. Cards like Spiritomb that lock your opponent's Trainers in their  hand will get seriously hurt by Poltergeist. Shadow Room is also  extremely handy for KOing the likes of Uxie or Azelf if you can drop a  Crobat <img src="/media/smog/11/tcg_g.png" alt="G" /> somewhere. I  mentioned it in the notable cards section of PsychoDark control because  it functions best there, but it can function just fine by  itself.</p>

<h4>Heatran Lv. X [Stormfront]</h4>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/stormfront/97-heatran-lv.x.jpg">Heatran  Lv. X</a></strong><br />
<em><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fire.png" alt="[R]" />  &ndash; 120 HP &ndash; W: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" />x2 &ndash;  R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; RC: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><br />
PokéPower &ndash; Heat Wave: Once at the end of your turn, if  Heatran is on your Bench, you may use this power. If you discarded Basic  Energy cards attached to your <img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fire.png"  alt="[R]" /> or <img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_metal.png" alt="[M]"  /> Active Pokémon by that Pokémon's attack this turn, attach up to 2  of those Energy cards to that Pokémon.)</em></p>

<p>A lot of Fire-type Pokémon have extremely powerful attacks that  involve the discarding of Energy. Some Metal-types like Jirachi can  even discard for extremely powerful effects. While it can take a while  to get going, since you need to send out a Heatran and then get it to  Lv. X and then retreat it back to your main attacker, it's extremely  powerful and can keep a cycle of high-damage power going nearly  infinitely. Cards like Magmortar or Ho-Oh that discard for sniping  damage and extremely high damage, respectively, are great for putting  the hurt down. The only thing to worry about is the setting up, so you  may find yourself throwing in more support for retreating than you  think.</p>

<h4>Machamp [Stormfront]</h4>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/stormfront/20-machamp.jpg">Machamp</a></strong><br  />
<em><img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" />  &ndash; 130 HP &ndash; W: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_psychic.png" alt="[P]" />+30 &ndash;  R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; RC: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" />  &ndash; Take Out (40): If the Defending Pokémon isn't an Evolved  Pokémon, that Pokémon is Knocked Out instead of damaged by this  attack.<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /> &ndash;  Hurricane Punch (30x): Flip 4 coins. This attack does 30 damage times  the number of heads.<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /> &ndash; Rage  (60+): Does 60 damage plus 10 more damage for each damage counter on  Machamp.</em></p>

<p>Machamp is an extremely powerful attacker. Its main attack  costs only <img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" />  and can instantly KO the opponent if they aren't an Evolved Pokémon.  Considering cards like Broken Time-Space and Rare Candy can get him out  by Turn 2, he's going to seriously cause problems for your opponent's  deck. SP decks or decks that rely on Spiritomb or Sableye will suddenly  see their main attacker KOed without Machamp's player even sweating.  However, against any well-played PsychoDark control, Machamp can be KOed  in a single attack, so keep your options open anyway.</p>

<h4>Lanturn (Prime) [Unleashed]</h4>

<p><strong><a  href="http://pokebeach.com/scans/unleashed/86-lanturn.jpg">Lanturn</a></strong><br  />
<em>110 HP &ndash; W: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_fighting.png" alt="[F]" />x2 &ndash;  R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; RC: <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><br />
PokéPower &ndash; Underwater Dive: Once during your turn (before  your attack), you may use this power. Lanturn's type is <img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_water.png" alt="[W]" /> until the end of your  turn. This power can't be used if Lanturn is affected by a special  condition.<br />
<img src="/media/smog/10/tcg_lightning.png" alt="[L]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /><img  src="/media/smog/10/tcg_colorless.png" alt="[C]" /> &ndash;  Powerful Spark (40+): Does 40 damage plus 10 damage for each Energy  attached to all of your Pokémon.</em></p>

<p>Cards like Feraligatr Prime and Shaymin Lv. X can accelerate  your Energy levels to sky-high levels. Combine this with Lanturn's low  Energy cost and extremely high damage output as the Energy stacks and  you are looking at an extremely powerful threat. It can even change its  typing to bypass resistance. It works with Double Colorless Energy, and  DCE still gives it the boost it needs, since it works off Energy units  as opposed to Energy cards. It should be noted, however, that the  Fighting-type weakness is actually a lot more damage that it sounds,  since things like Machamp and Donphan can instantly destroy it in a  single hit.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>DP-on is one of the largest metagames in the Pokémon TCG to  date. It's also extremely versatile. As I said, while not everything is  going to be usable at a competitive level, nearly anything can be used  and put into a deck for some result, and it's always quite fun to play  for fun with friends just to try out something odd. Especially on  Smogon&mdash;unless you're playing in a tournament, people will  usually be okay with taking it easy on you just so you can mess around  with whatever it is you're trying. As well as that, they'll be forgiving  enough to let you go back on a mistake, so you can really see how the  deck does.</p>
