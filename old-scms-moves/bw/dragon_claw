<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Dragon Claw is the bread and butter physical Dragon-type move. While significantly weaker than Outrage, it has the advantage of not locking the user into a rampage of 2 or 3 turns, and as such is a superior option if such a thing is undesirable. On some Pokemon, such as Dragonite and Garchomp, occasionally some battlers will run both Dragon Claw and Outrage despite the redundancy, since there are so many advantages to using both.</p>
