<p><strong>Internet Relay Chat</strong> is a group chat protocol that has been in use by the Pokémon community for at least seven years. Smogon maintains this tradition by having established a channel, or a room of people online, named <em>#pokemon</em> on the <a href="http://www.synirc.net/">synIRC</a> IRC network.</p>

<p>Most of Smogon's culture originates from IRC. You may find that as a result, the nature of #pokemon can be a bit more cliquish than the <a href="/forums/">forums</a>. It's <strong>strongly recommended</strong> to peruse the <a href="rules">rules</a> of the channel and lurk a tad before jumping head first into conversation. If you're looking for primarily Pokémon-related chat, drop by #pokemon, while it also represents the social side of the community, it is the game that has united us that takes precedence.</p>
