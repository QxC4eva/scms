Overview
########
- One of the most threatening Pokemon in the tier.
- Sits at a nice 101 Speed tier to outspeed both Mega Charizards, Mega Medicham, Manaphy and others.
- Has access to two great abilities that suit it well.
- Able to go either physical or special.
- Forms amazing cores with Pokemon like Keldeo, Charizard Y and Thundurus.
- Weak to Ice, which means it's hard pairing it with something like Garchomp.
- Has a tiny bit of 4MSS.
- Hidden Power nerf hurt Landorus somewhat.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Earth Power
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Sludge Wave / Stealth Rock / Rock Slide
ability: Sheer Force
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Earth Power is a ridiculously strong STAB.
- Psychic hits Mega Venusaur, Rotom-W, Zapdos, Gliscor, and Landorus-T for 2HKOs.
- Focus Blast is for the OHKO on Tyranitar, hitting Balloon Heatran and Skarmory.
- Sludge Wave is good for taking out Clefable.
- Stealth Rock is a useful utility option if your team doesn't have it already.
Rock Slide is a cool choice to beat normal checks such as Specially Defensive Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y.
- U-turn can be used alongside a Pursuit user to trap Latios and Latias as well as Chansey, which all are common switch-ins to Landorus.

Set Details
========
- A spread of 48 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe with a Modest nature can be used to outspeed Jolly (Mega-)Gyarados and 216 speed Kyurem-B.
- Use Timid if you use Rock Slide, as it makes an excellent revenge killer for Mega Charizard Y with it. The power drop doesn't matter as Mega Charizard Y is 4x weak to Rock Slide.
- Modest should be used only if your team can handle both Mega Charizards reasonably well, but it adds a lot of power to Landorus' moves.

Usage Tips
========
- This Landorus set should primarily be used to blow holes in stall.
- Use it in the early game to make it easier for another special wall to sweep.
- Appreciates Pursuit trappers, so that Landorus can lure in Latias or Chansey and then KO them the following turn with Bisharp, Tyranitar, or Aegislash.

Team Options
========
- Powerful special attackers like Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Nasty Plot Thundurus work well with it.
- Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp, Aegislash, and Tyranitar are also good partners.
- Pokemon to deal with faster threats such as Garchomp, Keldeo, and Greninja are all necessary. Azumarill can handle several of them.

Setup Sweeper
########
name: Setup Sweeper
move 1: Calm Mind / Rock Polish
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Sludge Wave / Focus Blast
ability: Sheer Force
item: Life Orb
nature: Modest
evs: 48 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe

Moves
========
- Calm Mind or Rock Polish depending on whether beating offense or stall is more important.
- Earth Power is the STAB move of choice.
- Psychic KOs Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss.
- Sludge Wave is useful for hitting Rotom-W, Latias, Latios, and Clefable.
- Focus Blast scores a OHKO on Mega Tyranitar and Mega Gyarados, and hits Rotom-W harder than Sludge Wave.

Set Details
========
- 208 Speed EVs lets Landorus outspeed Jolly Mega Gyarados and OHKO with Focus Blast.
- If using Rock Polish, you will also outspeed every common Scarf user at +2.
- A faster spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe Timid is viable, but Landorus usually appreciates the extra power more.

Usage Tips
========
- This set, unlike the first one, should be used almost exclusively in the late-game.
- Still works really well with Pursuit trappers. Bring it out mid game or lure in a special wall and Pursuit trap it so Landorus can sweep in the late-game.
- Can actually live one Aqua Jet from Azumarill and KO at +1, so don't be too worried about KOing it before trying to sweep.

Team Options
========
- Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus all make great partners because they wear down special walls and sponges.
- Pursuit trappers help eliminate Landorus' counters.
- Works well as a cleaner/win condition for hyper offense teams, so Deoxys-S or Deoxys-D work well with it.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Superpower / Hidden Power Ice
ability: Sand Force
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Earthquake hits very hard off of 125 Attack.
- Stone Edge forms EdgeQuake and hits Flying types that are immune to EQ.
- U-turn is important for grabbing momentum on predicted switches.
- Superpower is useful for revenge killing Mega Gyarados at +1.
- Hidden Power Ice can hit Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor on the switch for 2HKOs.

Set Details
========
- An Adamant nature can be used due to how uncommon Scarf base 100s are, but you will be outsped by Scarf Excadrill and Jolly +1 Mega Charizard X.
- Expert Belt can be used to bluff the Scarf, which can help lure in Lando/Gliscor and nail them with HP Ice.

Usage Tips
========
- This set is mainly used for momentum.
- Also works well as a revenge killer for Mega Charizard X, Dragonite, and Mega Gyarados.
- Use Earthquake sparingly, since it is easy to switch in and set up on.
- Can be a good cleaner once all Ground resists/immunities are gone.
- Appreciates hazards since it causes a lot of switches, especially with other VoltTurners.

Team Options
========
- Tyranitar or Hippowdon are really nice to boost Earthquake and Stone Edge with Sand Force.
- Works best on VoltTurn teams, so Rotom-W, and Scizor are good partners.
- Special setup sweepers that enjoy being able to switch in for free on physical walls appreciate its U-turn; Calm Mind Keldeo and Manaphy fit this role well.

Other Options
########
- Swords Dance
- Gravity
- Double Dance sets can work, but usually done better by Landorus-T.
- Scarf Special set, but it misses the power from Life Orb.

Checks & Counters
########
- Depends on the moveset.
- Latias and Latios are good common counters, but are easily Pursuit trapped.
- Mega Charizard-Y and Special Defense Talonflame can switch into any move bar Rock Slide and Psychic and KO.
- Skarmory, Hippowdon, Ferrothorn take on physical Landorus easily.
- Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Slowbro can take on Scarf Landorus, but they have to watch out for a coverage move (or U-turn).
- Mamoswine and Weavile can stop any set with priority, Banded Azumarill can pick off weakened ones.
- Fast Water types such as Greninja and Keldeo can revenge kill with Hydro Pump or Scald.
