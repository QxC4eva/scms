<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Special Attack by three stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The capability to raise a Pokemon's Special Attack by three stages in a single turn is stellar, no matter how you look at it. Every recipient of Tail Glow loves itâ€”all two of them. Although Manaphy doesn't see much use in Ubers, its Tail Glow set was a large reason behind its ban from OU in both DPP and BW. Volbeat's lone competitive niche comes from Tail Glow alongside Baton Pass and Prankster. With all three moves at its disposal, Volbeat can pass a quick boost to a special attacker such as Gengar, Lucario, or Hydreigon, and have said recipient devastate your opponent's team.</p>
