<div id="interview">

<div class="aside"><p>I look down the street again, waiting for my interviewee. BKC told me he'd be at the intersection near the Battling 101 staff building, but he was slightly late. Eventually, I see him appear on the horizon. A couple seconds later, he sits down on a little ledge, resting on the wall behind him. He dumps his duffel bag near him, and nods at me to start.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Hello, BKC, and thanks for doing this interview! Care to tell us a bit on how you obtained the leadership role of The Indie Scooters?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Hi! It's my pleasure. I played for the Scooters in SPL 3 and 4, and after last season didn't go so well, and the fact that Atticus wasn't going to manage anymore, I decided to try my hand at it.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>How's that worked out for you?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>BKC stares at me for a bit, a small frown on his face.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>The first four weeks... Not so well. But if the midseason overhaul and Week 5 are anything to go by, I think we're turning it around.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Care to go into more detail about this team overhaul?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Basically, the lineup and roster we had clearly weren't working out. Me, august, bro fist, and a few of the players discussed what to do at length, and we all agreed that the current roster wasn't going to work out, so we needed to more or less start over. We had less cash than I'd have liked going into midseason due to my failed upbid on kael in the auction as well. So we started off by selling two inactive players for 3k apiece.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Who were those?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Ace Emerald and Ray Jay. Both are great guys but just had time constraints that didn't let them contribute too much.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p> BKC hands me a picture, which I make out to be the Indie Scooter headquarters, where two plaques are hung up in memoriam of the two ex-Scooters who were removed.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Masterclass deserves a lot of credit. A lot of people dismissed him prior to the auction as a "cancer who isn't even that good at Pok&eacute;mon" but he has been kicking ass and he hatched most of the plans that got us our players in midseason.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>My eyes widen in surprise. Masterclass? Really? I decided to just take BKC's word for it.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Glad Masterclass is working out for you! Any similar stories of steals who have benefited you greatly?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Yeah. We ended up trading ]V[ajinTupacZ to the Cryos for Vinc2612 and 8K, which was a great deal for us. Majin is a really good dude and obviously an amazing ADV player but this deal got us an excellent BW OUer as well as a lot of cash to blow. Most of the new guys really pulled their weight in their debut week, which I was very happy about.</p>

<p>I also couldn't believe we got undisputed for a mere 3K. I wanted him from the start but I didn't think it was all that realistic with the other teams who had a lot of money who could just upbid the hell out of me. He won his first game.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>As I check my notes, BKC laughs, clearly happy with what happened with undisputed.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>The last one was Braverius. When we got him, we basically had everyone we wanted, were waiting for our last two bids (Hack He Must and SnowCristal!) to become official, and we only had 2.5K left, meaning we couldn't draft any more players. Suddenly locopoke, who had been yanking my chain about trading for Veteran In Love, offers me Braverius in exchange for cash. I gave him the useless remaining 2.5K and got who I'm told is the best Doubles player.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Or was he laughing about getting Braverius? I didn't bother asking.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Glad to hear so many things went well during the midseason week!! Seeing as your auction strategies didn't go as well, what do you think you did wrong, and what would you do different?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>I think I was a little too eager to upbid and took some unnecessary risks. I'd probably be more cautious if I were to do it again.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Meanwhile, Lonelyness was an amazing upbidder, upbidding the likes of Bloo and Mizuhime. What were your thoughts on the other manager's plans during the auction?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>As BKC's face turns into a scowl, and he opens his mouth to answer, his focus is quickly refocused to someone in the background, and he gives a small nod. I turn around just to see a flash of a red tail disappearing into the darkness before BKC begins answering.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>We also got a ton of other guys who I'm very happy to have but haven't mentioned yet and would hate to leave out, including Triangles, Nails, cbt, Lohgock, and fitzy72. Great guys and great players.</p>

<p>As for other managers... I don't think the Bloo upbid was exactly fair, since LN somehow "forgot" how to properly write out a bid, and that cost the Ruiners 5K more than they should have spent, which left McMeghan struggling near the end of the auction. However, the other managers did do a rather solid job at disrupting other teams' plans.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I put away that sticky note, as that was the final question on that page. The next page has a completely different topic, and I mentally punch myself for not segwaying into them properly.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Are there any teams you're worried about in upcoming weeks?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>I'm not really worried, per se. I think we're capable of beating any team in the league if we play right, but we're also obviously capable of losing to anyone if we get complacent and lazy. I will say that the Classiest are looking quite strong though, I think that will be our hardest matchup. It'll be in week 9 too, so assuming we're still in the running at that point (and I'm confident we will be) it's going to be very intense.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>You seem confident, best of luck!</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>BKC nods, and quickly spends a couple seconds responding to a text message, motioning I should wait a second.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>What do you think of the pre-SPL drama&mdash;specifically, the tier lineup, and the accusations thrown around of trying to create dynasties?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Thanks! I think the tiers are fine. I voted for LC and Doubles, after all, and blarajan hasn't stopped sucking my dick in gratitude about it yet. There are some things annoying about LC like all the Speed ties but I don't mind it all that much, especially since two broken things just got banned (don't remember which two things, I'd assume one of them was Swirlix or whatever that thing that uses Belly Drum and shit is). I think it was Eo who had the idea of making the tier level 10 or level 15 or something that reduces the ridiculous amount of ties that are inevitable at level 5, so there's that.</p>

<p>Same goes with Doubles. I played VGC for a bit but disliked it intensely, I prefer the 6-on-6 action of doubles a lot and it's actually quite fun to play.</p></div>


<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Interesting. What about dynasties&mdash;good, bad, what?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>There were times in the history of Major League Baseball where people complained about the Yankees being too strong and that's the kind of complaint I'm seeing here. I personally don't mind them at all, since to me it just seems like a petty way to try and weaken other teams; it's not like they're unbeatable, after all. Just because your team, or even any of the other teams, can't beat them doesn't mean they're unfair to the rest of the league. This sort of ties into the mass retentions that were being complained about this year, but those don't always work out...</p>

<p>The Wolfpack, for example, retained a ton of players in an effort to repeat their success from last year. However, even though they're in second place at the time of this interview, you can't chalk that up solely to retained players, as FLCL and Marth are both 1-4. They've got SilentVerse and DracoMalfoy who are 5-0 and 3-2, respectively, but they've also got new guys such as Danilo and aim stepping their game up, even after Donkey quit on them.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>A hiss from a passerby quickly causes BKC to backtrack and add that he means no disrespect, and is just stating facts.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>OK, let's switch gears here, and talk about something I've not done yet in an interview. I'm curious about your opinions on some users who have been in the spotlight at some point during this SPL, both new bloods, and veterans.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Alright.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Let's start with the drama kings: Laurel, WhiteQueen, and Masterclass.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>BKC chuckles when I mention the names.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>In what order should I answer these?</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Let's do the order I listed them in.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Laurel is not the complete trash player he is made out to be. He is ganged up on a lot, sometimes unfairly, but very often he brings it upon himself. He's a nice guy who just is what most people would call a tryhard. I think he's going to help the Wolfpack out honestly, you won't find many people more dedicated to helping than him.</p>

<p>WhiteQueen has come up with an interesting new gimmick this year. Pre-season he did his usual "I'm the best BW UUer ever *insert accomplishments here* and I'm better than kokoloko so draft me" routine, but after he brought his trademark hail week 1 and got smashed by Ginku's CB Heracross, he's been sitting on the bench and has been crying about a counterteam ever since.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>That's a new gimmick?.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Yeah. I don't think bitching about a so-called "counterteam" was in his repertoire before.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Huh. I clearly don't pay enough attention to WhiteQueen's posts.
</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I realize the stupidity of my statement too late, as BKC has already continued.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Masterclass has been the best team player I could have asked for. A lot of people give him shit for having a short temper and being a cancer after last SPL but I've been friends with him for a while (as has bro fist, and august was on good terms with him as well if I'm not mistaken) and he is an excellent pok&eacute;moner so I figured it would work out. He has helped everyone on the team, he's won battles, he's a hilarious guy in the channel... sometimes he trolls me about Mizuhime a bit too much but overall he has been the dude I'm most glad I got.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Three more users. Pwnemon, cbt, and DICE.
</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>I don't know much about Pwnemon. He talked a fuckton in battles despite not being on an SPL team before the tyrannical rule of Eo Ut Mortus decided that modchat was a good idea instead of banning idiots on the Smogtours PS server but that didn't really bother me much and now he's on a team so it's all well and good.</p>

<p>cbt was helping out all season. We were struggling in NU for those first four weeks and then noticed he was 4-0 in Farm League, plus he deserved a spot on a team for his hard work, so we incorporated him into our midseason plan, got him for 3k despite everyone knowing we were going to do it, and he won his first battle. Great buy.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Aside some other thoughts, a "sure guy, whatever you say" comes to mind.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Dice... he's one of my best friends on Smogon and I'm glad we got him. He doesn't like XY Ubers but he put up with it for 4 weeks (even if he did complain about it, he still played, and went 2-2). There was obviously the now-infamous Smeargoth monstrosity vs Blim that was one of the worst failed counterteams I've ever seen but once we convinced him to stop using gimmicks, he used a total of 5 actual Uber pok&eacute;mon against LUST, played great and won. Even though we had a pretty big fight recently due to both of us being stubborn idiots, I'm glad I got him. I don't think he should have been punished at all for what he did, since it was a mistake and not malicious in the slightest (not to mention it had about 0 impact on the battle) but I'm just glad we had the ban cut down to a couple weeks instead of for the rest of the season.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Moving away from some more dramatic users / good Scooterers, midseason has already given us a fairly clear list of who's who when it comes to winning Pokémon matches.
</p>

<p>Specifically, Golden Sun, blarajan, SilentVerse, Colchonero, Fakes, Marshall.Law, and Furai. Any of those surprise you?
</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>SilentVerse and Colchonero, actually. I know they're up there with the best in RU and GSC, respectively but with the hype around Golden Sun and blarajan's records, I just assumed that they had lost once or twice or everyone would be talking about it. Fakes is excellent in DPP and I think he really showed his stuff this SPL, as well as his recent Tour performance. Marshall is just as good. Furai surprised a lot of people with his undefeated record mainly because Furai is more well known for his overt affection for animals, as opposed to his battling ability.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>So he's behind the Red Panda Plague?
</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>I wouldn't know; send a detailed private message to users: Nails and Windsong.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I express my distaste of the animal, BKC less so.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Meanwhile, reyscarface and MarceloDK occupy the other end of the listing. Is this surprising?
</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>I don't think 0-5 is really indicative of how good rey is, being the most recent Frontier winner and all. I remember week 1 in particular he was extremely unlucky against Halloween. He's been surprisingly good-natured about it though. I think he'll turn it around this this week&mdash;Week 6, of which he hasn't played when this interview was done.</p>

<p>As for MarceloDK... MarceloDK talks a lot of trash, and clearly can't back it up. I can't say I expected any different. He's been benched in favor of Eo... God bless.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Faintly in the distance, we can hear choice insults being thrown around.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Someone's clearly running out of options...
</p>

<p>Now it's time for big elephant in the room (not literally, of course, please don't kill me!)&mdash;Mizuhime?
</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>BKC stares at me for a second, before leaning back against the wall and putting his duffel bag on his lap.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>What exactly is it you would like to know about The Exeggutor?</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>How did you guys meet and become such good friends, to the point you kept getting upbid by Lonelyness because he knew you'd bid for her?
</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>BKC's eye's tighten, and I wonder what is going on in his mind.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>I remember in early 2013 I was showing off my brand new rateyourmusic account so I could brag about my superior taste in #pok&eacute;mon and this guy named Eggy was like "nice taste dude" or some shit. So we ended up talking and I found out he was on the forums as The Exeggutor. So later in July I was talking about music in #pok&eacute;mon with RODAN, B-Lulz, and some others. Eggy chimes in with this ridiculous opinion on the latest R.A. the Rugged Man album (something about Hopsin's verse on it being good? Which is ridiculous since I like Hopsin but his feature was weak) so I said something to the effect of "dude are you high" and then about 10 people are like "dude eggy's a girl" which was pretty surprising.</p>

<p>We started talking a lot and eventually she started making me to watch her play Doubles. After groaning a lot about shitty tiers and contracting AIDS, I gave in and it was relatively entertaining because she kept getting haxed and it was hilarious. She forced me to play a game by giving me this hail team that she apparently raped the ladder with and it was actually a pretty fun meta. She had shown she could definitely play pok&eacute;mon, not just Doubles (because we played in DPP once and she fucking haxed me UGH), so I was thinking because I was going to take over the Scooters I could use her in the event that Doubles was added, which was looking likely.</p>

<p>It was kind of known that we were friends and Smogon girls have always held a special place in LonelyNess' heart so it was kind of expected that I was going to get the hell upbid out of me. Definitely worth it though because she rules, is a great team player (she has said "put me anywhere you need me, faggot" numerous times), and won a couple games. Plus she ghosts me in my irl relationships and her advice never fails there it's fucking unbelievable.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Have you ever considered meeting up with her in real life at any point?
</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>BKC seems taken aback for a second, and quickly recovers. He leans forward, and I notice the stub of what looks like a month-long bus pass in his pocket.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>I haven't considered it at all. She lives right outside of Detroit so she'd probably have some gang of hers kill me for the times I laughed at her getting haxed on ladder.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>What if she came to where you lived?
</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>BKC notices me looking at his pocket, and tucks it into his pocket before crossing his leg and repositioning the bag.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>She'd probably bring her gang with her. It's not safe for attractive females to travel alone throughout the dangerous lands of the U S of A.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Attractive? You speak from experience?
</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>Define experience.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>The ability to say that, and back up your claims.
</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>BKC tries to understand what I said while I try to figure out what he's hiding under the duffel bag.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>All I will say is that had other managers seen what she looks like, they would've paid way more than 14K for her on that alone.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>14k on an image? Someone failed economics. OK. Choose: You meet Mizuhime, but you never get any badges or trophies, or you get all the badges trophies you have and/or had, but you never meet Mizuhime.
</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>You clearly haven't seen her! Uh... Is that even a question? Second option, obviously...</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>BKC pauses for a second, and I hear the distinct noise of a blade being sharpened in a nearby bush.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>...is absolutely the wrong choice to make.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Behind BKC, a flash of light catches my eye. From behind a wall, someone was trying to get my attention... with a knife, waving it around menacingly. A flash a blond hair quickly affirms my suspicion, and I no longer feel safe. Fearing for my health, and wanting to leave BKC and whatever he was hiding alone, I start to wrap up, despite wanting to ask him some more questions.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>One final question before we wrap up: you can choose to replace one user on your team who a: has done battles and b: does not have a negative score, with someone else currently in SPL. Who do you replace with who?
</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>I'd probably trade Dice to the Cryos in exchange for dragonuser. I love the princess but he and yondie hate each other which would be hilarious and dragonuser is my favoriteuser.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>You're an evil person.
</p></div>

<div class="speaker bkc"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_bkc.png" alt="bkc" /><p>I try to do justice to my DER Fvkking Tr00 and Kvlt Grymm and Frostbitten Pure Unholy Hateful Raw Nekro Krieg Elitist æonic Br00tal Wrathful Hyperspeed Inverted Icecold Wintry Deutsch Norwegian Transylvanian Pagan Diabolikal Anti-Cosmic Orcish Wolfen Bestial Heretical Genocidal Homicidal Suicidal Medieval Nihilistic Mysanthropik Blasphemic Apocalyptic Hellfired Nationalist-Socialist Antisemitick Holocaustic Panzerkrieg Dunkel Diabolikal Goat-Worshipping Fistfvkking Christraping Soul-crushing Deathworshipping Skullfucking Thelemic Orthodox Germansk Hedensk Satanisk Hellnorsk Arysk Svarte Mörk Blækk Fvkking Goatpenis Mætalle OV DAATH!
