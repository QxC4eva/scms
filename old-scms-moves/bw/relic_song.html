<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to put the target to sleep. If used by Meloetta, causes it to change from Aria Forme to Pirouette Forme and vice versa. The Pirouette Forme reverts to Aria Forme when Meloetta is not active. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune. Pokemon with the abilities Insomnia or Vital Spirit cannot be put to sleep but will take damage as normal.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Relic Song is Meloetta's signature move, and there is only one reason Meloetta would ever bother with this move, and that is to switch Meloetta into the superior Pirouette Forme. As Meloetta-P packs a better Attack and Speed, as well as better coverage, Relic Song is used to switch Meloetta into this forme, as it is the only way to do so. If you're going to utilize Meloetta-A, do not bother with this move, as not only will it switch Meloetta's formes, it is highly inferior to Hyper Voice, which is considerably stronger.</p>
