<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/205.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Forretress</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Sassy Nature<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Toxic Spikes / Pain Split<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Toxic</p>

<p>I used to hate this guy in OU, since well, I never could get it to work, but after using it in Ubers I could never go back. Dragon resistant, it finds quite a few opportunities to switch in and get a layer of Spikes / Spin. Toxic Spikes aren't vital to the team, but they help against quite a lot of offensive teams that rely on dealing a lot of damage in a short time, effectively shortening their lifespan, while Pain Split helps vs standard Giratina. Toxic is to avoid it to become complete set up fodder for Extremekiller Arceus.</p>

<p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 204 HP / 208 Atk / 64 SpD / 32 Spe<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Sacred Fire<br />
- Brave Bird<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>One of the 2 reasons this team was built. Ho-Oh was the first Uber Pokemon I've caught in my first Pokemon Game (Gold), and...well, I've always loved this giant colored chicken. Ho-Oh hits...REALLY hard, and it's an amazing Special wall, all in the same Pokemon, how amazing is that!!! So, the EVs in HPs are to reach 404 (not sure about that, I probably should run 4 more hp evs so I can switch into SR twice...), some EVs in Special Defense to reach the extra point (394 -> 396), since it's my backup switch in for Draco Meteors and other special attacks, 32 Speed to speed creep (yes, I'm obsessed with that), the rest goes in Attack to further increase the already huge damage output. SubRoost for survivability, then the 2 STABs, Sacred Fire's chance to burn helps a lot, and Brave Bird obliterates everything that doesn't resist it (also, not many Pokemon commonly seen in Ubers resist Flying).</p>

<p><strong>Groudon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Drought<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 96 Def / 136 SpD / 24 Spe <br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Dragon Tail<br />
- Fire Punch<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Since this is a sun team it's kinda obvious to have this big guy in the team. It always gets the weather up, unless I'm facing a REALLY slow Kyogre, and in both cases it's a free switch in to my Palkia (if early game), or even to Forry / keeping Groudon in in case of predictions or other particular situations. Max HP are pretty obvious, I need this guy to check some really dangerous threat such as SD Arceus, opposing Dual Dance Groudons, and Zekrom. The EVs in Special Defense are for it to always survive +2 Dark Pulse from LO Darkrai after SR, 24 EVs are in Speed to speed creep other base 90 (Ubers is full of those), while the rest gets dumped in Defense, with a positive nature, to check the threat I spoken of before</p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Protect<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Roar</p>

<p>The 2nd reason for which this team was built. I had never success with Heatran in Ubers until I've built this. First off, it's a great check to most of the Dragon types in the tier, it can also stall quite a lot of things, and it also gives me a fire immunity (Ho-Oh has problems switching into Fire moves if Rocks are up). Toxic helps mainly against Kyogre switch ins, and forces Giratina to rest, Flamethrower 2HKOs Dialga in sun and hits insanely powerful even with only 4 EVs, Protect helps me racking up Toxic damage, as well as scouting the opponent's move, especially of choiced mons, since things such as Scarf/Specs Kyogre loves switching into Heatran. Amazing Pokemon overall, although it probably is the weak link of the team.</p>

<p><strong>Palkia</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 232 HP / 96 SpD / 180 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Roar<br />
- Thunder<br />
- Spacial Rend<br />
- Fire Blast</p>

<p>This Palkia set is kinda weird, it's an idea I had randomly while looking for a Kyogre switch in. I was already aware of the fact that Palkia is a good switch in for the fat whale, but honestly with a standard offensive set it wouldn't have had enough survivability to withstand its assault for a whole game, so I came up with this. the speed is to outspeed neutral natured base 90s (Modest SpecsOgre mainly). I got enough Special Defense to get the extra point (328 -> 330), and the rest got dumped in HPs. I don't run a water STAB because it's kinda pointless in sun, and if I'm facing a rain team, they'd have already an excellent water resist in Kyogre + all the other dragons, so I just went for this, it hits already everything I need it to hit. Roar is the small twist I decided to use. Since I have hazards, and Palkia forces switches, Roar sounded like a good choice on paper, and it was even in practice. It helps me roasting Chansey on entry hazards, as well as other walls that come in to ruin my fun. Also, it gives me an additional weapon against SmashPass, as well as something to get rid of some setuppers that try to set up on Palkia (SD Arceus primarily)...if only Palkia got Scald...</p>

<p><strong>Arceus-Dragon</strong> @ Draco Plate<br />
Ability: Multitype<br />
EVs: 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Judgment<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>My endgame sweeper. I needed something that could resist Water, Fire, and could set up on most of the walls and kill Giratina easily, so the choice was on a SubCM Arceus, and Dragon seemed to fit this team the best. The EVs in Speed are there to outspeed max speed neutral Arceus, max Special Attack for maximum damage output, rest in HP for bulk (also, 101+ HPs substitutes for Chansey/Blissey). Abuses of the work of the rest of the team (Ho-Oh / Heatran already obliterate all the Steel types), and can set up on some walls, it also has excellent neutral coverage and not much can stop it. Also, Dragon Arceus is kinda uncommon (unless I just never face those for one reason or another).</p>
