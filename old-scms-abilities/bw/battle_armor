<h2>Description</h2> 
<p>The wielder cannot be struck by critical hits.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2> 
<p>This ability is situationally useful, but suffers as there is very little that it can really accomplish outside of being a useful little perk. Another problem with it is its relatively low distribution; only three Pokemon, <a href="/bw/pokemon/kabutops/">Kabutops</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/armaldo">Armaldo</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/drapion">Drapion</a>, receive this ability outside of the Dream World. Generally speaking, Kabutops will almost always prefer <a href="/bw/abilities/swift_swim">Swift Swim</a>, though Armaldo and Drapion can perhaps find some use of it. <a href="/bw/pokemon/marowak">Marowak</a> receives it from the Dream World, and certainly it is more useful than <a href="/bw/abilities/lightningrod">Lightningrod</a>, as well as <a href="/bw/abilities/rock_head">Rock Head</a> should you not be using <a href="/bw/moves/double-edge">Double-Edge</a>.</p>
