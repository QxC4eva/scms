- Weak to Stealth Rock

Eviolite
########
name: Eviolite
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Morning Sun
move 3: Toxic / Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Sunny Day / Will-O-Wisp
ability: Flame Body
item: Eviolite
evs: 76 Atk / 236 Def / 196 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

- Will-O-Wisp and Toxic for Physical Attackers and Walls, respectively. Namely Mienfoo, Pawniard, Medittie, Archen, Vullaby, Slowpoke, or etc.
- Sunny Day + Toxic allows you to be able to outstall and kill a Slowpoke one on one, weakening Scald's power, strengthening Flare Blitz's power, and boosting Morning Sun's recovery.
- Morning Sun and the Def EVs allow for you to make Flame Body more likely to burn a physical attacking opponent.
- Will-O-Wisp is obvious and more reliable for burning Pokemon, who dodge Flame Body's burn chance, especially if they're not using contact moves.

Set Details
========

- Max speed to speed tie 19 speed mons (Murkow, Misdreauvs, Staryu)
- 236  Def EVs are need to avoid the  2hko from pawniard, then you can just  morning sun and it cannot kill you  with sucker punch. Don't think of  moving some Def EVs to HP because  then Pawniard can 2hko you with Knock Off. Be careful of Swords Dance Sucker Punch, however, as it can OHKO you after a Knock Off if you Morning Sun on it.
- 76 Atk EVs give Flare Blitz a OHKO on Eviolite Pawniard most of the time.
- Eviolite gives Ponyta bulk from both sides
- 76 SpA EVs with a Timid nature and Fire Blast over Flare Blitz is an option for a no recoil move. But its 85% accuracy, low pp, and lower damage than Flare Blitz leave it unfavorable as it will often miss a vital OHKO that Flare Blitz could have secured on key Pokemon, such as Pawniard and Murkrow.

Usage Tips
========

- Switch into Pokemon with contact moves that aren't super-effective against Ponyta, namely Pawniard and Mienfoo.
- Beware of Stealth Rock and remember that Timburr has Guts, so it is not wise to switch into him.

Team Options
========

- Defog and Rapid Spin users can be appreciated as Ponyta is weak to Stealth Rock.
- A core of Lileep, Slowpoke, and Ponyta can be used to success as Ponyta is able to counter Pawniard and Mienfoo, both of which run straight through Lileep and Slowpoke.
- Drilbur is an excellent partner as it can provide Rapid Spin support and can take on Rock-Type Pokemon such as Dwebble and Cranidos, which Ponyta hates.

Special Sunny Day
########
name: Special Sunny Day
move 1: Sunny Day
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Solar Beam
move 4: Morning Sun
ability: Flame Body
item: Eviolite
evs: 236 Def / 76 SpA / 196 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

- Sunny day weakens water types allowing it to take reduces damage from water switch ins. also helps with every other move on this set.
- Fire blast is powerful under sun etc...
- Solar beam is the cool thing about the set, meaning no water types can take it on 1v1, except sturdy tirtouga. the only other annoying thing is slowpoke's/chinchou's thunder wave.
- Morning sun heals more under sun which is cool
- Basically more of a Chinchou and other water types lure set, perhaps the moves could use reordering, but its pretty straightforward.

Set Details
========
- 76 SpAtk EVs are needed to 2hko 76/228 Chinchou with Solarbeam, and a  50% chance to KO 0/0 Berry Juice Chinchou.
- 236 Def EVs are need to avoid the  2hko from pawniard, then you can just morning sun and it cannot kill you  with sucker punch. Don't think of moving some Def EVs to HP because  then Pawniard can 2hko you with Knock Off. Be careful of Swords Dance Sucker Punch, however, as it can OHKO you after a Knock Off if you Morning Sun on it.
- Max speed to speed tie 19 speed mons (Murkow, Misdreauvs, Staryu)
- Eviolite gives Ponyta bulk from both sides

Usage Tips
========

- Switch into stuff like Pawniard / Mienfoo / Physical Attackers that use contact moves and dislike being burned, such as Meditite. Morning Sun when needed. Sunny Day as much as possible as that allows it to do its job more easily and helps so much vs. water type switch-ins which are super common.
- Aside from Solar Beam, all of these moves only have 8 PP, so watch out for being PP stalled in longer matches.

Team Options
========

- Things that appreciate sunny day are okay, but really not necessary. this is meant as more of a stand alone sunny day user.
- Things that would appreciate Water-Types, such as Chinchou and Staryu, out of the way can pair well with this set and Ponyta can lure them in and KO them with Solar Beam. Fletchling, for example, would appreciate Chinchou being KOd or at least weakened enough to be taken out by an Acrobatics.
- Drilbur is also an excellent partner as it can provide Rapid Spin support, dislikes Staryu and Chinchou, and can take on Rock-Type Pokemon such as Dwebble and Archen, which this Ponyta hates.

Other Options
########

- Hypnosis has low accuracy, but puts Pokemon to sleep.
- Iron Tail, Low Kick, Body Slam, and Bounce when Super Effective all get  outdamaged by a neutral STAB Flare Blitz, and 30% chance for para is  not only low, but interferes with Ponyta's other status options. 
- Quick Attack, Baton Pass is illegal.
- Flame Charge and Agility why do you want more speed you're at 19 speed  already and it's not the best strategy in Little Cup anyway.
- A Life Orb set of Jolly, 36 HP / 236 Atk / 196 Spe, Flare Blitz, Wild Charge, and your choice of Return, Will-O-Wisp, or Morning Sun is possible. You can OHKO or 2HKO a lot of things, while 2HKOing Chinchou and Slowpoke with Return or Wild Charge, respectively. However, the lack of bulk and priority make it really mediocre as it dies rather quickly. It is hard to switch in and a bit prediction heavy. For example, if you don't use a Wild Charge on a Slowpoke on the switch in, you will be forced out or die to its attack. The same it is for most Pokemon you don't immediately OHKO, and you only speed tie with Murkrow and Misdreavus. Basically, why use Life Orb Ponyta when you can use Life Orb Murkrow.


Checks & Counters
########

- Stealth Rock is Ponyta's number 1 enemy, taking 25% (or rounded in LC to whatever HP thanks to LC mechanics) off its HP
- While Ponyta can Toxic walls that it cannot normally beat, walls can use Toxic on Ponyta as well, effectively destroying its walling abilities. This is especially true if your opponent has Heal Bell or Aromatherapy.
- Houndour with Flash Fire is Ponyta's best counter as it takes nothing from Solar Beam and doesn't particularly mind Toxic, while it strikes it back with STAB Dark-Type moves.
- Eviolite Mantyke fails to be 2HKOd by Sunny Day Flare Blitz and can threaten it back with a STAB Water-Type move
- Torchic, while not really a check or counter, can easily set up on it and Baton Pass Speed and/or other boosts to Pokemon that would then be able to outspeed and KO Ponyta, such as speed and a Swords Dance to Drilbur (Earthquake)
- Munchlax, while it dislikes Burn and Toxic, doesn't fear Flare Blitz or Solar Beam, thanks to Thick Fat and Recycle/Rest, and can threaten it with Body Slam paralysis or a super-effective Earthquake
- Porygon likewise dislikes Toxic, but when EVd to take on Flare Blitz or Fire Blast (or if it traces Flash Fire if Ponyta has that as its ability), it can threaten it with powerful special attack moves and use Recover
- Scarf Frillish can outspeed and OHKO it with a Water Spout (or Hydro Pump most of the time) if the sun isn't up
- Scarf Cranidos can outspeed and OHKO it with a Stone Edge or Head Smash
- Timburr somewhat enjoys burn, but doesn't like to switch into a Sunny Day Fire Blast or Flare Blitz.
