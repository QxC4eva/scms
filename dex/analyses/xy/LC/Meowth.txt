Overview
########
Meowth is blessed with a great ability in Technician, which patches up its mediocre Attack stat by powering up Fake Out. It receives decent attack options such as Knock Off, U-turn, and Covet. Meowth also reaches the coveted 19 Speed, which allows it to Speed tie with threats such as Ponyta and Misdreavus. Even with this going for Meowth, it possesses almost non-existent bulk and no resistances bar an immunity to Ghost-type moves, and a weakness to Fighting-type moves. All of this makes it incredibly difficult for Meowth to switch in reliably. Furthermore, Fake Out spam is not reliable at higher level play due to the predictability of the strategy. Meowth also receives competition from Aipom, but Technician makes Meowth arguably better than Aipom.

Moves
========

Fake Out has high priority, more so than any other priority attack, and can be used whenever Meowth is sent in. It hits very hard with STAB and Technician, especially when combined with Meowth's item, Normal Gem. This combination of boosts gives it easily the strongest Fake Out in the tier and outclasses some of the best users of the move, such as Mienfoo. Covet works very well with Fake Out and Normal Gem, as the aforementioned item is used up by Fake Out, freeing up the item slot for Covet to steal an item. Covet benefits from Meowth's Technician boost, making Return an inferior option. However if Life Orb is used, Return is usually better. Meowth outspeeds most of the tier when using a Jolly nature, so having an extremely fast U-turn allows Meowth to be a very effective pivot. Knock Off allows Meowth to hit Ghost-types such as Misdreavus extremely hard, and has decent coverage with Meowth's Normal-type STAB. This allows Meowth to help out its teammates, by providing an extremely fast Knock Off, which often allows another Pokemon to sweep.

Set Details
========

196 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allows Meowth to hit 19 Speed, which is essential to tie with fast threats such as Misdreavus, and also to outspeed Pokemon such as Mienfoo. 236 Attack allows Meowth to be an effective revenge killere. The remaining 36 EVs can be put into HP or Special Defense, as they are mostly filler. Normal Gem is the preferred item, as it allows Meowth to abuse Covet and have an extremely powerful Fake Out. Life Orb can be used if the loss of an item disturbs you, or if Return is used. The extra power also helps a lot with Meowth's other moves. If you opt to use Life Orb, be sure to reduce your HP IVs to zero to minimize Life Orb recoil.

Usage Tips
========

When sent out, Fake Out should almost always be used unless Meowth is paired up against a Ghost-type. use U-turn if a situation is not ideal as switching out allows Meowth to use Fake Out again. Meowth has zero resistances and only one immunity, so switching in on attacks is extremely hard for Meowth so it must be played as conservatively as possible. Meowth is best at revenge killing, so abuse Meowth's Fake Out and fast U-turn as much as possible.

Team options
========

Ghost-types are nice partners to Meowth, specifically Misdreavus. Misdreavus can usually switch in on Fighting-types, being immune to their STAB Fighting-type attacks. Meowth can usually help weaken physical walls such as Spritzee or Porygon, allowing Misdreavus to plow through them with ease. Although Misdreavus makes a great teammate to Meowth, Meowth also has problems with Misdreavus. As such, a Pokemon such as Pursuit Pawniard can make a great partner, as it traps Misdreavus and other Ghost-types. Meowth functions best on teams that can maintain offensive momentum, so Pokemon that can U-turn or Volt Switch in and out of battle are great. Teammates such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Archen work extremely well. Slower U-turn users such as Vullaby and Bunnelby are even more beneficial.

Other Options
########

Switcheroo can be used to pass on crippling items to other Pokemon, such as a Flame Orb or a Choice Scarf. Double Edge can be used over Return for a stronger STAB option; however, the added recoil is usually heavily unwanted, as Meowth's already limited longevity is cut even thinner. Feint is an option for a secondary priority attack to allow Meowth to strike with priority after the first turn. This can be used to revenge kill weakened setup sweepers, such as a +1 Scraggy. Seed Bomb can be used to hit Tirtouga with a super effective 4x attack, and it also deals a great amount of damage to Chinchou. Hypnosis can be used to create momentum in tandem with U-turn, but is heavily unreliable.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Bulkier Fighting-types can take a hit and retaliate with their super effective STAB attacks, which can cleanly KO Meowth. Timburr and Croagunk can attack Meowth with STAB priority. Scraggy can set up a Dragon Dance or KO Meowth with Drain Punch. Mienfoo can KO Meowth with Drain Punch and recover any lost health by switching out.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types resist Meowth's STAB and can generally hit Meowth hard. Pawniard can deprive Meowth of its item while cleanly OHKOing it. Ferroseed can paralyze it with Thunder Wave and hit it with Iron Head or Bullet Seed.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types can switch in on Meowth's STAB thanks to their immunity to Normal-type attacks. They can then burn Meowth or hit it with a strong attack. However, Meowth's Knock Off can deter them from switching in, and its high Speed lets it outspeed or tie with most Ghost-types.

**Status**: Status effects are one of the worst things for Meowth to have. The burn effect completely cripples Meowth, as does paralysis.
