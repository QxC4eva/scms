<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder lowers the enemy's Attack stat one stage upon entering the battlefield. Affects adjacent opponents in multi battles. Intimidate will immediately activate whenever the ability is acquired, such as through <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>. When a Pokemon with this ability is first in the party, wild encounters have a lower chance of occurring.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Intimidate is one of the best abilities in the game. It allows Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/gyarados">Gyarados</a> to switch in on normally threatening physical attackers and proceed to set up thanks to the buffer. The best effect of Intimidate is that it works immediately as the Pokemon switches in, and doesn't require the use of a turn. This makes it so that the user can bring a +1 Attack sweeping Pokemon back down to +0, and then react in the same turn. However, Intimidate is now less common in today's metagame due to the fact that most of the users have either fallen out of favor or have received better abilities. The metagame has also become more balanced in terms of attacking prowess from the physical and special side, meaning that there are less Pokemon significantly affected by Intimidate. Finally, the opponent can remove the effects of Intimidate by simply switching.</p>
