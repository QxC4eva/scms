<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>ADV NU is an interesting but extremely fun tier to say the least.  It has unique offensive threats that don't really have any counterparts in later or earlier generations, few Spikers and spinners, creating an interesting entry hazard scenario, and an almost complete absence of 5 whole types (Steel, Dark, Dragon, Electric, and Psychic).  In a couple of past Smogon tournaments, NFEs weren't allowed, but for the purposes of this threat list I've included the relevant ones.  Note that this tiering does not follow Smogon's NU tiering. A full list can be found here. Chansey, Scyther, and Kadabra are NFEs that are banned and aren't a part of another tiering.

<h2>Offensive Threats</h2>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/bellossom.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/bellossom"><strong>Bellossom</strong></a><br />
Typing: Grass<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 80 Atk / 85 Def / 90 SpA / 100 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Ability: Chlorophyll</p>

<p>Bellossom's movepool and ability are tailor-made to run a sun sweeper set, normally consisting of Sunny Day, SolarBeam, Hidden Power Fire, and Sleep Powder.  Sleep Powder is probably what makes Bellossom as dangerous as it is, being able to completely incapacitate a foe that it normally can't OHKO, or provide itself with a free opportunity to set up Sunny Day. Bellossom also has an advantage over Tangela as a sun sweeper by having significantly more special bulk. Other possible sets to look out for are SubSeed and Double Powder, as Bellossom is certainly bulky enough to pull off a support or tank role on a team.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/cacturne.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/cacturne"><strong>Cacturne </strong></a><br />
Typing: Grass / Dark<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 115 Atk / 60 Def / 115 SpA / 60 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Ability: Sand Veil</p>

<p>Cacturne is hard to use and is rarely seen because it's so slow and frail, but its massive mixed attacking stats and good movepool just cannot be completely ignored. With paralysis support, SubPunch Cacturne is a monster, blasting away nearly every wall with either Focus Punch or Hidden Power Ghost. specially attacking sets with Giga Drain, ThunderPunch, and Hidden Power Dark, and SubSeed sets are also dangerous offensive sets to be aware of, though they offer less immediate power. Cacturne also has a niche in NU as one of the very few Pokemon with access to Spikes, though it's almost completely outclassed by Glalie and, to a lesser extent, Roselia in the role. Finally, always be careful of Destiny Bond when dealing with Cacturne.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/charmeleon.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/charmeleon"><strong>Charmeleon </strong></a><br />
Typing: Fire<br />
Base Stats: 58 HP / 64 Atk / 58 Def / 80 SpA / 65 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Ability: Blaze</p>

<p>You'll probably never see a Charmeleon in the tier, but it offers a combination of two things that no other Pokemon in the tier does: a decent Speed stat with Fire STAB.  Base 80 is actually surprisingly good in the tier, letting it outpace a large number of even offensive threats. Unfortunately for it, Fire STAB moves are about the extent of its special movepool. On the flip side, STAB Fire Blast from base 80 Special Attack isn't too shabby, and when combined with Hidden Power Grass, Charmeleon can cut through a number of the typical walls in the tier. Because of its Speed, Belly Drum could be a possibility, but its physical movepool is pretty bad and it can be incredibly hard to set up.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/chimecho.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/chimecho"><strong>Chimecho </strong></a><br />
Typing: Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 50 Atk / 70 Def / 95 SpA / 80 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Chimecho is actually one of the most defining Pokemon of the tier. As the only usable Psychic-type, it resides as one of the tier's only Hitmonchan counters and Calm Mind users. Levitate is a huge blessing, giving it an immunity to Spikes and Choice Band-locked Earthquakes. Chimecho is also one of the most offensively and defensively versatile Pokemon available, being able to run sets ranging from SubCM, Calm Mind + RestTalk, offensive Calm Mind, and everything in between. Taunt, Yawn, Toxic, and Disable fill out an impressive status repertoire, and access to Heal Bell gives it an opportunity to fill the role of cleric. Reflect and Light Screen are also a possibility. Chimecho will have Psychic to ensure it effectively counters Hitmonchan and can fight off Haunter, with the rest of its offensive movepool being any of Hidden Power Fire, Hidden Power Dark, or Shock Wave.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/crawdaunt.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/crawdaunt"><strong>Crawdaunt </strong></a><br /> 
Typing: Water / Dark<br />
Base Stats: 63 HP / 120 Atk / 85 Def / 90 SpA / 55 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Abilities: Hyper Cutter / Shell Armor </p>

<p>Crawdaunt is another Pokemon with massive attacking stats, but is let down by its really low Speed and weak defenses. Crawdaunt is typically left out in favor of Relicanth or Kingler, but its mixed attacking stats gives it the ability to break through some defensive threats they can't, Tangela in particular. Not having a physical STAB sucks, but Choice Band Return will still hurt, and Brick Break, Sludge Bomb, Surf, Ice Beam, and Crunch are all good coverage moves. Once it gets in, something's gonna get hurt.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/flareon.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/flareon"><strong>Flareon </strong></a><br />
Typing: Fire<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 130 Atk / 60 Def / 95 SpA / 110 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Ability: Flash Fire</p>

<p>Flareon is a huge offensive threat due solely to that absolutely massive base 130 Attack stat. Although it can't use its STAB effectively on a Choice Band set, it really doesn't need it. Return, Shadow Ball, Hidden Power Ground, and Iron Tail or Quick Attack is all the muscle it needs to pummel the walls of the tier. Its Speed is also just decent enough to make use of, outpacing key defensive Pokemon such as Chimecho. It is possible to use a defensive set with Wish or a special attacking set to make use of its Fire STAB, but these are generally less effective in practice. Granted, 65/110 special defense is nothing to scoff at, and it hard counters the Grass-types in the tier as well as Plusle and Minun.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/glalie.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/glalie"><strong>Glalie </strong></a><br /> 
Typing: Ice<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 80 Atk / 80 Def / 80 SpA / 80 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Ability: Inner Focus</p>

<p>The absolute premier Spiker in the tier, almost always seen as a lead. Glalie vs Glalie wars are very common, and while there are other Spikers in the tier, Glalie beats them all one-on-one. Sets can vary pretty widely apart from the Spikes commonality, with specially attacking, physically attacking, and fast defensive sets all being usable. Explosion and Taunt are also very common on Glalie in order to try and limit the other team from setting up Spikes or using Glalie as setup bait for another Pokemon. Ice Beam and Earthquake are typically used as coverage depending on the EV placement. Less commonly seen coverage moves include Hidden Power Fire, Crunch, and Shadow Ball.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/graveler.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/graveler"><strong>Graveler </strong></a><br />
Typing: Rock / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 95 Atk / 115 Def / 45 SpA / 45 SpD / 35 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sturdy / Rock Head</p>

<p>Rock-bottom Speed prevents Graveler from becoming a top tier threat, but STAB QuakeSlide coverage is brutal coming off base 95 Attack, and absolutely destructive when combined with a Choice Band. In addition, it's a very good counter to many of the other Choice Band users in the tier, including Flareon, Pidgeot, and Murkrow. Although it's very hard to switch into Graveler safely, particularly with the looming threat of an Explosion, it's easily dismantled by any Grass- or Water-type attack, and even most Ice-type attacks as well. Hitmonchan as well as Rock- or Ground-types with Earthquake also have an easy time disposing of Graveler.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/haunter.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/haunter"><strong>Haunter </strong></a><br />
Typing: Ghost / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 45 HP / 50 Atk / 45 Def / 115 SpA / 55 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Substitute Haunter is another tier-defining threat in NU. Amazing Spe<br />ed and ridiculous Spe<br />cial Attack, along with a great ability in Levitate and being the only usable Ghost-type in the tier, means Haunter has a lot going for it. It's relatively difficult to switch Haunter in safely due to its basically non-existent defenses, but once it's in, look out! It also has the advantage of sporting 3 immunities, and with the prevalence of Choice Band users in the tier, getting a free Substitute up when the time arises can be an easy task. Apart from its atrocious defenses, the main thing keeping it back is its lack of usable STAB. Thunderbolt, Giga Drain, Psychic, and Hidden Power Ice or Dark do provide really good coverage, though unfortunately, not all at once because it does need to run Substitute to protect itself from status and those that can tank an attack. And when the time comes to actually knock Haunter out, it can either go out with a bang via Explosion, or take the foe with it with Destiny Bond.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/hitmonchan.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/hitmonchan"><strong>Hitmonchan </strong></a><br />
Typing: Fighting<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 105 Atk / 79 Def / 35 SpA / 110 SpD / 76 Spe<br />
Ability: Keen Eye</p>

<p>Possibly the absolute pinnacle of the tier, Hitmonchan is certainly the one Pokemon above all others you need to be prepared for. A combination of great power, Speed, and a beautiful STAB move in Sky Uppercut creates a truly amazing Pokemon. The most common set is a simple Choice Band set consisting of Sky Uppercut, Hidden Power Ghost, Rock Slide, and Mach Punch. Another common set uses Bulk Up to take advantage of its decent bulk. Other sets to watch out for include SubPunch and an Agility sweeper. Lastly, of major note is Hitmonchan's access to Rapid Spin. While it is one of the few with access to the move, the power of its Choice Band set is just too good to pass up in most cases.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/huntail.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/huntail"><strong>Huntail </strong></a><br />
Tying: Water<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 104 Atk / 105 Def / 94 SpA / 75 SpD / 52 Spe<br />
Ability: Swift Swim</p>

<p>Huntail resides as the tier's only Swift Swim sweeper, and a doozy of a one at that. Its low initial Speed is a let down, but in the rain this is no longer an issue. And with great mixed stats, countering Huntail in the rain is a daunting task. It will typically be just specially attacking though, with STAB Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Hidden Power Electric or Grass, and Crunch providing almost all it needs. However, Return and a physical Hidden Power, such as Bug, are also usable. To cap it all off, access to Baton Pass means getting out when the rain is about to let up is a relatively simple task as well.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/kingler.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/kingler"><strong>Kingler </strong></a><br />
Typing: Water<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 130 Atk / 115 Def / 50 SpA / 50 SpD / 75 Spe<br />
Abilities: Hyper Cutter / Shell Armor </p>

<p>Lack of usable STAB sucks hard, but a huge base 130 Attack stat backed up a great base 75 Speed stat is hard to ignore. Unfortunately for it, Kingler's physical movepool is pretty atrocious. Double-Edge, Hidden Power Ground, and Metal Claw are about all it's got going for it, though they do hit hard. Really, Kingler is a rare threat, but its speed and power are something to be aware of.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/machoke.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/machoke"><strong>Machoke </strong></a><br />
Typing: Fighting<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 100 Atk / 70 Def / 50 SpA / 60 SpD / 45 Spe<br />
Ability: Guts</p>

<p>There's little reason to use Machoke over Hitmonchan, but the power boost from Guts and general bulkiness in comparison can come in handy in certain situations and are notable. A Choice Band set consisting of Cross Chop, Hidden Power Ghost, Rock Slide, and Double-Edge is probably the best available set. A RestTalk + Bulk Up set is another possibility as well to capitalize on its decent physical bulk.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/minun.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/minun"><strong>Minun </strong></a><br />
Typing: Electric<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 40 Atk / 50 Def / 75 SpA / 85 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Ability: Minus</p>

<p>One of two usable Electric-types in the tier, there's little reason to use Minun over the stronger Plusle in general. However, it is possible to use it, and a Substitute set with Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Ice or Grass, and Baton Pass is standard. Because it is ever so slightly bulkier, Minun is probably better at using any other kind of status moves such as Toxic or Encore, or set up moves like Light Screen. Another move of note is Wish, with Minun being one of the few Pokemon with access to the move in the tier and most definitely the fastest.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/murkrow.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/murkrow"><strong>Murkrow </strong></a><br />
Typing: Dark / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 85 Atk / 42 Def / 85 SpA / 42 SpD / 91 Spe<br />
Ability: Insomnia</p>

<p>Murkrow stands out as one of the fastest Choice Band users in the tier; in fact, it's tied for the second fastest with its partner in crime Pidgeot. On top of that, it has access to a great Flying STAB move in Drill Peck, allowing it to use Hidden Power as a coverage move, typically Ground.  Steel Wing, Double-Edge, and Shadow Ball fill out the rest of the set. Going mixed or special is also possible, but not as effective in most cases. While its support movepool is huge, its defenses simply do not allow for it.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/pidgeot.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/pidgeot"><strong>Pidgeot </strong></a><br />
Typing: Normal / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 83 HP / 80 Atk / 75 Def / 70 SpA / 70 SpD / 91 Spe<br />
Ability: Keen Eye</p>

<p>While Murkrow offers slightly more power and a Flying STAB move in Drill Peck, Pidgeot counters with far more bulk and STAB Return and Double-Edge. It's still your standard Choice Band user, with a set almost always consisting of Return, Aerial Ace, Hidden Power Ground, and Quick Attack. There's almost no reason to use any other set, but there is a possibility of a Substitute + 3 attacks set.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/piloswine.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/piloswine"><strong>Piloswine </strong></a><br />
Typing: Ice / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 100 Atk / 80 Def / 60 SpA / 60 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Ability: Oblivious</p>

<p>Piloswine is THE tank of the NU tier. Its typing is pretty bad, but it can survive nearly any unboosted attack in the tier and retaliate with an appropriate Choice Band-boosted attack. STAB Earthquake coming off base 100 Attack is simply incredible, with Rock Slide, Double-Edge, and Hidden Power Ghost or Bug rounding out the coverage. It typically won't be running much Speed in order to take advantage of its really good bulk, but beware of its ability to speed creep up to many of the defensive threats in the tier.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/plusle.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/plusle"><strong>Plusle </strong></a><br />
Tying: Electric<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 50 Atk / 40 Def / 85 SpA / 75 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Ability: Plus</p>

<p>Basically the only usable Electric-type in the tier besides Minun, Plusle will be the one you see most often due to its higher Special Attack. Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice or Grass are an almost guaranteed feature of any Plusle set, with Substitute, Baton Pass, Encore, Thunder Wave, and Wish filling out the other two slots. Substitute and Baton Pass are the most common out of the bunch to protect itself from status and ease switching predictions. While Plusle doesn't have any way of boosting its Special Attack, its Electric STAB and super high Speed ensures its presence on offense teams.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/pupitar.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/pupitar"><strong>Pupitar </strong></a><br />
Typing: Rock / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 84 Atk / 70 Def / 65 SpA / 70 SpD / 51 Spe<br />
Ability: Shed Skin</p>

<p>While in normal circumstances Pupitar's completely outclassed by the likes of Graveler, Piloswine, and Sudowoodo, it separates itself from the pack with its access to Dragon Dance. This move morphs it from a mediocre threat to an absolute powerhouse in one turn. Although its set up opportunities are few, it can find an opening against most defensive Pokemon thanks to its immunity to Thunder Wave and ability to shrug off burn and status with Shed Skin. STAB QuakeSlide is a given, with Double-Edge rounding off the set.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/raticate.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/raticate"><strong>Raticate </strong></a><br />
Typing: Normal<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 81 Atk / 60 Def / 50 SpA / 70 SpD / 97 Spe<br />
Abilities: Run Away / Guts</p>

<p>Raticate can be a terrifying late-game cleaner thanks to its decent Attack and crazy Speed. In fact, Raticate is the fastest usable unboosted Pokemon in the tier. It'll typically be running a Choice Band set, and whatever you do, do NOT hit it with burn or poison or it's pretty much game at that point. Its sets will usually consist of Return, Shadow Ball, Hidden Power Ground, and either Super Fang or Facade. Other sets include an Endure + Reversal set or a Substitute + Endeavor set, both of which can be absolutely devastating, especially considering there's no Sand Stream in the tier to ruin the fun prematurely.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/relicanth.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/relicanth"><strong>Relicanth </strong></a><br />
Typing: Water / Rock<br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 90 Atk / 130 Def / 45 SpA / 65 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Abilities: Swift Swim / Rock Head</p>

<p>Relicanth is actually a very versatile offensive threat. A straight Choice Band set of Rock Slide, Earthquake, Double-Edge, and Hidden Power Ghost or Bug is the most common, as it fits easily on many teams and offers a lot of power and decent bulk. Its huge physical defense can be taken advantage of via a simple RestTalk tank set. Finally, one of its abilities, Swift Swim, transforms Relicanth from a slow tank into a super fast cleaner. While it can't take advantage of the rain to boost its attacks unlike Huntail, the Speed is all that's really needed.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/seadra.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/seadra"><strong>Seadra </strong></a><br />
Typing: Water<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 65 Atk / 95 Def / 95 SpA / 45 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Ability: Poison Point</p>

<p>Seadra is another one that you're highly unlikely to ever encounter, since it just doesn't really bring a whole lot to the table. It is interesting and worth mentioning though, because it is the fastest and strongest Water-type attacker in the tier without needing any setup. Although Huntail is vastly superior with rain, Seadra doesn't need weather to outspeed a large portion of the tier, meaning it's probably better suited to straight offense teams. Its movepool is shallow, but Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Hidden Power Grass, and any of Substitute, Agility, or Toxic is all it needs.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/shelgon.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/shelgon"><strong>Shelgon </strong></a><br />
Typing: Dragon<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 95 Atk / 100 Def / 60 SpA / 50 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Ability: Rock Head</p>

<p>Shelgon is about the only usable Dragon-type in the tier, and it puts its typing to good use with a variety of offensive, defensive, and tank sets. The big thing that Shelgon has going for it offensively is Dragon Dance. After a boost or two, Shelgon becomes an offensive monster, particularly since it's relatively easy to find setup opportunities. Lack of usable STAB holds back the set, but recoil-less Double-Edge really packs on the hurt after a couple of boosts, and Brick Break, Rock Slide, and Hidden Power Ghost make for great coverage moves. Base 95 Attack is good enough to run a simple Choice Band set as well, though it's relatively easy to revenge kill due to Shelgon's lack of Special Defense and low Speed.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/sudowoodo.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/sudowoodo"><strong>Sudowoodo </strong></a><br />
Typing: Rock<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 100 Atk / 115 Def / 30 SpA / 65 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sturdy / Rock Head</p>

<p>Sudowoodo usually has to compete with Graveler and Relicanth for a spot on a team due to having a lot of similarities to both. Although Sudowoodo lacks STAB on Earthquake and is not as physically defensive as Relicanth, it's kind of a middle ground Pokemon. It's stronger and more defensively sound than Graveler, and it's stronger than Relicanth and lacks a weakness to Electric-type attacks. Its set will usually be a simple Choice Band set of Rock Slide, Earthquake, Double-Edge, and Explosion. Defensive or tank Sudowoodo is a possibility, with Leftovers used over Choice Band, but the incredible power of its Explosion is hard to pass up.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/tangela.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/tangela"><strong>Tangela </strong></a><br />
Typing: Grass<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 55 Atk / 115 Def / 100 SpA / 40 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Ability: Chlorophyll</p>

<p>Sunny Day Tangela is truly terrifying. It's incredibly fast under the sun, wields Sleep Powder to incapacitate any foe it desires, and blows away any other Pokemon in its way with SolarBeam and Hidden Power Fire. Its main advantages over Bellossom are its much higher Defense and slightly superior Special Attack and Speed. That Defense stat grants it what's basically a free setup opportunity against most Choice Band users stuck in a non-STAB attack or Earthquake. However, it is very specially defensively weak and will likely be KOed quite easily if hit by any Ice- or Fire-type attack.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/venomoth.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/venomoth"><strong>Venomoth </strong></a><br />
Typing: Bug / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 65 Atk / 60 Def / 90 SpA / 75 SpD / 90 Spe<br />
Ability: Shield Dust</p>

<p>Venomoth is a weird Pokemon to consider in the tier. The main thing to watch out for from it are Sleep Powder and Stun Spore. From there, there's not a lot to worry about, though its STAB Sludge Bomb and Signal Beam can hurt and are rare attacking types in the tier. It does have access to Baton Pass as well, meaning a Substitute + Baton Pass is possible, and when combined with Sleep Powder can give a Pokemon like Huntail or Pupitar an easy setup opportunity. Its Special Attack is much higher than its Attack but offers no STAB move, though Psychic and Giga Drain are available to it, and its typing means that it's a good switch-in to Hitmonchan and easily lures out Rock-types.</p>

 <p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/vigoroth.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/vigoroth"><strong>Vigoroth </strong></a><br />
Typing: Normal<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 80 Atk / 80 Def / 55 SpA / 55 SpD / 90 Spe<br />
Ability: Vital Spirit</p>

<p>One of the most diverse threats in the tier, Vigoroth is a Pokemon you need to be prepared for when building your team. With sets ranging from a terrifying Flail + Reversal set, to an offensive and defensive Bulk Up set, to a defensive stallbreaker, Vigoroth brings a ton to the table. Its gigantic movepool is backed by a fantastic ability in Vital Spirit, a great Speed stat of 90, and good base 80 Attack. Unfortunately, its Speed leaves it just outsped by the likes of Pidgeot, Murkrow, Plusle, and Haunter, something Raticate boasts over it. However, the sheer versatility of Vigoroth is more than enough to make it one of the best Pokemon in the tier.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/whiscash.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/whiscash"><strong>Whiscash </strong></a><br />
Typing: Water / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 110 HP / 78 Atk / 73 Def / 76 SpA / 71 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Ability: Oblivious</p>

<p>Whiscash has the pleasure of wielding what is probably the best typing in the tier, and one of the better stat distributions. Offensive Whiscash is generally a Choice Band tank, with a lot of EVs pumped into HP and Attack. STAB Earthquake is beautiful, and Rock Slide and Double-Edge round off the set nicely. Any of Surf, Ice Beam, and Toxic will usually fill out the rest of the set. An offensive RestTalk set is also possible, as it lets Whiscash tank a few attacks and retaliate even when it's sleeping. A specially attacking tank is also possible and something to be aware of.</p>

<h2>Defensive Threats</h2>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/dewgong.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/dewgong"><strong>Dewgong </strong></a><br />
Typing: Water / Ice<br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 70 Atk / 80 Def / 70 SpA / 95 SpD / 70 Spe<br />
Ability: Thick Fat</p>

<p>The resident bulky Water-type of the tier. The Ice sub-typing doesn't do Dewgong a whole lot of favors due to Hitmonchan and Rock-types being so prevalent in the tier. However, Dewgong's special bulk is immense, meaning it has an easy time checking even the Grass-types in the tier. Dewgong will usually be wielding one or both of Surf and Ice Beam, with the rest of the set tailored to what the team needs. RestTalk is most common to ensure that it can stick around and simply wall the threats it needs to, with other sets ranging from faster support sets with Encore, Toxic, and Perish Song being possibilites. Perish Song in particular makes Dewgong one of the best Calm Mind Chimecho counters available. Physically defensive sets are less common due to the Ground- and Fighting-type weakness, but Surf, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Grass absolutely shred apart many of the Choice Band users in the tier, and Dewgong naturally outspeeds most of them if they're not running any Speed themselves.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/kecleon.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/kecleon"><strong>Kecleon </strong></a><br />
Typing: Normal<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 90 Atk / 70 Def / 60 SpA / 120 SpD / 40 Spe<br />
Ability: Color Change</p>

<p>Kecleon's Special Defense is quite simply incredible, and that allows it to counter nearly every Special attacking threat in the tier head-on. Color Change can sometimes end up biting it in the butt; however, it actually does it a huge favor in most cases as it forces the opponent to switch attacking moves or simply not even leave a dent in Kecleon. Kecleon is one of the best Plusle and Chimecho counters available, and about the only true Haunter counter as well. Its movepool is also gigantic, meaning the support or attacking moves it wields are highly unpredictable. Shadow Ball is usually a given though, with Thunder Wave, Toxic, Body Slam, and Focus Punch also being common. Rarely, Kecleon will go on the offensive with a Choice Band + Trick set, though its constant type changing will usually leave it without a decent STAB move to use, and its poor physical bulk is easily preyed upon.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/lairon.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/lairon"><strong>Lairon </strong></a><br />
Typing: Rock / Steel<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 90 Atk / 140 Def / 50 SpA / 50 SpD / 40 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sturdy / Rock Head</p>

<p>Lairon is one of those that looks far better on paper than in practice. With an immunity to Poison, and what's essentially an immunity to Rock-, Ghost-, Bug-, Flying-, and Normal-type attacks, Lairon, at first glance, looks like one of the best physical walls available. However, those types of attacks are almost always paired with Ground- or Fighting-type attacks, both of which Lairon just crumbles from. Lairon also doesn't bring a whole lot to the table apart from switching into a few types for free. Roar and Toxic are commonplace, with Double-Edge, Rock Slide, Hidden Power Steel, and Earthquake filling out the rest of the set.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/lickitung.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/lickitung"><strong>Lickitung </strong></a><br />
Typing: Normal<br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 55 Atk / 75 Def / 60 SpA / 75 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Abilities: Own Tempo / Oblivious</p>

<p>Lickitung's defenses are just barely passable enough to make use of its access to Wish. Lickitung is about the only Pokemon with access to the move in NU and definitely the bulkiest, giving it certain opportunities to set it up and pass it to a partner unlike Minun or Plusle. Lickitung will typically be specially defensive, though physically defensive spreads are possible. Body Slam, Seismic Toss, and Toxic are usually seen with Wish and Protect. Lickitung's movepool is quite simply astounding, but it just doesn't have the offensive stats to make use of any of it.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/magcargo.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/magcargo"><strong>Magcargo </strong></a><br />
Typing: Fire / Rock<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 50 Atk / 120 Def / 80 SpA / 80 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Abilities: Magma Armor / Flame Body</p>

<p>Magcargo's typing is interesting. Horrible weaknesses to Rock-, Ground-, Fighting-, and Water-type attacks prevent it from doing a whole lot in the tier, but it does switch into Normal- and Flying-type attacks with ease. The main thing Magcargo has going for it are its STAB Fire Blast and Rock Slide, which cuts through a number of Pokemon in the tier, and its ability Flame Body (though it can really bite it in the butt if it accidentally burns Raticate). Magcargo actually makes for an interesting anti-lead to limit both Glalie and Roselia to just one layer of Spikes. Apart from its STAB moves, Selfdestruct is most definitely a possibility, with Yawn, Toxic, and Hidden Power Grass also being present on many of its sets.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/mawile.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/mawile"><strong>Mawile </strong></a><br />
Typing: Steel<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 85 Atk / 85 Def / 55 SpA / 55 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Abilities: Intimidate / Hyper Cutter</p>

<p>Mawile looks god-awful on paper, but in practice it's actually not too bad. Intimidate actually beefs up its Defense to a pretty acceptable level, and when backed by a Steel typing, Mawile has an easy enough time switching into many of the Choice Band-wielding Normal- and Flying-types in the tier. With Intimidate, Mawile can even tank an Earthquake or Fighting-type attack if need be. Once in, Mawile actually has a number of tools at its disposal. Hidden Power Steel is usually a given. Baton Pass combined with one or both of Substitute and Swords Dance is also common. Toxic, Taunt, and Focus Punch are also general possibilities to be aware of. Mawile is a very versatile team supporter and will almost always see use on defensive teams.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/metang.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/metang"><strong>Metang </strong></a><br />
Typing: Steel / Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 75 Atk / 100 Def / 55 SpA / 80 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Ability: Clear Body</p>

<p>There's little reason to use Metang over Mawile in most cases, though the beefier Special Defense can come in handy. There is no typical Metang set and it will usually just be tailor-made into what works best for the team it's on. Meteor Mash, Shadow Ball, Earthquake, and Explosion separate it from Mawile offensively, and Light Screen and Reflect are some neat tools defensively. RestTalk is a very real possibility to turn Metang into a defensive wall. Toxic may also be a common sight on Metang to simply rack up passive damage.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/pelipper.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/pelipper"><strong>Pelipper </strong></a><br />
Typing: Water / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 50 Atk / 100 Def / 85 SpA / 70 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Ability: Keen Eye</p>

<p>Pelipper stands as one of the very few decent defensive Hitmonchan switch-ins. A Rock weakness sucks, but the Fighting-type resist and Ground-type immunity are a real blessing. Pelipper also naturally outspeeds many of the Rock- and Ground-types in the tier, letting it nail them with the appropriate attack. Pelipper will usually be running a RestTalk set, with Surf, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Grass as coverage moves. Flying STAB is another possibility to nail Grass-types and Hitmonchan with, but Pelipper's Attack stat is just dreadful. Like the other defensive Pokemon, Toxic should be expected as well.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/roselia.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/roselia"><strong>Roselia </strong></a><br />
Typing: Grass / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 60 Atk / 45 Def / 100 SpA / 80 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Abilities: Natural Cure / Poison Point</p>

<p>Roselia's stats seem pitiful for a defensive Pokemon, but it's just specially defensive enough to make excellent use of its access to Spikes. Roselia is the defensive counterpart to Glalie, and while Glalie is better suited for most teams, Roselia fits in much better on stall or defensive teams. Its typing also allows it to check the likes of Hitmonchan should it come down to that. Apart from Spikes, Roselia will typically be using Stun Spore, Leech Seed, or Toxic to spread status. It also has access to Aromatherapy, letting it fill the role of cleric on stall teams (it also helps that Roselia is essentially immune to status thanks to Natural Cure as well). To top it off, Roselia isn't a punk when it comes to offense, wielding a surprisingly strong Giga Drain or Hidden Power Grass for STAB. It's also probably the best user of SubSeed in the tier so watch out for that.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/shelgon.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/shelgon"><strong>Shelgon </strong></a><br />
Typing: Dragon<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 95 Atk / 100 Def / 60 SpA / 50 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Ability: Rock Head</p>

<p>Defensive Dragon typing is awesome in the tier, and while Shelgon will usually be running an offensive Dragon Dance or Choice Band set, it's perfectly capable of running a defensive RestTalk set to wall a large portion of the tier. Toxic and DragonBreath are great for spreading status, and Roar can easily rack up Spikes damage. Double-Edge and Brick Break will usually be used as offensive moves even on defensive sets. Although Shelgon can't really counter the likes of Choice Band Hitmonchan or Relicanth as they simply hit too hard, Shelgon can easily out-tank most other defensive Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/swalot.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/swalot"><strong>Swalot </strong></a><br />
Typing: Poison<br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 73 Atk / 83 Def / 73 SpA / 83 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sticky Hold / Liquid Ooze</p>

<p>Swalot's mixed bulk is simply incomparable in the tier, and it is most definitely one of the best defensive Pokemon available. On top of its great bulk, Swalot's typing lends it to being one of, if not the best, Hitmonchan switch-ins, as well as one to most other physically offensive Pokemon in the tier. The Earthquake weakness brings down Swalot's effectiveness slightly, but it's so defensive that it can easily tank one and retaliate appropriately. Apart from its massive bulk, Swalot's movepool is extensive, letting it play a variety of supportive roles on a team. Earthquake and Sludge Bomb are the most common attacking moves, Explosion will almost always make an appearance on the set, and Yawn, Toxic, and Encore are great disruptive moves available to it. A RestTalk set is also common, letting it absorb status and attacks from a whole slew of Pokemon. Lesser seen moves include Ice Beam, Counter, Fire Punch, Giga Drain, and ThunderPunch. Of all the defensive Pokemon to consider when choosing  your attacking movepool, always keep Swalot in mind.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/tangela.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/tangela"><strong>Tangela </strong></a><br />
Typing: Grass<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 55 Atk / 115 Def / 100 SpA / 40 SpD / 60 Spe<br /> 
Ability: Chlorophyll</p>

<p>While Sunny Day Tangela is hard to pass up, defensive Tangela deserves a mention as it is one of the more physically defensive Pokemon available that isn't weak to any of Ground-, Rock-, Fighting-, Grass-, or Water-type moves. Defensive Tangela will usually be running both Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, and possibly Leech Seed in the mix. Hidden Power Grass or Giga Drain will be used for STAB, with the occasional Hidden Power Fire or Ice used for coverage if Giga Drain is chosen.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/whiscash.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/whiscash"><strong>Whiscash </strong></a><br />
Typing: Water / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 110 HP / 78 Atk / 73 Def / 76 SpA / 71 SpD / 60 Spe<br /> 
Ability: Oblivious</p>

<p>Whiscash's mixed defenses are some of, if not the best, in the tier. Defensive Whiscash is the definition of wall, and it's incredibly hard to crack or break through without a Grass-type attack. RestTalk is usually the name of the game, with Earthquake or Surf (or both) used as STAB to ward off other defensive Pokemon. Most defensive teams will simply not have a way to crack open defensive Whiscash apart from Roselia or Tangela, making them extremely predictable to pick off with either Toxic or Ice Beam. Without a phazing move defensive Whiscash can become setup bait, but be warned that it does have access to Tickle.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/rs/wigglytuff.png"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/rs/pokemon/wigglytuff"><strong>Wigglytuff </strong></a><br />
Typing: Normal<br />
Base Stats: 140 HP / 70 Atk / 45 Def / 75 SpA / 50 SpD / 45 Spe<br /> 
Ability: Cute Charm</p>

<p>There is little reason to use Wigglytuff over either Kecleon or Lickitung, but it does have a couple of tricks up its sleeves to separate itself from them. Of main note is its access to Wish; which while Lickitung may be a better user of it overall due to its slightly better defenses, it will still probably be a main fixture of most Wigglytuff sets. Counter is move number one to be very wary of around Wigglytuff, as basically any physical move that doesn't KO it will be an instant KO right back. Wigglytuff also isn't a pushover when it comes to offense either, having access to an absolutely incredible movepool and decent mixed offensive stats. Double-Edge and Return are there for STAB, with Brick Break and Shadow Ball available for physical coverage and Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Flamethrower available for special coverage. Thunder Wave and Toxic are also there for status moves, and Light Screen and Reflect can also make an appearance on support sets.</p>
