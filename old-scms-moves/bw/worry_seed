Changes the target's ability to Insomnia.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Causes the target's ability to become Insomnia. Fails if the target's ability is Insomnia, Multitype, or Truant. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user. The effect is lost if the target switches out.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Worry Seed can be handy at robbing some Pokemon of their valuable abilities. It can cripple Pokemon that are reliant on their abilities, such as Multiscale Dragonite. Nonetheless, Worry Seed can only work as a gimmick and does not have much competitive value. The foe afflicted with Worry Seed can just switch out and come back later, making efforts to swap its ability futile. Furthermore, many Pokemon can still function well without their abilities, which makes using Worry Seed a waste of moveslot most of the time.</p>
