<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to paralyze the target.</p> 

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Discharge is, among those moves with 100% accuracy, the Electric-type attack with the greatest chance to induce paralysis, so is better used on more bulky sets where the benefits of the increased paralysis chance are most felt, with defensive Zapdos and Porygon2 being perfect examples. It has a reasonably good distribution amongst Electric-types, so can fill in for a STAB move, and can be used on lots of different Pokemon that also benefit from the increased paralysis chance, serving as a coverage move option for them as well. Its power is also decent, however offensive Pokemon will almost always prefer Thunderbolt for the increased power, as relying too heavily on a 30% chance rate is unwise.</p>
