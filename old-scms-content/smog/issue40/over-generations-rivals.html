<h2>Introduction</h2>
<img src="/smog/issue40/therivals.png" alt="" class="float-right"/>
<p>Rivals are a big part of the story in all of the mainstream Pok&eacute;mon games. They have the ability to change the pacing of the game, as they can appear anytime and anywhere between the beginning and end of the game to either help you out or challenge you to a battle. Rivals can provide the motivation that drives you to become stronger and makes you want to be the very best like no one ever was. Still, what's interesting about the rival character is that the rival is portrayed differently in each new generation and remake, leaving a lot to the imagination when thinking about what the rivals will be like in future games. In this article, we'll be looking at each rival, learning about their histories, personalities, and relevance to their respective games.</p>

<h2>Gary</h2>
<p>We start this off with none other than the original rival himself. He goes by many names, such as Gary, Blue, Green, the grandson of Professor Oak, and other names not appropriate to say here, but most refer to him simply as Gary Oak. Gary is a character who is bursting with confidence, not only because he's a skilled trainer, but also because he happens to be the grandson of Professor Oak, so he has a good deal of knowledge about Pok&eacute;mon. Due to all of this, Gary developed a superiority complex, often exerting a high-and-mighty attitude and thinking that he's better at Pok&eacute;mon than you in every way, and he won't hesitate to try and prove it when given the chance, which is literally every time you see him. While Gary isn't the best trainer, he certainly does know what he's doing with his team, straying from the Gym Leader standard and actually varying his team in terms of types, so you likely won't be sweeping his whole team with just a single Pok&eacute;mon.</p>
<p>There are a few things that make Gary such a memorable rival. Unlike other rivals, Gary starts battling you the minute you get your new Pok&eacute;mon, and he will constantly bug you on your journey right up until the end of the game. In fact, Gary holds the title of most story-related rival battles in the game, with eight battles throughout the whole story. Gary is also a good rival in the sense that he's always one step ahead of you. Yup, every single encounter with Gary involves him either waiting for you or leaving the place you're about to enter. He even becomes the Champion before you do, which drives the rivalry aspect home and fuels your desire to beat him. But what really makes Gary such a good rival is his personality. Basically, Gary thinks he's the hottest thing to happen since Hot Pockets were invented, better than everyone at everything, and clearly the kind of guy who'll rub it in your face if he wins. Now tell me, does anyone want to lose to a guy like that? Of course not! I know if I lost to a guy like that, I'd never be able to look at myself in the mirror ever again, so I want to be the best I can be and beat him to a bloody pulp. And when you finally knock this guy off his horse, it's one of the best feelings in the game, even better than getting a Gym badge, especially when you beat him as the Champion. This ability to make a player want to improve themselves in order to not lose this jerk is really what makes Gary so memorable, and it's something that isn't seen in the rivals as of late. Most other rivals feel more like friends who battle you for fun, so losing to them wouldn't be such a bad thing. But Gary's ego inspires you, or even compels you, to train your team and keep this guy in check: a feeling that almost none of the other rivals can evoke.</p>

<h2>Silver</h2>
<p>Silver is known as the cruelest and darkest rival in Pok&eacute;mon history, and it's rather easy to see why. Silver sees Pok&eacute;mon as a means to an end, as tools to be used to achieve his ambitions and thrown away when their usefulness has diminished. Silver has interest only in the very strongest of Pok&eacute;mon and has no patience with weak Pok&eacute;mon, and he will even go out of his way to belittle Pok&eacute;mon weaker than his own. He's even gone as far as to say that Pok&eacute;mon that are unable to battle, like the sick Ampharos at Olivine City, should just be discarded and left to die. But Silver isn't limited to criticizing just Pok&eacute;mon, as he won't hesitate to call out humans on their weakness either; he despises Team Rocket for the fact that they're a bunch of weaklings. Calling Silver power-hungry is also pretty reasonable, seeing as he kidnapped one of the starters at Professor Elm's lab and tried searching for legendary Pok&eacute;mon. However, he's too proud to admit defeat after losing to you, often saying something along the lines of "beginners's luck" and throwing a petty insult your way as he leaves the scene.</p>
<p>What makes Silver notable as a rival is, much like Gary, his attitude. This man treats Pok&eacute;mon like trash if he finds them to be weak and only gives a crap about strong Pok&eacute;mon. Because of this, Silver is very reminiscent of a villain, so the thought of losing to the villain is never a pleasant one. Silver also has part of his backstory explained in HGSS, revealing that his father is in fact Giovanni, which makes it easy to see where he got his personality from. So on top of being raised by the wrong crowd, Silver's cruel personality grows even crueler after Giovanni disbanded Team Rocket after losing to Red. This sheds some light on his actions throughout the story, as it makes his hatred towards Team Rocket and towards weakness understandable. Nonetheless, Silver goes through some character development somewhere during the second half of the game, as after being defeated by Lance, he's forced to endure a lecture about treating Pok&eacute;mon with care. Silver was in deep denial at first, but as time passes by, he starts to take Lance's words into consideration, and then he begins to change for the better after losing to you at Victory Road. After that, Silver tries to act in a more friendly manner, showing actual sportsmanship and not acting like a complete jerk. Silver, who was once a cold-hearted soul, is trying to shake off his past and act more compassionately towards both people and Pok&eacute;mon alike, which was enough to warrant some newfound respect.</p>

<h2>Brendan/May</h2>
<p>Brendan and May are interesting cases, mainly because you can play as either one of them. When you choose one gender, the opposite gender character will act as your rival, which is pretty interesting on its own. Even though they seem like two different people, their personalities are almost the exact same aside from some slight dialogue differences here and there. As far as their personalities go, they're quite possibly the friendliest rivals in Pok&eacute;mon history, always acting in a kind and respectful way towards you, giving you useful items and tips along your journey and even helping you out whenever you're in a pinch. Your rival's father happens to be Professor Birch, and they help him out with his research by filling in their Pok&eacute;dex, so they've been training Pok&eacute;mon a little longer than you. Your rival often acts as a mentor early on in the game, giving you advice here and there and testing your battling skills frequently throughout the entirety of the game.</p>
<p>Considering all I've said so far, it should be no surprise that the most memorable quality that Brendan and May have is their friendly attitude. Throughout the entire game, their kindhearted and outgoing personality makes them very likable characters at the beginning of the game, and they feel like true friends near the end. They're also very easy to get along with, as even though you had just arrived at Littleroot Town, they act in a very amiable way towards you and ask to be friends with you. They're also very good sports, as even if they lose a battle, they'll congratulate you on how well you've raised your Pok&eacute;mon, how good at battling you are, and so forth. Their willingness to aid you is also a very notable quality of theirs, as almost every meetup with them is either a battle that nets you experience or an item that helps you along the way; this helpfulness is improved upon in ORAS, so some encounters will result in your team being fully healed, and they'll even offer to travel to other towns with you after certain events take place, which can save a lot of time. But unlike other rivals, they decide to stop challenging you and go back home to work on the Pok&eacute;dex for their dad, so you feel a bit of sadness when they admit defeat and head back home, which shows how much they meant to you as a friend. However, this is changed in ORAS, as after you complete your journey and become Champion, your rival will challenge you to one more battle for old time's sake.</p>

<h2>Barry</h2>
<p>One of the most energetic and borderline annoying rivals to date, Barry speeds in as one of the most sugar-high characters in any Pok&eacute;mon game. Barry is always in a rush, often bumping into you due to him running too fast for his own good, and he will act like a grump whenever he has to wait for you and will threaten to sue you for being late. He may be hyper and impatient, but he's also your childhood friend whom you grew up with, and he does have enough of a kind heart to help you out on your journey here and there. Barry is very dedicated to training his team and becoming more like his father, Palmer, so he constantly trains and tries out different strategies to hone his battling skills. Barry is also quite involved with the story, helping out Professor Rowan with his research and fighting alongside you against Team Galactic, among other things. Barry is one of the more dedicated rivals in the Pok&eacute;mon franchise, always trying to better himself and his team, and that really shows throughout the game.</p>
<p>Throughout the story, Barry develops as a character much like how a child would grow up into an adult, leaving the town he grew up in for so many years and learning just how enjoyable and rough the world can be. Barry starts off with a happy-go-lucky attitude, acting like he'll be the Champion after a few push-ups and protein shakes, which represents the child stage of his journey. As the journey progresses, Barry soon realizes that he has to really commit to his training to reach his goal, and he starts trying out different playstyles and doing some serious training along the way, which is what we could consider the teenager-esque attitude. This character development takes a sharp turn after Barry loses to Jupiter and fails to protect Uxie, as he feels shame at losing to someone with ill intent and failing to protect something important. This was an important wake-up call for Barry, as this made him rethink his reasons for training, leading him to mature into a more adult-like figure.</p>

<h2>N</h2>
<p>N, also known as Natural Harmonious Gropius, is one of three rivals in BW and indeed a mysterious case, as both his personality and his history are quite intriguing. As a child, N grew up in the woods among Pok&eacute;mon who were abused and mistreated by humans, which caused him to develop a resentment for humanity. In fact, his resentment for humanity is so extreme that he attempts to bring one of Unova's legendary Pok&eacute;mon back to life in an attempt to separate humans from Pok&eacute;mon. This childhood is also what led him to gain the ability to communicate with Pok&eacute;mon, which he'll show you by asking your Pok&eacute;mon how they feel about you every once in a while during your journey. N is naive and innocent like a child, though that's to be expected given his past experiences, and this is also why he doesn't feel that his desire to separate humans from Pok&eacute;mon is going too far.</p>
<p>What makes N notable as a rival is his... well everything, really. First, his role in the game as the king of Team Plasma and one of two destined trainers to command one of Unova's legendary Pok&eacute;mon is something shared with no other rival. N's role isn't just that of a rival; he's one of the main antagonists, and this game makes it quite clear. Unlike Silver, who acts like a third party of sorts, N is the very king of Team Plasma, the big villain if you will, acting as a very strong influence to the game's story and pacing. Both N's backstory and his character development are unique and interesting, as he's made out to be the chosen hero destined to change Unova, only to be defeated and cast aside by Ghetsis. N's whole world came crashing down on him when he found out that Ghetsis was only using him for his own ambitions. But at the end of the day, N saw the error of his ways and tried to atone for his actions as he learned more about the world, taking the bad with the good and seeing humanity in a new light.</p>

<h2>Cheren</h2>
<p>Cheren is the second of three rivals in BW, is one of your childhood friends, and is what you could call the bookworm rival. Cheren isn't shy about showing off his knowledge about all things Pok&eacute;mon-related, and he even becomes a teacher when he grows up to teach the new generation about Pok&eacute;mon. Though he tries to show respect towards others, he can show off his knowledge in a rude way at times, such as by cutting Professor Juniper off as she explains the Pok&eacute;dex to everyone, which also shows a bit of an impatient side. Cheren is also determined and somewhat ambitious, as his dream is to become the Champion someday, and he trains vigorously to reach that goal. As BW features a "truths and ideals" theme, Cheren represents ideals, such as wanting to become strong and become the Champion, but he can also get lost in his ambitions and forget why he started chasing them in the first place, which was clear when Alder asked Cheren why he wanted to become Champion, only to get a response filled with uncertainty.</p>
<p>Cheren is a memorable trainer for his dedication and persistence, as he often tests his skills against you whenever the two of you meet up. After every Gym battle starting from the second Gym, Cheren will say that he got the same badge as you and wants to see if he's gotten better than you. Cheren's consistent nature is very becoming of a rival, as he pushes you to become an even stronger trainer, and losing to you only makes him even more determined to train. But as Alder questioned his motives, Cheren was unable to answer, and he slowly started to realize that he shouldn't be the strongest just for the sake of being the strongest and decided to look for that reason during his journey.</p>

<h2>Bianca</h2>
<p>Introducing the only female rival whose gender isn't determined by the player's gender, Bianca is more of a supporter than a rival. Bianca is a spirited and cheerful girl who can be both reserved yet strong-willed, as even when things aren't going too well for her, she's not one to quit or back down. Bianca's strong-willed personality is best seen when acting defiantly towards her father, who refuses to let his daughter go on a journey out of fear for her safety. Bianca is known to be protective of her friends, often offering to be a bodyguard to those around her. Keeping up with the "truths and ideals" theme of BW, Bianca represents truth, since she's often thought she could be something, only to fail at it, and thus has a hard time determining what she should be in life.</p>
<p>What makes Bianca a memorable rival is her character development. She starts off as a klutzy girl without a care in the world, but then goes on a journey to grow up and learn what it's like to be an adult. Bianca has a positive attitude at first when she tries to keep up with you and Cheren, but she slowly starts to lose confidence as a trainer along the way. After her Munna was stolen from Team Plasma and she was protected by Iris, Bianca started to feel a little weak, and while she tried to shake off her doubt, she eventually came to realize that she wasn't going to be a powerful trainer like you or Cheren. Her father tried to take her back home, but she still had enough determination to continue her journey, and she even made up with her father. She supports people whenever she can, often giving you items as gifts. Bianca tries her best to do whatever she can to find out what her talent is and how she can help people out.</p>

<h2>Hugh</h2>
<p>Hugh is your childhood friend whom you grew up with in your hometown, and he started his trainer career before you did. Hugh is energetic and impatient, but he has a good heart and cares about his friends and family. However, he can also be very blunt and straightforward when his emotions run high, and he can act critically even when it isn't all that necessary, such as yelling at a Herdier's owner for being irresponsible and careless for losing sight of it. Hugh is a loyal friend who won't hesitate to ask for your assistance when trouble starts up, just like how he won't hesitate to step in when you find yourself in a predicament. Hugh cares deeply for Pok&eacute;mon, treasuring them like they're family, so whenever Team Plasma is seen or even mentioned, Hugh's temper often shows.</p>
<p>What makes Hugh such an interesting character is his backstory and character development. The way he can act so harshly at times isn't just because of a short temper, but because he cares so deeply for Pok&eacute;mon; this was caused by Team Plasma stealing his sister's Purrloin, which was meant to be a gift to her from their late grandfather, while being unable to do anything to prevent this kidnapping from happening. Since then, Hugh vowed to protect his family and Pok&eacute;mon with his life and trains hard to never lose to Team Plasma again. As you could guess, this traumatic past led to Hugh developing a strong hatred towards Team Plasma, and this hatred is so intense that he even gives the cold shoulder towards the reformed Team Plasma grunts who are trying to make up for their crimes, though Hugh does wind up opening up to them as time passes by. Hugh will often test his skills against yours, and he's a great sport about losing, saying that he can count on you to watch his back when he needs it. Hugh's journey for his sister's Purrloin is also pretty saddening, especially when he finds it fully evolved and acting no better than a wild Pok&eacute;mon ready to attack him. Watching the scene, you could just feel the tension in the game as Hugh stared at what was supposed to be his sister's Pok&eacute;mon, the sadness that he must have felt, and the anger towards Team Plasma.</p>

<h2>Calem/Serena</h2>
<p>As the final rivals to be discussed in this article, Calem and Serena are very reminiscent of Brendan and May, both for the fact that the character that becomes your rival is based on your gender and for their friendly personalities. Calem and Serena are very mature and level-headed characters, always keeping their cool even in sticky situations and acting like young adults. They both have a very strong sense of justice, as they aren't afraid to go up against Team Flare when needed, and they'll also help you out when you're in trouble. They are also quite generous as rivals, giving you both helpful advice and useful items as you progress on your journey. They have a competitive nature to them, often battling with or against you to test their skills. They try to set themselves apart from other trainers, trying to win as often as possible to make a name for themselves.</p>
<p>What makes Calem and Serena enjoyable characters is their friendliness and competitiveness towards you. You first meet them as they're waiting for you at your front door, and they're excited to meet you, their new neighbor, and wish to become friends with you. As you progress through the story, you soon learn that they wish to find something in the world that will set themselves apart from other trainers. They'll often challenge you to battles, as they think defeating you is the best way to become stronger, but the more you beat them, the more you can feel their frustration from not being able to win. At some point in the game, they come to realize that they don't need to make a name for themselves, as each person in the world is unique, and they decide to have battles not for the sake of getting stronger, but to understand the bonds between trainers and Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There have been many different takes on the rival character as the generations pass by, many of whom have unique and differing personalities and preferences, and seeing how the rival character is done with each new installment to the series is something that many fans adore. There are so many kinds of rivals, and there's so much room for more variety in the future, so it can be exciting to learn about a new rival. But the one thing that all rivals have in common is their influence on their respective games, which is the biggest reason why some rival characters are so beloved, and seeing how different rivals impact the game in different ways can really show Game Freak's creativity at times. The fun thing is they won't be done creating rival characters so long as the Pok&eacute;mon series still lives.</p>
