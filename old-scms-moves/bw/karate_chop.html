Has a high critical hit rate.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a critical hit rate one stage higher than normal. Assuming there are no other critical hit modifiers in play, this move has a 1/8 chance to get a critical hit instead of a 1/16 chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Not a useful move competitively speaking. Low Base Power and bad distribution essentially kills any use it could have had. With only five fully-evolved users available and every single one of them having a better option for a Fighting-type move, there is literally no reason whatsoever to use it. At all.</p>
