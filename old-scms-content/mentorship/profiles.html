He has also written a few articles for the Smog, some being the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/smog/issue22/starters">"About the Starters"</a> <a href="http://www.smogon.com/smog/issue23/starters">series of</a> <a href="http://www.smogon.com/smog/issue24/starters">articles</a> with sandshrewz.

            <strong>Hobbies:</strong> Major gamer here. Spends most of his time playing various games; however, Pokémon is not the favorite videogame series. That would be the The Legend of Zelda and the Super Smash Bros. series—Pokémon is tied second with Fire Emblem and (the Naughty Dog era) Crash Bandicoot series of games. He's a huge Nintendo fan in general, playing basically every series they release.<br />
            <strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> He's not only Swedish, but also Spanish (Swedish mother / Spanish father); however, he can barely speak any Spanish. He's also, as far as he knows, the first Swede to get badged.<br />
