[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user enters a semi-invulnerable state for the turn the move is used. The next turn, the user exits that state and deals damage to the target. Has a 30% chance to paralyze the target. If the move is prevented from being used after the user has entered the semi-invulnerable state, then the entire move is canceled, but PP is still deducted. The user cannot make a move between turns. If the user holds the item Power Herb, the user will not enter the semi-invulnerable state and simply deal damage to the target that turn. The user can still be hit by Gust, Hurricane, Sky Uppercut, Smack Down, Thunder, Twister, and Whirlwind while in the semi-invulnerable state, or if it was previously targeted by Mind Reader or Lock-On, or if the opponent has No Guard. Gust and Twister strike with double their usual Base Power when the target is in the semi-invulnerable state. The user will still take sandstorm and hail damage on the turn it is in the semi-invulnerable state. This move cannot be used while Gravity is in effect.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>As with all two-turn moves, this move is competitively risky; the move's poor accuracy does not help in this respect either, though the move does pack reasonable power and an excellent secondary effect. Generally speaking, only one Pokemon should use this move: Gyarados. Backed by STAB and Gyarados's excellent Attack stat, this move can do tremendous damage and has fantastic neutral coverage alongside Waterfall, and since Bounce is Gyarados's only option for a Flying-type STAB move, there isn't an awful lot of choice in this area. Just remember, however, that should the opponent see Bounce coming, they can obtain a free switch or free setup with the user forced to stay in. Also, it should be remembered that Pokemon with Protect can easily take advantage of Bounce, though Gyarados can often deal with this through the use of Taunt.</p>
