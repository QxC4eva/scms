[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 20% chance to confuse the target. Damage is boosted to 1.2x by the ability Iron Fist.</p> 

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Even though Dizzy Punch seems to be a good move on its own, and there is a fairly decent chance for its added effect to occur, it's not used on the competitive scene, because it's outclassed in terms of raw damage output by other more powerful Normal-type moves, namely Return and Frustration. There is no recommended situation where this move would be a better option.</p>
