Summons a sandstorm for five turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This move generates the sandstorm weather condition for five turns. Any other weather conditions will be cleared when this move is used. While under the effects of sandstorm, all Pokemon that are not of the Rock-, Ground-, or Steel-type or have the abilities Magic Guard, Overcoat, Sand Force, Sand Rush, or Sand Veil will lose 1/16 of their health at the end of every turn. Rock-types gain a boost to their Special Defense of 50%. Pokemon who have access to the Sand Veil ability obtain a 20% evasion boost. The move SolarBeam will only hit with 1/2 of its usual Base Power. Pokemon who possess the Sand Rush ability will have their Speed doubled. Pokemon who have the Sand Force ability are granted a 30% boost to all Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-type moves. Synthesis, Moonlight, and Morning Sun only recover 1/4 of the Pokemon's maximum health. Weather Ball changes into a Rock-type move with 100 Base Power. If the user of this move holds the item Smooth Rock, the duration of the weather becomes eight turns rather than five. If Sandstorm is used while the sandstorm weather condition is already active, the move will fail.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sandstorm is one of those weather conditions that can be exploited to gain the upper advantage in battle. A surprising fact is that sandstorm was once an inferior weather condition dwelling at the same level as Hail. But ever since the fourth generation arrived, sandstorm increased its importance as a separate theme strategy to the same level as Rain Dance and Sunny Day, because the 50% increase in Special Defense for Rock-types makes it possible to set up sandstorm with relative ease. However, it is only in generation five that offensive sandstorm teams have become ubiquitous; infamous sandstorm abusers such as Landorus are able to perform their tasks more effectively under sandstorm, as Landorus can deal more damage with its Sand Force ability, and in the lower tiers, Stoutland can use the Sand Rush ability, which increases its Speed to the point where it is impossible to outrun. However, the move Sandstorm itself is obsolete because Tyranitar or Hippowdon can conjure up a permanent sandstorm weather condition with their ability, Sand Stream, and you should never try to take advantage of sandstorm without them in tow.</p>
