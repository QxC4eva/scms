<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3483472">UU Team Study</a></strong> is a project that attempts to unite the community while improving the overall quality of the UU playerbase by studying the art of teambuilding at the highest level.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3479974">Counter This Threat</a></strong> focuses on a major threat in the UU metagame and asks users to describe sets that can beat it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3472433">NU and RU Pokemon in UU</a></strong> is a thread that takes a look at Pokemon from the lower tiers and determines their worth in UU. This is a great resource for players who are looking to incorporate some creativity in their teams, but are unsure of which RU and NU pokemon are viable in UU.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3472715">Taking a look at BL</a></strong> thread is for discussing the impact BL Pokemon would have in the current UU tier. This thread is strictly for theorymon, it is in no way a step towards re-testing BL Pokemon in UU.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/the-next-best-thing.3477626/#post-4542878">The Next Best Thing...</a></strong> thread is an ongoing project that encourages players from all experience levels to create new sets for already on-site Pokemon. This link will take you to the sets that were considered to be the best entries per round, and maybe give you some unique team ideas.</p>

<h2>Darwinian Theory</h2>
