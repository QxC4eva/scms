Overview
########

- Very bulky compared to other attackers, can set up 101 HP Substitutes.
- Can differentiate itself from Kyurem-B with a higher base 130 Special Attack stat.
- Possesses the strongest Ice Beam in the tier.
- Pressure can come in handy against low-PP moves such as Stone Edge and Gyro Ball.
- Usable (but not great) base 95 Speed.
- Typing is a double-edged sword: great STABs and handy resistances, but has weaknesses to commonly seen Fighting-, Steel-, Rock-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type moves.
- Faces extreme competition from Kyurem-B, who is much more flexible and versatile, gains much better coverage, and has better all-around stats.
- Requires hazard removal to function well.
- Very bland movepool, can't do much more than SubRoost.


SubRoost
########
name: SubRoost
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Roost
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Earth Power
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 56 HP / 200 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

- Substitute protects from status and greatly eases prediction between Ice Beam and Earth Power.
- Roost allows Kyurem to stay healthy, continue making substitutes, and even wall some defensive Pokemon
- STAB Ice Beam provides a powerful attack and good super effective coverage
- Earth Power is basically mandatory as it gets a heavy hit on Ice resists like Heatran and provides extremely great coverage together with Ice Beam.

Set Details
========

- 56 HP EVs to lessen Stealth Rock damage and create 101 HP substitutes.
- Max speed to tie with neutral-natured Kyurem-B.
- A Modest nature adds further to Kyurem's power.
- Leftovers is necessary to slowly replenish Kyurem's health after making a substitute and lessen the need to use Roost.

Usage Tips
========

- Kyurem should be sent out against Pokemon that cannot hurt it much, such as Rotom-W, or Pokemon that are severely threatened by Kyurem's attacks, such as Gliscor.
- Kyurem should set up a substitute whenever possible, as it limits the number of ways the opponent can deal with Kyurem.
- However, keep in mind Kyurem cannot muscle past its hard counters such as Calm Mind Suicune, making Substitute a bad choice if they are likely to switch in.
- If an attacker with a low-PP move such as Stone Edge or Close Combat switches in, it may be a good idea to stay in and use Substitute a few times depending on the situation.
- Kyurem's health should not be squandered for PP stalling unless Kyurem or a teammate will truly be in a better position because of it.

Team Options
========

- Strong physical attackers like Mega Pinsir and Garchomp to take care of special walls.
- Defog/Rapid Spin users are mandatory, Kyurem has particularly good synergy with Skarmory and Mandibuzz.
- Because Kyurem is powerful but slow compared to other offensive Pokemon, Sticky Web support is helpful but not necessary.
- Kyurem has a bad matchup towards faster offensive teams, so teammates that do not struggle against them are mandatory.
- Kyurem is particularly good against stall teams, so teammates that struggle against stall will appreciate Kyurem.
- Toxic Spikes support is actually very helpful as the majority of Kyurem's switch-ins are grounded.


Other Options
########
 
- Dragon Pulse is an option, but it is redundant with Kyurem's other attacks. The only notable target it hits, Rotom-W, is easily stalled out.
- Glaciate is cool for lowering speed, but most of the time Kyurem would rather have the raw power of Ice Beam.
- Blizzard is a great option if Hail support is provided, as Kyurem is arguably the best Hail attacker.
- Focus Blast to hit Tyranitar and Scizor harder, although it leaves Kyurem completely open to Aegislash.
- Choice Specs is an option, especially in hail, but requires heavy support from teammates due to the amount of switching involved.
- Just about every other possible set (Choice Scarf/Band, mixed, etc.) is done better by Kyurem-B.


Checks & Counters
########

- Faster attackers such as Mega Charizard X/Y with super effective or powerful moves can easily overwhelm Kyurem and prevent it from setting up a substitute.
- Scizor, Tyranitar, Azumarill, Assault Vest Conkeldurr, Assault Vest Excacrill, and other bulky attackers with super effective moves can easily take a hit and hit back hard.
- Special walls stop Kyurem cold, Blissey and Chansey especially.
- Bulky setup sweepers, especilly Water-types (Quiver Dance Volcarona, CroCune, Manaphy, Mega Gyarados).
- Sylveon/Mega Gardevoir with Pixilate Hyper Voice or Infiltrator Noivern (goes through substitute).
- SubDisable Gengar
