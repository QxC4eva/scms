<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Swift Swim would have so much more competitive use if it wasn't banned in combination with <a href="/bw/abilities/drizzle">Drizzle</a> in OU. Both are still allowed, but not both on the same team. Therefore, it's restricted to either <a href="/bw/moves/rain_dance">Rain Dance</a> teams or countering Drizzle teams. If you want to pick a certain Pokemon, take your pick; <a href="/bw/pokemon/kingdra">Kingdra</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/kabutops">Kabutops</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/ludicolo">Ludicolo</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/gorebyss">Gorebyss</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/qwilfish">Qwilfish</a> and many others are all viable users of Swift Swim in rain. It's a shame that <a href="/bw/pokemon/ferrothorn">Ferrothorn</a> exists to put a stop to nearly all of them, hence why they work well in conjunction to get rid of it. It is viable, but really now you have to dedicate a team towards it to use it effectively. In Ubers, Swift Swim has much more competitive use due to no bans regarding Swift Swim and <a href="/bw/pokemon/kyogre">Kyogre</a>'s usage.</p>
