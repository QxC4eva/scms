<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There isn't much reason to use Natural Gift competitively. It has bad distribution, and the fact that the use of the move consumes the held Berry after usage and the relatively low Base Power of the created move are enough to condemn it to disuse. Not to mention that most times the extra coverage move provided by Natural Gift can be provided by the appropriate Hidden Power type. There are better, more well-distributed options that let your Pokemon keep their held item, and those should be the first choices in a competitive environment.</p>
