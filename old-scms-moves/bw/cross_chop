Has a high critical hit rate.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a critical hit rate one stage higher than normal. Assuming there are no other critical hit modifiers in play, this move has a 1/8 chance to get a critical hit instead of a 1/16 chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Cross Chop is a powerful Fighting-type move with a increased chance to land a critical hit. The biggest reason why it is not used more instead of such moves as Close Combat and Drain Punch is its poor accuracy, which can often be troublesome. Both of these alternatives, the most common Fighting-type moves, have 100% accuracy and at least one will be available to almost every Pokemon with Cross Chop regardless. It's a decent move, but unlike its counterpart Stone Edge, there are far better alternatives. You may see it used alongside Ice Punch on Toxicroak or on a mixed Magmortar, but really, this is only because these Pokemon have no better options available.</p>
