
Overview
########

- Gourgeist-S is a great spinblocker with unique Grass/Ghost typing.
- Gourgeist-S is fast, outspeeding and burning Scizor, Mamoswine, Breloom, Dragonite, Excadrill, and Gyarados.
- Frisk and Protect scouts opponents.
- Leech Seed+Will-O-Wisp is really, really annoying.
- Solid physical bulk with resistances like Ground-, Water-, and Electric-types.
- Sub-par special bulk, with weaknesses to Ghost-, Dark-, Fire-, and Ice-types.
- Crippled by status, no good recovery.
- Low offenses, Substitute fodder.
- Crippled by Taunt
- Trevenant and Gourgeist-H are bulkier or have better recovery.


Defensive Spinblocker
########

Name: Defensive Spinblocker
move 1: Will-O-Wisp
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Protect / Seed Bomb
ability: Frisk
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 32 Def / 224 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

- Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and racks up passive damage.
- Leech Seed is your source of healing, good passive damage with Will-O-Wisp and Protect.
- Protect scouts opponent for moves.
- Seed Bomb hits Rotom-W, but Substitute gives a layer of protection.
- Substitute is good to avoid status from Rotom-W and Chansey, which would otherwise cripple you.
- Pain Split can be a decent option for semi-reliable recovery.

Set Details
========

- 224 speed EVs with a Jolly nature outspeeds max speed Kyurem-B. Put the rest into HP and defense.
- Frisk is valuable, as it lets you scout items.
- Leftovers is mandatory as Gourgeist has no reliable healing.

Usage Tips
========

- Don't use Leech Seed or Will-O-Wisp when opponent has Pokemon like Heatran or Mega Venusaur.
- Don't spam Protect; easy to play around.
- Use Frisk to your advantage; switch in on physical attackers you can take.
- Gourgeist-S has speed; if you like bulk more use Gourgeist-H or Trevenant.
- If you run Substitute, use it against Pokemon like Rotom-W and Chansey.
- Go for burns on crucial Pokemon, even if it means sacrificing Gourgeist-S.

Team Options
========

- Gourgeist-S spinblocks Excadrill well, pairs well with hazards. Bisharp is a good partner, discouraging defog too. Gourgeist-S takes Fighting and Ground moves aimed at Bisharp.
- Gourgeist-S is Substitute fodder for Gengar, so be sure to pack a sturdy phazer, such as Heatran or Mandibuzz.
- Gourgeist-S has weak Special Defense, making Tyranitar and Heatran excellent partners. Great type synergy with Tyranitar in particular.
- Gourgeist-S hates status, so Sylveon and Chansey provides wish support and status control while also taking special attacks.
- Have a response to Fire-type sweepers, like Talonflame, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard-X; they can set up on Gourgeist-S freely.

Other Options
########

- Destiny Bond can surprise slower attackers.
- Phantom Force stalls out extra turns of leech seed and burn damage, but is very easy to play around.
- Fire Blast dents Ferrothorn and Scizor, but is weak otherwise.
- Shadow Sneak provides useful priority, but is very weak.
- A Trick + Choice Scarf set with Trick, Destiny Bond, Will-O-Wisp, and Seed Bomb can be used, but is outclassed by Rotom-W.
- Rock Slide hits Fire-type Pokemon, but is still pretty weak.
- Sub-Disable is cool, but other Pokemon do it better.
- Insomnia can be used to ignore Dark Void (and Hypnosis), but neither move is especially common in OU.

Checks & Counters
########

- Fire-types in general are bad, since they can switch in freely and set up or kill. Rotom-H in particular can also grab momentum.
- Strong special attackers can usually KO Gourgeist-S, like Greninja and Gengar.
- Any fast user of substitute beats Gourgeist-S, like Thundurus or Gengar.
- Fast pokemon with Taunt shut it down, like Crobat, Sableye, or Thundurus.
- Gourgeist cannot get past grasses with recovery, such as Trevenant, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi.
- Clefable and Reuniclus set up freely.
