<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is flinched, its Speed is boosted one stage. Does not boost Speed if the user is attacked while charging <a href="/bw/moves/focus_punch">Focus Punch</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The main two Pokemon currently with Steadfast are <a href="/bw/pokemon/lucario">Lucario</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/gallade">Gallade</a>. Lucario can really choose either to use Steadfast or its other ability <a href="/bw/abilities/inner_focus">Inner Focus</a>, as both are viable for it but neither are particularly good or noticeable. Gallade has no other choice but to use Steadfast, but you never really see Gallade anyway. Steadfast is a pretty rare ability but it's around often enough that you will be affected by it from time to time.</p>
