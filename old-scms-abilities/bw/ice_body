[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If hail is the prevailing weather condition, the wielder heals 1/16 of its maximum HP at the end of each turn. In addition, if a non-Ice-type Pokemon has this ability, it will not take damage from hail.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Having an extra <a href="/bw/items/leftovers">Leftovers</a>-esque healing in permanent hail is fantastic for bulky Pokemon that get it, particularly <a href="/bw/pokemon/walrein">Walrein</a>. In fact, Walrein is such a fantastic user of Ice Body that it has developed into one of the most dreaded sets, if set up properly, in competitive history: Stallrein. However, Ice Body is only useful on extremely bulky Pokemon that can make use of the extra recovery like Walrein, and it has to be used on teams with permanent hail, which require either <a href="/bw/pokemon/abomasnow">Abomasnow</a> or <a href="/bw/pokemon/snover">Snover</a> as a teammate. Therefore, Walrein is really the only Pokemon that Ice Body is seen on in competitive play; the other Pokemon that receive it simply aren't bulky enough to make use of it or are in a tier where permanent hail is unavailable.</p>
