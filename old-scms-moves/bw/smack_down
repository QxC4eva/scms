<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Can hit the target even if it is using Bounce, Fly, or Sky Drop, or is under the effect of Sky Drop. If this attack is successful and the target has Levitate, is a Flying-type, or is under the effect of Bounce, Fly, Magnet Rise, or Telekinesis, the effect of Bounce, Fly, Magnet Rise, and Telekinesis ends for the target (if Fly and Bounce end this way, the target does nothing during its attack turn this turn). If the target is a Flying-type that has not used Roost this turn or a Pokemon with the ability Levitate, it loses its immunity to Ground-type attacks and the ability Arena Trap as long as it remains active. During the effect, Magnet Rise fails for the target and Telekinesis fails against the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Besides merely completing the EdgeQuake coverage when used in conjunction with Earthquake, this move has another use in allowing Ground-type sweepers a chance to hit Pokemon that would otherwise wall their primary STAB. For example, despite Rhyperior's power, it is unable to break through Bronzong's defenses in conjunction with Levitate. However, a Smack Down on the turn Bronzong switches in will allow Rhyperior to hit it for super effective damage via Earthquake. It also can see situational usage on Fighting-types that also utilize Earthquake, but this is not preferable as Stone Edge hits Flying-types harder, and many Flying-types take neutral damage from Fighting-type attacks in the first place.</p>
