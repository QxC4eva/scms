Topic Leader Selection
[page]

<p>Once the Topic Leader and Topic Leadership Team Nominations thread has closed and the forum moderation staff has selected the candidates that are qualified for the position, the Topic Leader is chosen. A moderator will open a thread containing an instant-runoff voting poll, in which all CAP community members have the right to vote. A brief summary of the choices contained in the vote is also customary. The voting is conducted in the standard IRV fashion; that is to say that the IRV poll will select the Topic Leader in that single poll, irrespective of majorities. The CAP Project Leader will only vote in the event of a tie.</p>
