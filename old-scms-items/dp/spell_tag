<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises the power of Ghost-type moves 20% when this item is held.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Spell Tag generally does not see much competitive play. This is partly due to the fact that few Pokemon are able to effectively use multiple attacks of the same type. Therefore, most trainers will opt to use items that provide bigger boosts to a wider range of attacks, such as <a href="/dp/items/choice_band">Choice Band</a>, which boosts the power of physical attacks, <a href="/dp/items/choice_specs">Choice Specs</a>, which boosts the power of special attacks, or <a href="/dp/items/life_orb">Life Orb</a>, which boosts the power of both kinds of attacks. Spell Tag does not have side effects, which all three alternative items carry with them.</p>
