<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Focus Blast is the most powerful special Fighting-type move in the game. It is also the least accurate. The move is essential for providing coverage on many special attackers, and its high Base Power makes it a superior choice against bulky special walls such as Tyranitar and Ferrothorn. A prime example is Alakazam, where the coverage that Focus Blast provides alongside its powerful STAB Psychic attacks lets it blow through a large portion of the metagame. However, like Stone Edge, Focus Blast is widely considered one of the worst moves in the game solely because of its awful accuracy. Despite this, Focus Blast sees a lot of use because of the amazing coverage it provides, and many players are willing to take the risk in order to have the chance to achieve important KOs. If the low accuracy of the move is undesirable, Aura Sphere is a excellent substitute on the handful of Pokemon that learn it.</p>
