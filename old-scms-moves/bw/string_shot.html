Lowers target's Speed by 1 stage.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Speed by one stage. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>String Shot is essentially an alternative version of Icy Wind that doesn't do any damage. If the Pokemon in question can learn both, go with Icy Wind as the extra damage helps deal with Focus Sash users and Sturdy Pokemon. Outside of those users, most Pokemon that can use String Shot are either too frail to use it efficiently or would rather be using a status-inducing move.</p>
