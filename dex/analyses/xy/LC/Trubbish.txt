Overview
########
- Trubbish is great at checking many of the top threats in the metagame, while also supporting  the team with hazards
- Access to Sticky Hold +Recycle gives Trubbish excellent survivability with Berry Juice
- Poison-typing allows Trubbish to come in for free on almost all Fighting-type Pokemon and have a free turn to set up Hazards
- High speed makes Trubbish valuable to check major threats in the metagame while also letting it use Spikes often.
- Cannot do anything to Misdreavus, one of the most common Pokemon in the metagame.

Moves
========
- Spikes are Trubbish's utility move and the primary reason to use Trubbish. 
- Recycle allows Trubbish to constantly recover using Berry Juice after it reaches under 50% HP. 
- Gunk Shot is Trubbish's strongest STAB move, though Trubbish's Attack is quite low. 
- Drain Punch lets Trubbish check Pokemon such as Pawniard who are immune to Gunk Shot. 
- Theif is an option over Drain Punch if Pawniard is already covered, as it hits Misdreavus harder than Gunk Shot on the switch. 

Set Details
========
- Max Speed is required to outpace Pokemon such as Pawniard and Dwebble. It is also useful for finishing off weakened Pokemon such as Meditite. 
- Rest of EVs are thrown into bulk, with emphasis on Defense to tank Knock Offs more effectively. 


Usage Tips
========
- Trubbish can be switched into most physical neutral attacks such as Knock Off and set up Spikes. 
- If there is a Misdreavus on the opponents team, it may be a good idea to hold off using Trubbish, as it gets a free set up. 

Team Options
========
- Spikes may be required to set up before Misdreavus is knocked out, meaning a Misdreavus check is basically required. A Pokemon such as Pawniard is not only a good way to check Misdreavus, but also to lure Fighting-types in to get Trubbish turns to set up. Pawniard also has defiant which can take advantage of the opponent using Defog for Trubbish's hazards.
- Late game cleaners such as Tirtouga and Scraggy also enjoy Spikes since they break Magnemite and Dwebbles Sturdy. 
- A Ghost-type to absorb Rapid Spin is also quite useful, since Drilbur essentially has a free switch into Trubbish. 

Other Options
########
- If Spikes are already fit on a team, Toxic Spikes are also a viable option.
- A lure set for Misdreavus with Substitute and Payback can be effective. 
- A special set with Sludge Bomb, Dark Pulse, or Hidden Power Fighting as potential moves along with Recycle and Spikes can be used effectively, especially since it is not as crippled by Will-O-Wisp. 
- An Eviolite set can improve Trubbish's bulk, tanking things such as LO Murkrow's Brave Bird, but it has no recovery outside of its weak Drain Punch.
- Rock Blast is an option allowing it to hurt opposing Dwebble leads hard, and breaking Substitutes.
- Clear Smog can stop set-up sweepers such as non-Substitute Misdreavus and Shell Smash Dwebble.
- Explosion is an option if you want Trubbish to work as a suicide lead. Using Explosion against a slower Defog or Rapid Spin user prevents them removing your hazards.

Checks & Counters
########
- **Ghost-types**: Even with Theif, Misdreavus and Honedge will not be easy to stop from setting up. 
- **Ground-types**: Ground-types can easily KO Trubbish. Diglett has arena trap to trap and KO Trubbish. Drilbur has access to Rapid Spin which removes Trubbish's hazards.
- **Rapid Spin / Defog**: These remove hazards and Trubbish has no way to stop this on its own.
