[SHORT DESC]
Lowers target's accuracy by 1 stage.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's accuracy by one stage. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. When used in-game, Flash will illuminate dark caves. The effect will last until the player exits the cave and then reset when the player enters the cave again.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Flash has little to no competitive use. Using moves that affect accuracy is an ineffective strategy since many players switch their Pokemon out often, resetting the accuracy boosts.</p>
