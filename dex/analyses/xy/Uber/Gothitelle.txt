Overview
########
- Shadow Tag is an amazing ability that makes an otherwise useless Pokemon like Gothitelle extremely dangerous
- Mostly outclassed by Mega Gengar but has key advantages such as not using up Mega slot and being able to setup
- Generally more effective against stallier team types than the other Shadow Tag users in ubers
- Fairly specialized and often reliant on trapping support arceus formes

Moves
========

- Psychic gets the 2HKO on mega scizor at +6 and is stronger in general
- Psyshock helps with Ho-Oh and lets Gothitelle setup alongside and beat CM Arceus formes more often than not
- Calm Mind allows Gothitelle to setup on weaker, specially attacking Pokmon like support Arceus formes
- Rest shrugs off status and lets Gothitelle gather extra boosts
- Trick Room lets Gothitelle take advantage of its mediocre speed to sweep after capping its stats
- Taunt harrasses walls a lot more and can help if your team is weak to spike setters like Skarmory
- Heal Bell can be used to support your team in a status heavy metagame like Ubers
- Magic Coat can be used to surprise Taunt users and hazard setters
- Torment can help it setup easier by stopping support Arceus and other single attacking pokemon from attacking multiple times in a row or using Calm Mind alongside Gothitelle

Set Details
========

- Maximum special bulk eases setup and lets goth setup safely on more targets like Palkia or Scarf Xerneas if Goth can come in for free somewhere (usually after a kill)
- If using Trick Room, running as little speed is possible so that you can move first versus as many things as possible when Trick Room is active
- If using Taunt, opt for a Calm nature, instead, and use 44 speed evs to outrun Skarmory so that you can Taunt it before it can Taunt or use hazards
- If you want to move some of that spdef evs elsewhere, you can opt to run only 40 spdef evs with a calm or sassy nature with the leftover being poured into the stat of your choice. This spread is the minimum required to be able to switch in and setup on support arceus.

Usage Tips
========

- Don't underestimate Gothitelle's bulk, it can even setup on popular Pokemon like Palkia. 
- Don't overestimate its bulk, either, special attackers that run heavy investment like Palkia hit too hard for Gothitelle to switch in directly. Wait for the target to kill off a weakened or otherwise unimportant teammember so that Gothitelle can come in perfectly healthy. Also watch out for phazing moves like Roar or Dragon Tail. 
- Double switching is another way to get in Gothitelle healthy, although much riskier and reliant on you properly reading your opponent's plays.
- Keep in mind Shadow Tag is supposed to crack open defensive cores so that your other pokemon can sweep or clean up the opposing team. Just because Gothitelle uses Calm Mind doesn't mean you should hold it back until it can sweep.
- If using Gothitelle on a Sticky Web team, know that it is impossible to safely keep an Arceus forme under permanent Taunt to prevent Defog so you will have to find a way to replace the lost webs. Trick Room can help in that respect.

Team Options
========

- Gothitelle excels at removing support Arceus formes which are often the defensive backbones for teams. They are also the most common checks to threats like Mega Kangaskhan or Mega Charizard X. Fake Out Mega Kangaskhan also excels against team archetypes that Gothitelle struggles with: harding hitting and fast offensive teams.
- Teams that heavily use hazards also appreciate Gothitelle being able to easily trap support Arceus (who are the most common defog users in the metagame)
- Gothitelle can also trap Palkia making Choice Scarf Kyogre a powerful partner and potential cleaning option.
- If you want to increase the odds of Gothitelle sweeping, teammates like Arceus-Ghost can help put pressure on Dark types like Yveltal and Darkrai and force them to sacrifice themselves to remove the threatening Arceus forme or just leave them with a burn that can add onto formes of passive damage.
- Overall, Gothitelle can trap a large number of threats opening up multiple options for potential sweepers or cleaners to use. Experiment!


Other Options
########

- Reflect can be used to patch Gothitelle's fragile physical defense and help it sweep but Trick Room mostly outclasses this option
- Other coverage moves like Hidden Power Fire or Thunderbolt can be used but Gothitelle's slow speed and fragile physical defense make it difficult for it to pull off a clean sweep without Trick Room and Gothitelle is too weak without boosts to kill a Ferrothorn before it sets up all the hazards it desires
- Sleep Talk may seem like a good option seeing as Gothitelle uses Rest but it is inconsistent in helping Gothitelle aquire additional Calm Mind boosts and may backfire by killing the trapped Pokemon before Gothitelle has finished setting up
- Alternative sets centered around using Toxic can help Gothitelle cripple defensive teams by trapping and forcing the status upon them but overall Gothitelle is better off using a Calm Mind set

Checks & Counters
########

Shadow Tag makes it impossible to counter Gothitelle in the traditional sense of the word as you can't switch out. The only thing you can do is make sure as many Pokemon on your team as possible can't be trapped and run Pokemon that can prevent a potential sweep.

**Ghost-types**: Are immune to trapping abilities like Shadow Tag
**Shed Shell**: Also allow Pokemon to escape from the grips of Shadow Tag
**Phazing**: Using Roar or Dragon Tail on your Pokemon will prevent Gothitelle from being able to setup on them.
**Dark-types**: Yveltal, Darkrai, and Tyranitar help in preventing Gothitelle in sweeping thanks to their immunity to the only attacking move Gothitelle uses.
**Powerful Physical Attackers**: Can help in revenge killing a Gothitelle and cut off its sweep. Ho-Oh and U-Turn Scizor are particularly effective as they have the raw bulk and/or Psychic-type resist to be able to survive one of Gothitelle's attacks and hit back hard.
**Pursuit**: Scizor or Tyranitar can come in after Gothitelle has killed a Pokemon and trap the trapper so that it can't repeat what it did on other Pokemon.
