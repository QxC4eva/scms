[SHORT DESC]
Switches position with another Pokemon on user's side of the field.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user swaps positions with its ally on the far side of the field. Fails if there is no Pokemon at that position, if the user is the only Pokemon on its side, or if the user is in the middle. This move has a priority of +1.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Since Ally Switch doesn't work in single battles, it's somewhat wasted in Smogon's standard metagames. If you're playing unrated triples or doubles, however, it can be a useful move on Pokemon such as Alakazam, though really it is gimmicky at best.</p>
