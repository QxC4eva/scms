<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises the power of Ice-type moves 20% when this item is held.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Although a 20% boost sounds good when coupled with STAB, few Pokemon are able to use NeverMeltIce effectively. Even those whose analyses mention it&mdash;Mamoswine and Weavile&mdash;hardly ever hold it. This is because there aren't many movesets that focus primarily on Ice-type attacks. Most Pokemon would be better off getting their power boosts from more conventional items, such as Life Orb or Choice items. These items boost all of the attacks in a moveset instead of just attacks of one type, making them superior choices over NeverMeltIce.</p>
