<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Removes any negative stat changes to the holder. Consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>White Herb is not a commonly used item, as most stat decreases come as unexpected side-effects of moves, so its effectiveness varies greatly from battle to battle. However, it can come in very handy where the holder is instigating the stat decrease, particularly for that one deadly move, Shell Smash. If the Shell Smash sweeper, such as Cloyster or Omastar, uses Shell Smash, the defensive stat drops are removed by White Herb, giving the sweeper an effective +2 Attack, +2 Special Attack, and +2 Speed with no drawbacks. However, you do miss out on the extra power you would get from Life Orb, which is unfortunate.</p>
