[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Whenever an attack by an opposing Pokemon or an ability from an opposing Pokemon causes a stat stage of the wielder to be reduced, its Attack is raised by 2 stages. Defiant triggers once for each different stat stage reduced.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/braviary">Braviary</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/primeape">Primeape</a> have access to <a href="/bw/moves/superpower">Superpower</a> and Close Combat respectively, but Defiant isn't triggered by self-inflicted stat drops, so this makes the entire ability slightly worse. However, it is still useful for preventing the effects of <a href="/bw/abilities/intimidate">Intimidate</a> for <a href="/bw/pokemon/bisharp">Bisharp</a>, Braviary, and Primeape.</p>
