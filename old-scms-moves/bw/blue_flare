<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 20% chance to burn the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This move is almost certainly the best special Fire-type attack in the game, with excellent power, passable accuracy, and no obvious drawback besides. Unfortunately, this move is currently restricted to Reshiram, Victini, and Smeargle; only the former two are able to cause significant damage with it. In combination with its Dragon-type STAB moves and Turboblaze ability, Reshiram receives perfect neutral coverage with Blue Flare, and thanks to its excellent base 150 Special Attack, can leave a large dent in almost anything. In the same vein, Victini can use its more accurate Blue Flare (thanks to its ability Victory Star) to deal huge damage to its opponents in lower tiers, though it faces some competition with the equally useful V-create.</p>
