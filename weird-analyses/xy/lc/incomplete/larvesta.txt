Moves
========
U-turn excellent momentum grabber and allows Larvesta to pivot around Fighting-types. U-turn also lets it escape from incoming checks and counters.
Flare Blitz hits anything that doesn't resist, hard.
Morning Sun allows Larvesta to recover some lost HP. 
Will-O-Wisp burns physical attackers without having to rely on Flame Body.
Sunny Day provides sun support for Grass-types with Chlorophyll. It also increases the amount of recovery from Morning Sun and boosts the power of Flare Blitz.
The combination of U-turn + Sunny Day provides great utility and allows Larvesta to safely bring in a Chlorophyll users.

Set Details
========
Maximum attack EVs are necessary to maintain as much offense as possible.
The leftover EVs are used to increase Larvesta's overall bulk.
76 HP EVs give Larvesta an odd HP stat, thus enabling it to switch into Stealth Rock twice.
With Flame Body Larvesta can punish Fighting-types, like Mienfoo, that often carry Knock Off as well as other users of Knock Off like Pawniard and Gligar.
Due to Larvesta's Fire typing, it can easily switch into Steel-types, like Pawniard and Bronzor, that are becoming popular.

Usage Tips
========
Larvesta fits perfectly on VoltTurn teams that lack a solid answer to Fighting-types.
Larvesta should always be paired with pokemon that can remove hazards for it.
Playing recklessly should be avoided if hazards are up.
Entry hazards should be removed as soon as possible, so Larvesta wouldn't have to lose 50% upon switching in.
Larvesta makes for a decent fodder due to its ability. Burning a foe when going down could be game changing.

Team Options
========
Rapid Spin users as well as Defog users, to remove entry hazards.
Staryu and Drilbur are both top notch spinners
The former covers Larvesta's Water weakness while the latter covers its Rock weakness.
Gligar can remove hazards with Defog, and Larvesta can cover its Ice weakness. Gligar learns U-turn and can form an annoying VoltTurn core with Larvesta.
Teammates that resist Flying and Water are appreciated.
Chinchou is an example, as it resist both. Chinchou and Larvesta can also form a VoltTurn core that can gain continuous momentum. Chinchou can also beat other Water-types with an Electric-type move. Chinchou can also take on Murkrow.
Helioptile, much like Chinchou, can form a VoltTurn core with Larvesta. It gets a special mention as it can absorb Water-type attacks aimed at Larvesta, with Dry Skin.
Grass-types, such as Foongus, can take care of annoying Water-types.
Sun support from Vulpix is appreciated as it boosts Larvesta's Flare Blitz.
Other teammates that can take advantage of the sun Larvesta provides are cool options. Chlorophyll sweepers like Oddish, Bulbasaur and Bellsprout can break through the opponent's walls. They can also threaten Water-types that bugs Larvesta.
Having teammates, like Ferroseed, that can lay down entry hazards are appreciated. Larvesta takes advantage of that as it forces a ton of switches. Ferroseed synergizes well with Larvesta as it can take Rock-type attacks aimed at Larvesta, while Larvesta takes on Fighting-types. 
Other partners that can take on Rock-types include Magnemite, Bronzor and Pawniard. 
Pawniard gets a special mention as it can form a cool offensive core. Larvesta also patches Pawniard's dreadful quadruple Fighting weakness.
Other Options
########
Wild Charge to hit Water- and Flying-types on the switch.
Choice Scarf
Toxic
Flame Charge
Zen Headbutt, but Flare Blitz hits Fighting types harder.
Bug Bite > U-turn, but Berries are rare
Calm Mind with Fire Blast, Bug Buzz and Psychic i guess

Checks & Counters
########
Stealth Rock
Flying-types like Murkrow and Gligar. Both must be wary of a Flame Body burn though. 
Water-types like Staryu and Chinchou can switch in and threaten with a Water STAB. The former does risk switching into a Wild Charge, however. Larvesta can escape both on the switch though, with U-turn.
Tirtouga can threat Larvesta with a Stone Edge or set up a Shell Smash, but risk being hit with a Will-O-Wisp or Wild Charge.
Other Fire-types, like Ponyta, resists Larvesta's STABs and can threaten Larvesta with a strong Flare Blitz.
Random Rock moves from pokemon like Mienfoo can KO Larvesta.
Lileep can OHKO Larvesta with Ancient Power, but does risk getting KOed by Flare Blitz + U-turn.
