<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Psychic is the most powerful of all special Psychic-type moves without drawbacks. Even though it has great distribution since it's a Technical Machine, it doesn't see a lot of uses in competitive play outside of STAB, because it has fairly poor coverage. However, it is commonly used as a STAB move for Pokemon such as Reuniclus and Alakazam, filling this role perfectly due to its great power and accuracy. Some battlers prefer to forgo Psychic in favor of Psyshock, since it hits most special walls harder, such as the omnipresent Blissey; however, Psychic is the more common sight in competitive battling because of its greater Base Power. It also pairs up nicely with Focus Blast, which hits Steel- and Dark-types for super effective damage.</p>
