Traps and damages the target for 4-5 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and traps the target for 4-5 turns, dealing 1/16 of the target's maximum HP at the end of each of those turns and preventing the target from switching. If the user is holding a Grip Claw, it traps the target for 5 turns all the time. If a trapped Pokemon uses Rapid Spin, it will be freed. If the user is holding a Binding Band, the damage dealt at the end of each turn increases to 1/8 of the target's maximum HP. The target can still switch out if it is holding Shed Shell or uses Baton Pass, U-turn, or Volt Switch. This effect is not stackable or reset by using this or another partial-trapping move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Fire Spin can be used to trap a Pokemon on the switch, allowing you to ensure that your counter comes in on that Pokemon, or allowing you to set up on a Pokemon that cannot touch you while it is trapped. However, as the incoming Pokemon will likely be a counter, Fire Spin will only obtain you a small amount of residual damage until you switch out.</p>
