Overview
########

- Roserade's 105 base special defense makes it pretty bulky.
- Access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes.
- Hits hard with 125 base special attack.
- Has reliable recovery in either Synthesis or Rest+Natural Cure.
- Sleep Powder+Spikes now possible.
- Natural Cure makes it a good status absorber.
- Strong Hidden Powers with Technician.
- 60/65 physical bulk makes it very frail.
- Weak to common types like Ice, Fire, and Flying.
- 90 base speed is lackluster.

Offensive Spikes
########
name: Offensive Spikes
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Sleep Powder
move 3: Leaf Storm
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
ability: Technician
item: Life Orb
evs: 4HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

- Leaf Storm hits a lot of non-resists hard and quick, Roserade isn't built to stay.
- Sleep Powder shuts down a pokemon and uses the free turn to set Spikes.
- Hidden Power Fire dents Steels trying to take Leaf Storm, further boosted by Technician. Without it, you lose OHKOs on bulky Mega Scizor, Skarmory, Mega Mawile, Lucario, Bisharp, Excadrill, Ferrothron, and Mega Pinsir with rocks, and a 2HKO on tank Aegislash.
- Hidden Power Fire also nails grasses trying to absorb Sleep Powder.
- Sludge Bomb gives you a powerful neutral move, landing 2HKOs on important and common switch-ins like Mega Venusaur, Kyurem-B, and Mandibuzz.

Set Details
========

- Max Speed and Special Attack to put slower things to sleep and set Spikes as quickly as possible, while also hitting any switch-ins hard.
- Life Orb gives you a lot more power, and Giga Drain can be used over Leaf Storm to recover the recoil as an alternative.
- Technician gives a great boost to Hidden Power, which is usually more valuable than Natural Cure

Usage Tips
========

- Set hazards on predicted switches, and keep Roserade around to attack instead of sacrificing it early on.
- Only switch him in on resisted special hits, it's rather frail otherwise.
- Use Leaf Storm to hit hard before dying, while using Hidden Power Fire to nail predicted switches attempting to take Leaf Storm.

Team Options
========

- Talonflame appreciates Spikes damage, and Roserade can handle Rotom-W in return.
- A Defiant user to abuse Defog can pairs well, like a Bisharp or Thundurus.
- Heatran lays Stealth Rock and deals with Talonflame and grasses, while Roserade sets spikes on bulky waters.
- Keldeo applies much more pressure on its checks with Spikes around.
- Rotom-W checks Talonflame and grabs momentum with Volt Switch.
- Skarmory can answer to many pokemon that can kill Roserade, like Mamoswine and Mega Pinsir. Just be sure not to Defog any hazards you've set up. 

Specially Defensive Spikes
########
name: Specially Defensive Spikes
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Sludge Bomb
move 4: Rest / Synthesis
ability: Natural Cure
item: Black Sludge
evs: 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

- Spikes offers residual damage for more defensive and balanced teams.
- Toxic Spikes can be used for poison support, but many OU pokemon aren't affected by or can absorb them.
- Giga Drain offers a reliable attacking move with recovery.
- Hidden Power Fire ensure Ferrothorn and Scizor cannot set up.
- Sludge Bomb's coverage is worse, but its stronger and more reliable.
- Rest can be used with Natural Cure to fully recover.
- Synthesis is an option if you don't want to switch out after healing.

Set Details
========

- EVs give Roserade the best overall bulk, letting it take on Rotom-W and Keldeo with ease.
- Black Sludge gives you passive recovery. Rest gives you a full restore but forces you to switch, while Synthesis offers reliable recovery but is hindered by weather.

Usage Tips
========

- Try to switch in on a special attack that you resist, especially water or electric moves like thunderbolt and scald.
- Lay down spikes on free turns, like switches.
- Lay Spikes on Pokemon that can't hurt you, like Rotom-W or Sylveon.
- Heal as necessary and switch out against pokemon that threaten you to stay alive as long as possible
- Attack when necessary to avoid getting killed or to stop opposing hazards.
- If you want something with better bulk, use Mega Venusaur, but Roserade lays down hazards and doesn't mind burns.

Team Options
========

- Heatran can come in on threats that Roserade doesn't like, such as Latias and Latios, and then phaze the switch-in to rack up residual damage with spikes.
- A bulky Rotom-W can take on many of the fire types switching into Roserade, especially talonflame, and burn physical threats.
- A Bisharp or Thundurus (with Defiant) works great to take advantage of Defog.

Other Options
########

- All-Out Attacker
- Aromatherapy
- Subseed
- Shadow Ball
- Double Powder (Sleep Powder + Stun Spore)
- Rain Dance/Sunny Day (+ Weather Ball)

Checks & Counters
########
- Strong Fire types, like Talonflame or Heatran, can easily defeat Roserade.
- Physical attackers will heavily damage Roserade, like Dragonite.
- Snorlax can take any hit, absorb sleep with RestTalk sets, and set up or just kill.
- Crobat can Taunt to prevent Spikes, remove hazards with Defog, and kill with Brave Bird.
- Dragons that resist grass (Lati@s, Goodra, Dragonite, Mega Charizard-X, Kyurem-B) generally do a good job against Roserade.
- Users of Assault Vest, like Conkeldurr and Goodra, generally do a good job of getting rid of it. AV Excadrill gets a special mention for being able to spin as well.
