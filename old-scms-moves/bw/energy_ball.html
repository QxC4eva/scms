<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Energy Ball is a reliable, albeit weak, specially based Grass-type attack. Most users of Energy Ball do not receive STAB on it and use the move for coverage options, for two reasons: firstly, there are many more powerful Grass-type moves, such as Leaf Storm and Seed Flare, which most Grass-types would rather use for STAB. Secondly, Energy Ball is a TM, so many Pokemon with access to this move may use it. While Grass-type moves have relatively poor coverage, they do hit bulky Water-types super effectively, so Fire-types, such as Ninetales and Chandelure, can frequently be seen running this move.</p>
