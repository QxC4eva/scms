[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder receives no recoil damage if it uses a recoil move. This does not apply to <a href="/bw/moves/struggle">Struggle</a>'s recoil damage, nor does it block the recoil from <a href="/bw/items/life_orb">Life Orb</a>, <a href="/bw/items/jaboca_berry">Jaboca</a> or <a href="/bw/items/rowap_berry">Rowap Berries</a>, or the recoil from missing <a href="/bw/moves/jump_kick">Jump Kick</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/hi_jump_kick">Hi Jump Kick</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rock Head is an underrated ability. The main user is generally seen as <a href="/bw/pokemon/aggron">Aggron</a> with its great Attack and monstrous 150 Base Power STAB <a href="/bw/moves/head_smash">Head Smash</a> being thrown about, although realistically in this metagame it won't have much hope of surviving long anyway. As long as the metagame is centered around sandstorm and rain, Rock Head users will not be seen often at all.</p>
