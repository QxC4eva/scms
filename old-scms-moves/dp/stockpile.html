[SHORT DESC]
Boosts the user's Def and SpD 1 stage. Sets the user up to use Spit Up and Swallow.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Boosts the user's Defense and Special Defense one stage, and sets the user up to use Spit Up and Swallow. Can be stacked to three uses. The defensive boosts are lost when the user uses Spit Up or Swallow. The Stockpile is lost when the user switches. If the user uses Baton Pass, the Stockpiles themselves are lost, but the boosts are passed. Spit Up and Swallow only remove the defensive boosts gained by Stockpile. If a Pokemon uses Cosmic Power five times, then Stockpiles three times, after using Spit Up or Swallow, the Pokemon will have +5 in both defenses.</p>
