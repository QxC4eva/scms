[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the power of all of the holder's damage-dealing Steel-type attacks by 20%. If Onix is traded while holding this item, it will evolve into Steelix. If Scyther is traded while holding this item, it will evolve into Scizor.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Metal Coat isn't bad, but it isn't that good either. While a 20% boost to Steel-type attacks is decent, it's not quite as excellent as the 30% boost to all attacks that you get from Life Orb. If you don't like Life Orb's recoil damage, or want to try to bluff a Choice item, then Expert Belt is typically a better overall choice for its added damage to all super effective attacks. Even if you are running a mono-attacking set with Steel coverage (not recommended), either Leftovers or Life Orb would probably be better for your purposes, depending on your build.</p>

<p>Metal Coat can, however, be a useful item for Scizor, in order to bluff a Choice Band set, or if you want a more powerful Swords Dance set without the recoil from Life Orb, as it boosts the power of Scizor's most feared attack, Bullet Punch.</p>
