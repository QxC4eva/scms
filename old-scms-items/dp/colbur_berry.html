<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Dark-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed during the damage calculation. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Dark-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The fact that most Psychic- and Ghost-types in the fourth generation have more effective items to hold severely limits the utility of the Colbur Berry. In fact, the only real use for this item is on Pokemon that lure in Dark-type attacks, and, having survived said attack, succeed in its primary role. Colbur Berry usually sees use on sweepers or suicide leads that have trouble bypassing Sucker Punch, Payback, or Pursuit. Azelf, a current practitioner of Colbur Berry, makes great use of this item when faced with common leads, especially Tyranitar and Payback Machamp. Use Colbur Berry only when certain circumstances call for it.</p>
