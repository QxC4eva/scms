<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Upon switching in, the wielder copies the opponent's ability. In doubles and triples battles, Trace randomly selects which opponent's ability to copy. Trace cannot copy <a href="/bw/abilities/flower_gift">Flower Gift</a>, <a href="/bw/abilities/forecast">Forecast</a>, <a href="/bw/abilities/illusion">Illusion</a>, <a href="/bw/abilities/imposter">Imposter</a>, <a href="/bw/abilities/multitype">Multitype</a>, Trace, and <a href="/bw/abilities/zen_mode">Zen Mode</a>. If the opponent has just been KOed, Trace will copy the ability of the next Pokemon revealed in the battle. Trace will immediately activate whenever the ability is acquired, such as through <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There is only one fully evolved user of Trace, and that's <a href="/bw/pokemon/gardevoir">Gardevoir</a>. However, <a href="/bw/pokemon/porygon2">Porygon2</a> is the best user of Trace by far, being able to check Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/chandelure">Chandelure</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/gyarados">Gyarados</a> with the combination of its bulk, <a href="/bw/items/eviolite">Eviolite</a>, and the copied <a href="/bw/abilities/flash_fire">Flash Fire</a> and <a href="/bw/abilities/intimidate">Intimidate</a> respectively. It can check many other Pokemon that have abilities that have pseudo-immunities such as <a href="/bw/abilities/water_absorb">Water Absorb</a>, making Porygon2 a decent choice for an OU team, so it does have at least some competitive use. Gardevoir can also be seen, but it is a lot rarer than Porygon2.</p>
