[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage, but can only be used while the user is sleeping. Has a 30% chance to flinch the target. Fails if the user is not asleep. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Although Snore is given out liberally, most Pokemon cannot make use of it due to its low Base Power, which makes it generally inferior to Sleep Talk (which has the chance to pick a much stronger or useful move). It does perhaps merit interest due to being at only 40 Base Power and thus being boosted by Technician; for example, Scizor or even Persian could perhaps utilize a bulky set with Rest, Technician-boosted Snore, and the handy 30% flinch chance. Of course, this is gimmicky at best.</p>

<h2>Related Moves</h2>
<p>Sleep Talk can only be used once the user is sleeping, but rather than having set damage and effects, it uses one of the Pokemon's other moves within its moveset.</p>
