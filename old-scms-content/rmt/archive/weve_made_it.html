<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hey fellas, how ya doin'. Furai here, this time with an LC RMT.<br/ >
I have beem experimenting almost every tier in the BW metagame besides UU and RU (well, and NU) for a while and LC was the latest one I got into. I was awfully bad. Really, I completely hated the tier, because I did not get it. When I decided I wanted to go back into LC, I signed up for LC101 as a tutee. Chieliee was assigned as my tutor.</p>

<p>For our first lessons, I completely sucked. Really. I dropped below 950s if I recall correctly. I took a team that was in my team folder for a long while, and started revamping it with the help of Chieliee. After about a month, experimenting each version of the team and looking for weaknesses, <strong>We've Made It</strong> was created.</p>

<p>I really like Offense, while still being able to remain balanced, so this team perfectly suits me and my playstyle. Someone told me here that "teams are not worth if you are not in perfect sync with them". I aimed for that goal and fortunately I achieved it.</p>

<p>During my climb to the top I have beaten many known people like elevator_music (<3), Ray Jay D), D4RR3N (Sup Bitch?) and Drifloon (.sECRET, who had the ladder peaked for a long while).</p>

<p>Before I end the introduction, I'm more than glad to say that <strong><u>I dedicate this team to Chieliee.</u></strong> Without him I wouldn't be here or at that spot.<br/ >
You deserve it man!</p>

<p>So yeah, to the team, shall we?</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/649.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Mienfoo</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br/ >
Ability: Regenerator<br/ >
EVs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe<br/ >
Jolly Nature<br/ >
- Drain Punch<br/ >
- Hi Jump Kick<br/ >
- Stone Edge<br/ >
- U-turn</p>

<p>The big boss. Definetly my most favorite Pokemon in this metagame. It's just too good. Mienfoo is my main sweeper and my guard from Scraggy. The thing is, that I must not let Scraggy get to +2, and that is not a hard task with Larvesta and Croagunk in the team. Mienfoo also synergizes very well with the team, and gives lots of support like scouting with <strong>U-turn</strong> which is just plain awesome with that amazing ability called Regenerator and with Larvesta. This thing also hits like a truck, <strong>Hi Jump Kick</strong> from Mienfoo is probably the strongest attack in the metagame. <strong>Drain Punch</strong> is there for backup, in case I don't want to risk a miss like against a ~60% Scraggy or when I'm in low health. <strong>Stone</strong> Edge is there for coverage, and it's pretty awesome against Gastly, Larvesta and Flying- switch ins, dealing 75% minimum to the first one mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Bronzor</strong> @ Eviolite<br/ >
Ability: Levitate<br/ >
EVs: 220 HP / 152 Def / 8 SpA / 72 SpD / 16 Spe<br/ >
Sassy Nature<br/ >
- Psychic<br/ >
- Hidden Power Fighting<br/ >
- Toxic<br/ >
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Probably the glue of the team. This little fella right here is my guard against Drilbur and Brave Birds, shame it doesn't get a reliable recovery. But that doesn't mean he's not good, and you all probably know it. Bronzor is most likely one of the best Supporters out there, and for a good reason. <strong>Stealth Rock</strong> is the most basic Entry Hazard and a must for every team. It allows me to get a few important OHKOs and 2HKOs, like against Scraggy which Hi Jump Kick does 95% minimum - and I am not willing to take the risk. <strong>Psychic</strong> is a good STAB move, taking care of Croagunks and other Fighting- types, so he won't become a set-up bait for them. Because of iss's strategy of Air Balloon + Magnet Rise Magnemite with Drilbur, I am using <strong>Hidden Power [Fighting]</strong> over Earthquake, so I could have a chance against that strategy. Eartquake was truly only for Magnemite and Chinchou, who are dealt by the rest of the team. I am now using <strong>Toxic</strong> over Hidden Power [Ice] because Psychic does just about the same damage, like ~5% less. Toxic however, allows me to put many Pokemon under pressure like Chinchou, Mienfoo or Drifloon, meaning they would have to pick their move wisely and their lifespan on the field would be shorter.</p>

<p><strong>Croagunk</strong> @ Eviolite<br/ >
Ability: Dry Skin<br/ >
EVs: 52 HP / 188 Atk / 116 Def / 116 SpD / 36 Spe<br/ >
Adamant Nature<br/ >
- Fake Out<br/ >
- Sucker Punch<br/ >
- Drain Punch<br/ >
- Taunt</p>

<p>Croagunk is a key Pokemon in my team as well. From the beginning I have used the Bulky Attacker because I knew that Croagunk needs to stay on the field as much as possible, because it tanks many hard attacks like Hi Jump Kick. Croagunk also removes Toxic Spikes immediately due to his typing, which are a pain. <Strong>Fake Out and Sucker Punch</strong> are my only Priority moves, and on Croagunk they are a very solid choice. With these moves I'm able to check Clamperl, Drilbur, Drifloon and Gastly, unless they use non-attacking moves which in that case will be a mindgame. <strong>Drain Punch</strong> is such a cool move. Croagunk has no reliable recovery and Drain Punch combines both STAB and recovery into one attack which is great. With Toxic on Bronzor, I don't really need Toxic on Croagunk too. So I picked <strong>Taunt</strong>, so SubHypnosis will not have a fun time switching into me. With that I could also smack it with Sucker Punch because it must use an attacking move (or switch), and prevent from stuff like Lileep setting up on me.</p>

<p><strong>Chinchou</strong> @ Eviolite<br/ >
Ability: Volt Absorb<br/ >
EVs: 52 Def / 232 SpA / 220 Spe<br/ >
Modest Nature<br/ >
- Volt Switch<br/ >
- Hydro Pump<br/ >
- Heal Bell<br/ >
- Hidden Power Grass</p>

<p>(+).(+) tzz tzz. iss's favorite Pokemon, and probably for a good reason. Chinchou is the third force in the combo of Mienfoo-Larvesta-Chinchou, added after both Mienfoo and Larvesta, being able to spam STAB <strong>Volt Switch</strong> and cure status with <strong>Heal Bell</strong>. Chinchou functions as a counter to most Water- types, Bulky and Offensive together, in the metagame, especially Staryu which can spin off my Stealth Rock and opposing Chinchou who annoys me with Volt Switch. <strong>Hydro Pump</strong> is a good STAB move, landing a few marks on my opponent with its big base power. <strong>Hidden Power [Grass]</strong> is there so I will have something to hit opposing Chinchou with, Hydro Pump barely tickles it.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/666.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Larvesta</strong> @ Eviolite<br/ >
Ability: Flame Body<br/ >
EVs: 76 HP / 156 Atk / 76 Def / 76 SpD / 124 Spe<br/ >
Adamant Nature<br/ >
- Morning Sun<br/ >
- Will-O-Wisp<br/ >
- U-turn<br/ >
- Flare Blitz</p>

<p>The rising star of the metagame. Larvesta is so cute and very important for the team. It allows me to beat U-Turn chains by Flame Body haxxing the opponent. This ability comes in handy against Fighting- types the most, except for Timburr who will just enjoy the burn. I tweaked prem's EVs a bit so I could speedtie with Exeggcute and by that I will leave a lot of pressure on it. <strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong> is good for the cases where Flame Body doesn't burn my opponent and for trolling those Sucker Punch users (e.g. Stunky HAHAHAHAA). <strong>Morning Sun</strong> is amazing on Larvesta so it could expand its lifespan on the field. <strong>Flare Blitz</strong> hits so hard already, combine that with STAB and that it's not even funny anymore. <strong>U-turn</strong> is another STAB move, which suits the team very well, scouting along with Chinchou and Mienfoo.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/120.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Staryu</strong> @ Eviolite<br/ >
Ability: Natural Cure<br/ >
EVs: 116 HP / 116 SpA / 236 Spe<br/ >
Timid Nature<br/ >
- Hydro Pump<br/ >
- Thunderbolt<br/ >
- Rapid Spin<br/ >
- Recover</p>

<p>Because every Larvesta needs <strong>Rapid Spin</strong> support, and Staryu is clearly the best spinner in the game. Staryu as well maintains the Offensive power of Clamperl, while still being Bulkier and faster. <strong>Recover</strong> is all about increasing the time Staryu would spend battling. <strong>Hydro Pump</strong> hits pretty hard, being able to hit hard stuff like Gastly (which is OHKOd) and Mienfoo. <strong>Thunderbolt</strong> has very good coverage with Hydro Pump and can dent Water- and Flying- Pokemon with an ease. Staryu is pretty much self-explanatory, everyone knows it because it's really awesome.</p>
