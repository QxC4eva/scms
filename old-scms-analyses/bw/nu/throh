[Overview]

<p>As the bulkiest Fighting-type in the game (sans Fist Plate Arceus), Throh is an integral defensive threat in the NU metagame. He's no slouch offensively, either. Base 100 Attack is quite solid, and he has both Bulk Up and Guts to boost it further. Circle Throw is a great phazing attack, and Throh is the bulkiest user of the move; he also gets STAB on it, to boot. His poor Speed stat is a drawback, but he thankfully has high enough defenses that he can survive most assaults before hitting back. Unfortunately, with Rest as his only recovery move, he is prone to being worn down fairly quickly.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bulk Up allows Throh to boost both his Attack and Defense, transforming him into both an offensive and defensive threat. Circle Throw is a good STAB attack that also phazes out the opponent, preventing them from setting up alongside him. As Ghost-types are immune to Circle Throw, Payback is a great option for taking them on; due to Throh's low Speed, Payback will usually get the power boost, as well. Rest is his only recovery move, and it is necessary to keep him around after setting up. A Chesto Berry is Throh's item of choice, as it will wake him up instantly after he uses Rest to heal up.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Careful nature and the given EVs maximize Throh's special bulk, with the remaining 4 boosting his physical bulk. Leftovers is an option over Chesto Berry to give him consistent healing, but it will leave him as a sitting duck after using Rest. Therefore, Substitute becomes a good option over Rest when using Leftovers, as it keeps him safe from status and weak attacks, while the recovery from Leftovers allows him to set up more Substitutes. Stone Edge can be used over Payback for better overall coverage, but it doesn't hit his Ghost- and Psychic-type counters as hard. Taunt is also an option for Throh, as it prevents the opponent from setting up a Substitute that would block Circle Throw's phazing, but his low Speed makes it less reliable.</p>

<p>As this set aims to constantly phaze the opponent, the extra damage from entry hazards is highly recommended. Cacturne can help break through Ghost- and Psychic-types and set up Spikes for your team. Garbodor is the most reliable user of Toxic Spikes, and it can set up Spikes as well. Clerics also make great allies, as they can wake up Throh after he uses Rest; Lickilicky and Audino are both great choices for this, and they can use Wish to keep him healthy as well. Skuntank is one of the best choices for removing Ghost-types that are immune to Circle Throw, as he can use Pursuit or Sucker Punch to easily destroy them.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Due to Throh's low Speed, good bulk, and solid Attack stat, he makes a great abuser of Trick Room; Toxic Orb is his preferred item for such a set, as it boosts his Attack stat thanks to Guts. A RestTalk set with Rest / Sleep Talk / Circle Throw / Bulk Up sounds promising, but RestTalk isn't a very reliable strategy. Taunt is an unexpected move for him to run, and can prevent slower opponents from setting up against him. Toxic allows him to wear down opposing walls, though he has trouble fitting it onto his main set. Though Throh is certainly bulky enough to set up Rain Dance or Sunny Day for your team, he gains no direct benefit from either of these weathers. Storm Throw is good attack that always scores a critical hit, allowing Throh to smash through Bulk Up and Stockpile users, but the phazing from Circle Throw can do the same and has more utility in general. Superpower is his strongest STAB attack, but it is only useful on a Trick Room sweeper set. Brick Break is an option for breaking through your opponent's screens, should they be problematic for your team.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Powerful, faster Flying-types, such as Swellow and Braviary, can cause massive damage with their STAB Brave Bird, even after a Bulk Up or two. Similarly, faster and powerful Psychic-types, such as Gardevoir, are also problematic for Throh. Musharna resists Throh's STAB and is slower than him, meaning Payback will not get a power boost; it also outspeeds Throh under Trick Room. Ghost-types in general can wall Throh's STAB; Haunter in particular can use Substitute and Disable to survive a Payback and prevent Throh from using it again, completely walling him.</p>
