<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage, and the user receives recoil damage equal to 1/3 of the damage dealt, rounded half up, but not less than 1 HP.</p> 

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Double-Edge is one of the most powerful Normal-type moves; it has a great distribution, being a Tutor Move in Generation III and a common breeding move for several other, newer Pokemon. However, thanks to the mechanics (and the clearly offensive nature of the move) only few Pokemon can use it to the fullest extent. Staraptor is probably the best of these, thanks to its STAB on Normal-type moves, excellent Attack and Speed stats, just the right coverage moves, and its Reckless ability, which boosts the power of Double-Edge by 20%. It also has Roost to offset the not inconsiderable recoil damage.</p>

<p>Rock Head and Magic Guard users also can make good use of this move; Clefable is perhaps the most notable thanks to its Normal-type STAB, but unfortunately no Rock Head Pokemon gets STAB on Double-Edge. As far as Rock Head Pokemon are concerned, Marowak deserves a mention thanks to its exclusive Thick Club item, which boosts its attacks to colossal levels while letting him switch moves. Double-Edge serves the purpose of hitting Pokemon immune to Ground-type moves, since the Rock-type moves available for him have poor accuracy, which can be troublesome. Another notable user is Aerodactyl, who lacks power on all its other coverage moves.<p>
