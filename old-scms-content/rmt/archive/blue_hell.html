<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The team is based on using SubProtect Wallrein and SubProtect Glaceon with Toxic Support to wear down the opponent, before going for a lategame duosion sweep. Rotom-F and Cryogonal provide utility to the team, with Rotom-F providing momentum and revenge killing capabilities, and Cryogonal spinning away the Rocks which plague 5/6 of my team. Duosion is the star of the team, CM Duosion is the boss with hail damage+ toxic support.This team did not have any hazards , as i personally don't like the hazard users that were available in NU, Scolipede, Roselia and Smeargle were good but more suit different teams, such as more offensive or non-weather teams. Besides if i use hazards support I would also use one spin blocker(probably Misdreavus eviolite), despite the lacking of good spinners in NU.

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Snover</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Snow Warning<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Leech Seed<br />
- Protect<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Blizzard</p>

<p>Despite being the weakest member of my team, Snover is the only thing that makes this team work, as I need Hail. I chose to use a physically defensive variant as I had noticed that much of NU was based on strong physical attackers, and he has not let me down. Toxic+Leech Seed+Protect is always annoying and provides his best way to deal damage, and protect also helps to scout. Blizzard is only really to prevent him being taunt bait, and is actually surprisingly strong, 2hkoing 0/0 Scolipede who fails to 1hko with Mega-Horn. He is almost always my lead, and most people seem to overestimate his importance to me, meaning they will often overpredict.</p>

<p><strong>Cryogonal</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>This is my spinner, it is required given that I have 5 Ice types. It flat out walls most special attackers, I don't bother with defense EVs as he still dies to most neutral STAB attacks  In additin, the special defense evs allow him to take other things much better(for example magneton). Toxic is helps to spread more residual damage, and he doesnt reslly have much better options.Recover keeps him healthy and lets him stall out some pokemon, and Blizzard again prevents him from being taunt bait, as well as being fairly strong.</p>

<p><strong>Glaceon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Ice Body<br />
EVs: 80 HP / 12 Def / 252 SpA / 164 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Hidden Power Ground<br />
- Protect<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Blizzard</p>

<p>This pokemon right here is one of the most important members of my team, along with duosion and wallrein is a member of the most important for the team. He especially likes pokemon with Life Orb, as they just die so fast. He enjoys the Toxic's spread around by my other mons, and so I find clerics such as Flareon and Lickilciky very annoying, as it takes much longer for him to get his job done. The moveset is pretty simple, Sub-Protect allows hom to stall out opposing mons, Blizzard provides a strong reliable STAB, while HP ground hits Magneton and Klinklang hard, stopping the, from setting up on me.</p>

<p><strong>Walrein</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Ice Body<br />
EVs: 232 HP / 252 Def / 24 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Protect<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Surf</p>

<p>the WALLrein, has claimed many a victim, with his excellent bulk and annoying combination of Substituite and Protect. Surf gives me different coverage, allowing me to hit Magmortar hard who is a big danger to this team, while Toxic provides support as well as quickenign the opponent's death. Not much to explain, Stallrein is great and so annoying.</p>

<p><strong>Duosion</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Magic Guard<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Psyshock<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>Once all my other pokes have done their job, Duosion comes out to play. With opponents weakened from my stalling, they have nothing to stop my little jelly bear rampage through the remains of their team. The EVs let him set up more Calm Minds on physical pokemon, and the rest is standard, psyshock letting me win CM wars (although they are very rare) and hp fighting gives me great coverage, only missing out on psychihc types like slowking, who can't do jack back. Duosion also serves as my glue, protecting me from threats to my team like Sawk.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-F</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Volt Switch<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Trick</p>

<p>This thing lets me revenge kill nearly everything, with his trolly base speed letting him just about outspeed scarf Sawk ans Pinsir and +2 Gorebyss. Blizzard and thunderbolt provide his fantastic dual-STAB, and volt switch allows me to keep momentum, with Trick screwing up Walls coming in to tango with him, destroying pokemon such as Flareon, Lickilicky or Miltank. He is fantastic, and I am sad that he is now outclased by Rotom-s u less you want to gamble with 70% accuracy.</p>
