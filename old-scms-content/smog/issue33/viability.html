<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
There are several instances in competitive Pok&eacute;mon in which one member of an evolutionary family struggles to stand out while another member of that same family is a top-tier threat. Some Pok&eacute;mon, such as Ferrothorn and Conkeldurr, have all members of their evolutionary line worth using in competitive battling. However, there are others who are good in their own rights, but have less fortunate family members when it comes to the battlefield. This article will cover a few examples of how viability doesn't always run in the family. First-stage evolutions play in the Little Cup tier, which is where their viability will be analyzed. Alternatively, fully evolved Pok&eacute;mon will be evaluated on their performance in the most played tier: Overused.</p>

<div id="interview">

<div class="interview-speaker mattl"><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_mattl.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Lanturn</strong></p>

<p>Lanturn is a unique Pok&eacute;mon that has some interesting capabilities but a couple of important shortcomings. In lower tiers, it's a good user of Heal Bell with fairly good bulk due to its high HP stat. Water / Electric is a good typing that is made even better by Lanturn's fantastic Volt Absorb ability. Access to Scald, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Volt Switch gives Lanturn a nice array of coverage and utility attacking moves. Despite these qualities making it a solid choice in lower tiers, it's a bit underwhelming in OU. It lacks any form of reliable recovery, which is something that prevents Lanturn from being on the same level as all of OU's clerics. For example, Chansey is far bulkier than Lanturn and has not only Soft-Boiled to reliably recovery itself but also Wish to heal any Pok&eacute;mon on its team. Although Lanturn can be used as a special tank, base 76 Special Attack just doesn't really do the job in OU, despite Lanturn's typing and coverage. Overall, Lanturn could be summed up as follows: It's a decently bulky Water / Electric type whose ability gives it an immunity to a type that it normally would not resist. It can be used as a bulky Volt Switch-using pivot that attacks specially. It is capable of inflicting confusion, burn, paralysis, and Toxic poison upon the opponent.</p>

<p>These are good attributes, but unfortunately for Lanturn, one of OU's top Pok&eacute;mon also has all of these qualities. Lanturn can shine in RU, far from Rotom-W's reach, but it's not a Pok&eacute;mon you can really slap onto any OU team.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_briyella.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Chinchou</strong></p>

<p>While Lanturn faces stiff competition in the shadow of Rotom-W and struggles to find a spot on a team, its pre-evolution, Chinchou, doesn't suffer from such problems in the Little Cup tier. Chinchou is often the glue that holds balanced Little Cup teams together, and has been for Generations. It has a handy combination of traits that no other Pok&eacute;mon in the tier can lay claim to, and can run a multitude of viable sets, making it not only tricky to deal with, but also unpredictable, and so oftentimes the only surefire way to safely prepare for it is to first find out what set it's running. The first thing that should stand out for Chinchou is its unique dual typing combined with Volt Absorb, which provides it an immunity to Electric as well as healing if struck by an Electric-type attack; this can be used to keep Thunder Wave from crippling its teammates and thus lets it switch in on the likes of Slowpoke relatively easily.</p>

<p>Apart from switching in on Thunder Wave, another thing it has to mess with the prominent Little Cup threat that is Murkrow is a welcome resistance to Flying in addition to an offensive advantage. Viable LC Pok&eacute;mon that resist Flying without being weak to Fighting are pretty uncommon and so this is a pretty notable advantage. Another thing Chinchou has over everything else in the tier is that it is the only Volt Switch-using pivot and Electric-type Thunder Wave user with a STAB type that threatens the Ground-types that block these moves, making Pok&eacute;mon like Gligar think twice before attempting to make that play to gain momentum. Chinchou is able to make effective use of Eviolite (with Wish support from a teammate), Berry Juice, and Choice Scarf to be able to fit many different kinds of teams and playstyles, and is also one of the more bulky Pok&eacute;mon in the tier that can use both Heal Bell and RestTalk to good effect. All in all, Chinchou is a very good Pok&eacute;mon in Little Cup that serves very important purposes and is irreplaceable. There are some things that Helioptile can do similarly, but it doesn't even come close to the effectiveness that Chinchou displays in battle both by itself and as a pivot/supporter for its team.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker mattl"><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_mattl.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Aromatisse</strong></p>

<p>You might have heard people say this, but it's true; Aromatisse is basically the similar but inferior Doubles-oriented version of Clefable. They have the same typing and almost identical base stats except for the fact that Aromatisse is much slower. Aromatisse does have one important advantage that Clefable doesn't: an immunity to Taunt, Encore, and other such moves due to Aroma Veil. Immunity to the former is especially crucial for a cleric with so many support capabilities. Speaking of which, Aromatisse can use Reflect, Light Screen, Wish, Aromatherapy, and Trick Room, which is a respectable list of support moves. Its pure Fairy typing and good bulk aid it defensively, while its usable base 99 Special Attack, access to Calm Mind, and decent special coverage allow it to perform somewhat of an offensive role as well. Along the offensive route, you could use Trick Room to turn Aromatisse's horrendous Speed into an advantage, but its unboosted offenses aren't anything to write home about.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you shouldn't use these sets in the OU environment, because even though Aromatisse has these nice qualities, Clefable does nearly everything it does, but better. Clefable has Magic Guard and Unaware, both of which are phenomenal abilities that Aromatisse wishes it had. Aromatisse's horrific Speed doesn't do it any favors either, making it helpless against many Steel-type Pok&eacute;mon, and some sweepers find it to be easy setup fodder. Besides Clefable, it also has competition from Sylveon and Florges, both of which are also pure Fairy-type clerics that have great special bulk. Aromatisse works well in Doubles or as a handy cleric in lower tiers, but it can't measure up enough to see any usage in OU.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_briyella.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Spritzee</strong></p>

<p>Contrary to Aromatisse's performance in OU, Aromatisse's previous form turns out to be the absolute best at what it does in LC. Spritzee was initially cast aside as unusable at the beginning of XY Little Cup due to the immense popularity of Swirlix, but a closer look at its capabilities resulted in a place for it in the spotlight that Swirlix couldn't touch. Enter Little Cup's alpha Fairy-type bulky support Pok&eacute;mon, one that can function well for itself as well as assist teammates in ways that other LC Pok&eacute;mon can only dream of. Spritzee's resistances to common attacking types such as Dark, Fighting, and Bug allow it ample opportunities to pass huge Wishes to its teammates, heal the entire team of status afflictions with Aromatherapy, or fire off a decently powerful STAB attack in Moonblast to destroy any opposing Dark- or Fighting-type enemies that are foolish enough to stay in against it. Spritzee's typing and support capabilities allow it to work well with Steel-types to form a resilient resistance core, in which Spritzee sponges the Fighting-type attacks aimed at its Steel-type partner, and it easily takes the super effective Poison- and Steel-type attacks directed at Spritzee.</p>

<p>Lastly, after opposing Poison- and Steel-types have been removed, Spritzee can serve as a late-game sweeper of sorts with Calm Mind, allowing it to rip through the opposition with Moonblast, healing itself with Wish when necessary, and not caring too much about being hit with paralysis, as it's slower than most things anyway. Lickitung is able to function similarly as a staller and a Wish supporter, but its lack of resistances and weakness to Fighting-types in a metagame full of them makes Spritzee the superior Pok&eacute;mon in most cases. There is absolutely nothing in Little Cup that can do what Spritzee does, and unsuspecting opponents would find themselves in deep trouble for underestimating it.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker mattl"><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_mattl.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Carracosta</strong></p>

<p>It's understandable to think that Carracosta could do well on paper and then be surprised to see that it was down in NU in Generation V. It has three great abilities, solid physical bulk, a STAB priority move in Aqua Jet to somewhat compensate for its poor Speed, passable offenses, and access to the coveted Shell Smash. Despite being able to double its Speed, Carracosta's base 32 Speed is still way too slow. After a Shell Smash, Adamant Carracosta is outsped by positive-natured base 105 Pok&eacute;mon, including Keldeo and Latios, both of which take little damage from an Aqua Jet and can OHKO Carracosta. Jolly Carracosta still fails to outspeed Starmie and other faster Pok&eacute;mon. This is its main drawback compared to a similar Pok&eacute;mon like Omastar; Carracosta needs more than just a Shell Smash to outspeed any common Choice Scarf users and some of the faster unboosted Pok&eacute;mon. Carracosta can use Swift Swim in conjunction with Shell Smash, but even in the rain, the same problems arise when Carracosta needs to attack before it can safely use Shell Smash.</p>

<p>Carracosta isn't just a Shell Smash sweeper, though. With Solid Rock and respectable bulk, it can function as a tank that can also set up Stealth Rock. It's underwhelming in the OU environment, however; Carracosta's base 108 Attack is good, but definitely not great, and its Water / Rock typing gives it a few important and common weaknesses. Don't let these flaws prevent you from using it, however. Carracosta faces a lot of competition from several other Shell Smash users and offensive Water-types in OU, but it was a very good Pok&eacute;mon in Generation V NU and likely will continue to be a top threat in Generation VI NU. It's not a bad Pok&eacute;mon in general, but there are some Pok&eacute;mon that do the same thing but better.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_briyella.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Tirtouga</strong></p>

<p>However, Carracosta's underling is quite a different story in the Little Cup arena. Tirtouga was a true menace to face in Little Cup last generation, and in XY Little Cup, it is not too different. In fact, the return of the previously banned Berry Juice item in LC has given Tirtouga a new edge as a setup sweeper, and so it must be dealt with by more specific means than it was before. Its combination of Sturdy and Shell Smash has always been formidable, but the addition of Berry Juice to its arsenal makes it considerably more threatening, as Sturdy guarantees that it will survive any attack on the turn it sets up with Shell Smash, and then Berry Juice brings it back to full health, restoring Sturdy and ensuring that it survives another attack, regardless of type advantage or how strong it is. With Sturdy and Berry Juice together, it will always require no less than three hits to take Tirtouga down, outside of some exceptions, and this is not easy to pull off after it has its Speed and Attack boosted to +2 by Shell Smash. The easiest way to get around Tirtouga's Sturdy + Berry Juice shenanigans is to hit it with Knock Off, which will break Sturdy and prevent Berry Juice from ever activating. Other ways to get around this strategy include using Trick/Switcheroo (to remove its Berry Juice and potentially pass it a crippling item), status like burn or paralysis, keeping Stealth Rock down to break Sturdy, and Bullet Seed, which hits Tirtouga for 4x super effective damage and also overrides Sturdy. Trying to overwhelm this set with brute force is usually a severely uphill battle and almost always results in a loss.</p>

<p>While arguably an inferior set in a mostly offensively inclined metagame, Tirtouga can also run a support set that utilizes Stealth Rock, Scald, and Knock Off, with the ability Solid Rock, allowing it to take super effective hits with relative comfort, especially physical ones. Of all the Shell Smash users in XY Little Cup, Tirtouga is unquestionably the most feared one in the vast majority of cases, and it is definitely deserving of the high usage it sees due to its ability to withstand constant battering from opponents as well as its overwhelming power that allows it to sweep through teams.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_briyella.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Larvitar</strong></p>

<p>Larvitar is an interesting Pok&eacute;mon in Little Cup. It's the only Rock / Ground type in the tier with access to Dragon Dance, and also the only one to have Guts as an ability. It gets STAB on both Earthquake and Stone Edge, a very potent attacking combination, while also having access to useful coverage options such as Crunch and Superpower. With these traits, respectable stats, and a few notable resistances (including a commendable one to Flying), it would appear that Larvitar has the potential to be a very overwhelming force if it manages to get a turn to set up with Dragon Dance, especially if it opts to run Guts and has Toxic Orb as its held item. While this is fundamentally true, there are a huge number of disadvantages that come with this. First of all, Larvitar's 4x weakness to Water is a huge thorn in its side, but not only that, it also has painful weaknesses to Ice, Fighting, Ground, and Steel, as well as a 4x weakness to Grass. Additionally, even if Larvitar does successfully set up, it is weak to several priority moves that are extremely common in Little Cup, including Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, Bullet Punch, Ice Shard, and Vacuum Wave, and these can be used against it to quickly bring it down despite its superior Speed and power. It can be used on a team well as long as important priority users are eliminated before it attempts to set up and sweep, but this is often a lot easier said than done, and it's usually not worth the work when there are other Dragon Dance sweepers like Scraggy and Tyrunt that require much less support.</p>

<p>It's tragic that Larvitar has all the tools necessary to be a fearsome setup sweeper in Little Cup, but is let down immensely by the defensive drawbacks of its typing, and so it is generally not recommended for use. What Larvitar lacks in viability is hugely retributed to it once it develops into its final form, however.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker mattl"><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_mattl.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Tyranitar</strong></p>

<p>Tyranitar has been a very influential OU Pok&eacute;mon for a long time with a long list of positive attributes. It's one of the few Pok&eacute;mon that can automatically summon weather, but unlike several of its weather-inducing counterparts, Tyranitar is a fantastic Pok&eacute;mon regardless of its ability to do so (see Ninetales). As a pseudo-legendary Pok&eacute;mon, it has a very high 600 BST and a great stat distribution for a tank. Tyranitar's offensive movepool is among the best in the entire game and can be put to good use with its usable base 95 Special Attack and its fantastic base 134 Attack. Tyranitar has incredible 100 / 110 / 100 bulk, especially when you consider how high its offensive stats are. It's one of the best Assault Vest users in the game due to its bulk, power, movepool, and the fact that that Tyranitar almost always has a 1.5x Special Defense boost due to sandstorm. Tyranitar is a great choice for a Pok&eacute;mon that sets up Stealth Rock for your team, and with its huge Attack stat and Dark typing, it's also just about the best Pursuit user in OU. It can run solid Choice Band and Choice Scarf sets that either help it deal out massive damage or Pursuit trap foes more effectively. If all of that wasn't enough, it was also one of the lucky Pok&eacute;mon to get a Mega Evolution, and a good one at that. Its Mega forme got extremely beneficial base stat boosts, allowing Mega Tyranitar to be a very threatening Dragon Dance user. With ridiculous 100 HP / 150 Def / 120 SpD bulk (remember that it still gets 1.5x Special Defense from sandstorm), it's usually capable of setting up a Dragon Dance safely and can then proceed to plow though opposing Pok&eacute;mon with its base 164 Attack.</p>

Tyranitar is an amazing Pok&eacute;mon, but it's definitely not perfect. Tyranitar has seven weaknesses, including a 4x weakness to Fighting, so even though Tyranitar is bulky, most Pok&eacute;mon have a super effective attack against it. Its low base 61 Speed means that even with a Choice Scarf, it's outsped by max Speed base 117 Pok&eacute;mon and higher, and without a Choice Scarf, it's outsped by almost every other offensive Pok&eacute;mon. Although its Mega forme got a Speed boost, it still only has base 71 Speed, which is far from impressive. Despite these flaws, Tyranitar has a ton of fantastic qualities which definitely propel it to the top of OU.</div>

<div class="interview-speaker briyella"><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_briyella.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Azurill</strong></p>

<p>Azurill is one of the few Little Cup Pok&eacute;mon to be retyped to include a Fairy typing, making it Normal / Fairy this Generation and giving it a welcome neutrality to Fighting but also added weaknesses to Poison and Steel. It gets one of the best abilities in the game in Huge Power, the same awesome trait that makes its Normal-type friend Bunnelby a monster. Despite these seemingly awesome advantages, there are a ton of downsides Azurill has that hold it back from seeing any meaningful use in Little Cup. First of all, despite its new retyping to Normal / Fairy, it gained no STAB Fairy-type attacks with which to take advantage of. Azurill's offensive stats are so incredibly poor that its Huge Power ability isn't even enough to salvage its potential in the physical offense department. Its lack of Water typing that its evolutions have prevents its Water-type attacks from dealing significant enough damage to matter, and its Speed is also appallingly low, causing it to be outsped by even decisively slow enemies such as Timburr. It has access to the buffed Knock Off and the rare Soak, but these options are not enough to justify using Azurill when there are far better users of both moves in the tier.</p>

<p>In the end, Azurill is exceedingly cute and unique in a few ways, but it is by no means a viable choice to fit onto a Little Cup team, and it is not recommended for competitive use at all. Though there is a vast array of drawbacks Azurill is cursed with, all of its problems are replaced with welcome advantages the instant it becomes Azumarill.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker mattl"><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_mattl.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Azumarill</strong></p>

<p>Azumarill is indeed a powerful Pok&eacute;mon even though it doesn't look like one. When you see a pitiful base 50 Attack, "wallbreaker" isn't exactly the first thing to pop into your head. That quickly changes when you see that Azumarill was given one of the best abilities in the game, doubling its Attack and allowing it to reach a stat of 436, just two points shy of offensive behemoths such as Zekrom and Rayquaza. Azumarill's Water / Fairy typing is very good both offensively and defensively, which combined with enormous power and solid bulk, make Azumarill one of the more threatening Pok&eacute;mon in the tier. Azumarill's poor Speed is an issue at times, but it was granted a STAB priority move in Aqua Jet. Choice Band Azumarill hits stupidly hard, especially because Azumarill is Adamant-natured most of the time, and is a great set to use in order to severely weaken opposing walls. It's also a good revenge killer due to Aqua Jet's power. Azumarill can also be a deadly sweeper; now that Belly Drum and Aqua Jet are legal on the same set, Azumarill can use its bulk, priority, and power to tear through teams whose Water-resistant Pok&eacute;mon and physical walls have been slightly weakened. Barring Focus Sash users, the only OU-legal Pok&eacute;mon that can even survive a hit from Azumarill after a Belly Drum are Mega Venusaur and Shedinja. Overall, Azumarill has a lot going for it: insane power, great typing, good STAB attacks, a priority STAB move, Superpower for good coverage, and respectable bulk.</p>

<p>Of course Azumarill isn't without flaws; it's slow and hard-countered by Mega Venusaur, OU's best defensive Mega Pok&eacute;mon, but Azumarill is still definitely a force to be reckoned with. Azumarill is one of OU's best physical attackers and it's not recommended to build a team that has no answers to it.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker briyella "><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_briyella.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Gible</strong></p>

<p>Gible is unique as the only Dragon-type in Little Cup to also have Ground typing, making it able to block the inevitable Thunder Wave and Volt Switch moves that are somewhat commonly used throughout the tier. However, apart from that, getting STAB on Earthquake, and having access to Stealth Rock, Gible is absolutely horrible. Dragon-types in Little Cup really lost viability after new Fairy-type contenders such as Swirlix, Spritzee, and Cottonee rose to higher acclaim, and Gible is, honestly, probably the worst Dragon-type of them all. For one, it's 4x weak to Ice, a very common attacking type in Little Cup. It's incompatible with Dragon Dance, making it unable to overcome the issue of its sub-par Speed, and it doesn't even get Swords Dance. Even Noibat, as poor as its base stats are, is a better option for a teamslot than Gible. It does have some interesting attacking options like Iron Head and Hone Claws, and it gets three weather summoning moves in Sunny Day, Rain Dance, and Sandstorm, but it gets nothing even remotely impressive or useful to allow it a niche or a standout feature.</p>

<p>Our unfortunate case of a baby Dragon here is sadly outclassed and overshadowed by every Dragon-type and every Ground-type in Little Cup and there is absolutely no reason to use it unless you're looking to get lucky with Sand Veil misses, but even then, there are better carriers of that ability.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker mattl"><img src="/smog/issue33/viability_mattl.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Garchomp</strong></p>

<p>It's surprising to see Gible struggling in LC because Garchomp has always been a fantastic Pok&eacute;mon in OU and was even banned at one point. Its unique base 102 Speed is nifty, as Pok&eacute;mon with base 100 Speed are not uncommon. To complement its Speed, it has a great base 130 Attack and access to powerful STAB attacks such as Earthquake and Outrage. One thing that sets Garchomp apart is that it's pretty bulky for a Pok&eacute;mon with its Speed and power. Solid 108 / 95 physical bulk is complemented by Rough Skin, which slightly deters the many physical attackers in the tier that use contact moves. Although its Dragon / Ground typing leaves it with a crippling 4x weakness to Ice, it has useful resistances to Rock and Fire and an immunity to Electric, which really helps against Volt Switch users. Garchomp definitely isn't one-dimensional either. It's one of the better users of Stealth Rock, and its high base stats allow it to run either offensive or bulky Stealth Rock sets viably. Swords Dance gives Garchomp insane power and allows it to easily clean up slower, weakened teams. Through forcing switches due to how threatening it is, Substitute, and utilizing its bulk and resistances, Garchomp doesn't have the hardest time finding an opportunity to set up. For immediate power, Garchomp can hold a Choice Band to quickly deal tons of damage or it can use its unique Speed to help it be a good Choice Scarf revenge killer. All of these qualities made Garchomp an excellent Pok&eacute;mon to use in Generation V OU, but why not make one of the best Pok&eacute;mon even better in Gen VI by giving it a Mega Evolution?</p>

<p>Mega Garchomp has a very similar stat spread to Kyurem-B; it has an incredible base 170 Attack and a good base 120 Special Attack. Its base 92 Speed is a decrease but it's still usable, and Mega Garchomp has pretty good bulk. Like Kyurem-B, it can function as a lethal mixed attacker, especially because Garchomp gets Fire Blast. Mega Garchomp can also go for the mind-blowing physical power route with Swords Dance and its new ability, Sand Force. Overall, Garchomp is a fairly versatile, powerful Pok&eacute;mon that is a top threat in OU, even with the introduction of Fairies, and will almost certainly continue to be one for a long time.</p></div>
