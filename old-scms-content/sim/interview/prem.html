<div class="author">Interview by <a href="/forums/members/scene.191866/">Scene</a> and layout by <a href="/forums/members/vacate.189371/">Vacate</a>, interviewing <a href="/forums/members/prem.81322/">prem</a>.</div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>Alright prem, it's good to have you here today. You're widely known as a dedicated Little Cup player and "that anime guy", but we don't know too much about your life outside the realms of Smogon and PS. Who are you and what do you do?</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>So my name is actually Prem. I'm a first year at college studying software engineering, and I have that stereotypical Indian job of tech support.</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>Sounds like you had an easy time picking a username then. Whereabouts are you based, and would you ever see yourself moving in the future?</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>Well I live in California. But nah, I love the weather here. I hate cold weather and I don't plan on leaving lol.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I'm hit with a sudden pang of envy.</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>Over here in Ireland our idea of good weather is when it's not raining - I'm sure it being nice outside opens up a lot more possibilities for your free time. What kind of hobbies do you have, aside from contributing on Smogon?</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>Obviously I read lots of manga and watch lots of anime but other than that, attempting to play competitive Smash Bros Brawl, and cooking. I used to play drums, working out cause I got fat, Yugioh or Puzzle and Dragons too. Cooking is like just something everyone in my family does. I mostly bake cause my brother cooks more often and my mom is afraid to let me cook worrying i will blow something up, so I only cook when I'm alone. Smash, I play Project M [a SBB game mod] a lot with my friends and we actually aren't godawful but I can't wavedash consistently and we like messing around too much to be really good. I played percussion throughout high school but then stopped in college cause lazy. I just learned to do fancy shit that looks nice. Yugioh I used to do a lot but stopped just cause I got into Smash more. Puzzle and Dragons is a phone free to play game that's taken at least 500 dollars from me because it's really addicting and it's basically Pok&eacute;mon + Bejeweled at the same time.</p>

<p>As for anime and manga, myanimelist tells me I've read something like 140 days worth of manga in my life. Anime I just started to actually watch recently so not nearly as much time spent overall, but basically I've pulled all of my allnighters in college because of anime.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I do a slight double-take.</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>140 days? That's quite the time sink, lol. And I'm not sure I want to find out more about that $500, to be honest. Anyway, what aspects of anime do you enjoy, and are there any in particular you'd recommend taking a look at?</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>Aldaron kinda told me I was inhuman during that one year... anyway I don't know, I'm just a person who gets bored really easily and wanted something to kill time and so I got into anime and manga. I honestly just watch and read for entertainment, so before I used to be okay with anything, nowadays I actually care about quality though.</p>

<p>Recommendations are hard because of what genres people are into, like in the Anime and Manga room we made pastebins of general recommendations for basically every genre. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagan would probably be the one that i think most people could enjoy. Manga, I'm going to say One Piece. I know so many people who are like "Big 3 sucks" (Naruto, Bleach and One Piece) and then talk about One Piece anime and it pisses me off because the anime sucks lol. Only One Piece is good though, of those three.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>He nods his head solemnly.??</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>Sounds interesting - I've never got into anime personally, but I know there's some really good stuff out there. Changing tack a little, how exactly did you get into Pok&eacute;mon and Smogon?</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>Pok&eacute;mon I was always kinda into cause playing Yellow as a kid and all, but I got into competitive mons like 6 years ago? Yeah, me and my friend wanted something to do on the bus ride to and from school so we started playing competitive mons and I always looked up sets on Smogon. Then like 4 years ago, around the time BW started, I was told about PO and I kinda started getting into the community there. Then I finally made a forum account cause someone posted something that was just incorrect in C&C and it irritated me because I hate people giving wrong info. So I made an account literally just to tell him he was wrong.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I notice his eyes gleaming as he recalls the occasion with pride.</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>So you started off in C&C setting people straight on their facts - how did you end up where you are today, as a top LC player and long-time PS mod?</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>I got sim mods first in just like 4 months or something because I was on a lot. I mostly just talked a lot, then during the staff revamps on PO I got mods and I've been that for like 4 years now. Then LC, I remember wanting to play that meta cause it looks adorable. My first game was against Al_Alchemist who promptly kicked my ass. Then I learned from ShinyAzelf kinda, with a lot of other people too, and then I started posting a lot and helping in c&c until yeah shit happened: I wasn't bad, I did work. You get places when you do that.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I can't argue with that.</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>Very true. You've come a long way since then - you're even quietly racking up the badges too! What are you up to now, and where do you see yourself contributing in the future?</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>I don't really plan on doing new stuff, basically I'm gonna help out LC all the time cause I love the community and I don't plan on ever leaving Smogon cause the same reason. It's mostly just me doing the same shit, obviously stuff like LC in SPL (Smogon Premier League) is big and tournaments are actually pretty fun so I might get more into that if I have time. Current projects in LC? I think mostly all I've been doing is for Smogcasts and stuff cause I'm mostly a sim mod in the end so I'm always on PS too much work to do extra work.</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>Little Cup is a tier that's unique, but also one that's often... not really treated as a really competitive tier. What drew you to the meta of the baby Pok&eacute;mon?</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>It's really really cute. I like cute things?. Beyond that, it's just a nice smaller community. I've always thought people on Smogon get crazy for stuff like trophies and that the stereotypical "tourney asshole" people were annoying so a nicer community was fun.</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>You've been a Showdown mod for quite a while now. What are the perks and disadvantages of being staff, and what advice would you give to someone looking to rise up the ranks?</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>Disadvantages are definitely getting random pms and being "incapable" of ignoring them. If I lock someone and they start pm spamming me I just kinda have to deal with it, too. Also people expect me to solve the stupidest problems where I'm just like "um it's the internet, man up". Then perks, I don't know it's nice having a symbol next to your name, it's nice being able to help people out when they have problem and it's nice being able to mute and lock. Sounds a little Hitler but HONESTLY, it's so nice when someone does something that's bad and you can be like "bye motherfucker".</p>

<p>My advice is to be a good user but don't be a suck up; you don't need to say hi to every auth that enters and you don't need to follow the rules [I wouldn't take this literally, to all you opportunistic trolls reading this]. Always be a person before that because otherwise you are boring and if the chat is boring then I'm bored and I leave and no one wants that.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I nod in understanding.?</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>Absolutely, having an agreeable personality will get you places in life faster than anything else. Alright, now for the moment everyone's undoubtedly been waiting for since we kicked this off. What's your favourite Pok&eacute;mon?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>He grimaces slightly.</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>Man, I fucking hate this question, lol. Probably Weavile, if only because when I started competitive mons my friend used like 5 dragon teams and I always used Weavile and won solely from CB ice punches.</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>Truly the work of a master. Before we wrap up this interview, do you have any final words you'd like to leave us with?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>We can both just about hear the sound of distressed crying from the vicinity of Naples.</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>No question friend, the people need to know the facts.</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>Yeah.</p></div>

<div class="inter"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/scene.png" alt="scene" /><p>Alright, it was a pleasure interviewing you, prem. Thanks for your time, and good luck in your future endeavors!</p></div>

<div class="intee"><img src="/media/upload/sim/interviews/prem.png" alt="prem" /><p>Thanks, it was fun!</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>We go our separate ways, him humming slightly. I leave both enlightened about just how crappy phone games make money, and slightly bemused this man has enough time in his busy life to even consider holding down a paying job.</p></div>
