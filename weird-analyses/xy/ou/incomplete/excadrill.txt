Rapid Spinner
########
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Rock Slide / Stealth Rock
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Air Balloon / Leftovers
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========
This variant of Excadrill functions as a simple yet effective Rapid Spin user, with the ability to also pose as an offensive threat. Rapid Spin removes all hazards on your side of the field and unlike Defog, it keeps the ones you may have set on your opponents side of the field. Earthquake hits extremely hard, and is capable of hitting Levitate users (such Gengar and Rotom-W) Iron Head is a handy coverage that's useful for damaging most Ground-type resists. It's also extremely effective against Fairy-types. Rock Slide grants coverage against specific Ground-type immune threats who are take little damage from Iron Head (Flying-types such as Thundurus and Talonflame) On the other hand, Excadrill can take advantage of its typing and sheer presence to set up Stealth Rock. Rock Slide or Shadow Claw can be used in the last slot over Stealth Rock as added coverage against specific threats (Flying- and Ghost-types). Swords Dance gives Excadrill enough power to punch through certain walls and Rapid Spin blockers. Toxic can be used in the final slot to get a leg up on several of the Pokemon that counter Excadrill.

Set Details
========
Air Balloon offers Excadrill gives Excadrill a temporary advantage against Ground-type users, while Leftovers provides residual healing. The choice of item comes down to whether you want to have an extra turn against Ground-type users or consistent recovery throughout the match. The choice of nature comes to to Speed over Power. Generally, Jolly's ability to at worst, tie with opposing Excadrill and outspeed max speed Rotom-W makes it significantly more reliable, although Adamant's sheer power can't be understated. A bulkier spread can be used if you don't really care about Speed. Life Orb is a decent alternative if Swords Dance is used.

Usage Tips
========
The general way of using this variant Excadrill is to switch in and Rapid Spin or Stealth Rock if needed, and attack when you have the opportunity. Excadrill excellent typing affords it plenty of opportunities to switch and use Rapid Spin, so feel free to use Pokemon that draw in opposing Pokemon who are vulnerable to Excadrill. You'll generally only be able to off one action major action per switch in (Rapid Spin, Attack, Stealth Rock), and sometimes you'll have to make the hard choice between using Rapid Spin, setting up your own Stealth Rock, or outright attacking. Bulky Ghost-types are a problem if SD/Shadow Claw isn't used; Excadrill won't be of much use until they're removed. Generally, Rapid Spinning is the best option, though the choice of move is entirely up to you. The most important thing to consider is to avoid going being predictable.

Team Options
========
Rotom-W is a useful partner to Excadrill, as it can switch into most of Excadrilll's weaknesses, and beat most of its counters. Garchomp and Tyranitar can lure and take out Excadrill's checks and counters with their secondary sets (Ice Beam from Tyranitar, Mixed Mega Garchomp) You should make the most out of Excadrill's ability to consistently Rapid Spin by pairing it with powerful Stealth Rock weak Pokemon. Examples of these Pokemon include Charizard-Y (who can weaken Water-types with Drought and has excellent synergy with Excadrill), Charizard-X, Thundurus, Mega Pinsir, Dragonite and Talonflame.

Choice Scarf
########
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Rapid Spin
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
-Excadrill's access to Mold Breaker, good Speed and a solid typing make it a desirable Choice Scarf user.
-A fast Mold Breaker Earthquake is very useful, though it's somewhat easy to abuse
-Iron Head & Rock Slide are standard coverage moves. They're fairly weak, but they get the job done against certain targets (Talonflame, Thundurus, Sylveon etc)
-Choiced Rapid Spin might sound counter-intuitive, but its extremely useful at removing hazards against faster paced teams
-Tertiary coverage moves like Return, X-scissor or Brick Break are niche coverage moves that are catered towards being useful against specific threats

Set Details
========
-Jolly is used to outrun Timid Scarf Heatran, +1 Jolly Gyarados, Modest Scarf Genesect and to (at worst) speed tie opposing Choice Scarf Excadrill. The power boost from Adamant is certainly useful, but it's not worth tossing up the ability to potentially outspeed all of those Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========
-Choice Scarf Excadrill is a top notch utility Pokemon; it can check other Pokemon, sweep or even pull off a last ditch Rapid Spin to remove hazards
-That said, it's also rather easy to abuse. Choiced locked Earthquake or weak coverage moves can give your opponent the opportunity to set up or wreak serious damage
-You'll have to either predict all of your attacks or rely on your teammates to deal with Pokemon that counter Choice Scarf Excadrill

Team Options
========
-Rotom-W can cover the Pokemon that can switch in and abuse choice locked Excadrill (ground immunes like Gliscor, Landorus-T, etc)
-Tyranitar and Garchomp that can break through Skarmory, Gliscor and Landorus-T are fantastic partners, as they're both proficient at luring these Pokemon.


Assault Vest
########
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Rock Slide
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Assault Vest
evs:120 HP / 136 Atk / 252 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
After equipping the Assault Vest, Excadrill gains a massive surge in Special Defense which grants it more opportunities to use Rapid Spin. Earthquake is still a fairly strong move despite the comparatively lower Attack investment and it still has the ability to target levitate users. Iron Head and Rock Slide make up Excadrill's coverage moves, and are its best options for dealing with most Ground-type resists. Shadow Claw can be used to deal even more damage against bulky Ghost-types, but the lowered Attack investment and lack of a boosting item makes it a subpar choice in general.

Set Details
========
The EV spread guarantees that Shadow Ball from the standard Aegislash is a 4HKO at best. Most non super effective Special Attacks will barely put a scratch on Excadrill. While the main spread tries to strike a balance between offense and defense, it can always be tweaked to suit your needs. For instance, a spread consisting of 252 Atk / 252 Spe can grant more of an offensive presence, while a spread consistent of 252 HP / 252 SpD Careful can make Excadrill significantly sturdier on the Special Defense side.

Usage Tips
========
Assault Vest Excadrill let's it take on strong Special Attackers (such as Kyurem-B), and more importantly, it allows it to Rapid Spin against foes that would ordinarily OHKO it. An example would be the matchup against Choice Scarf Rotom-W. Ordinarily Excadrill would have to make the decision to switch, or stay in to predict the potential Volt Switch. Assault Vest Excadrill can ignore that element altogether, as Hydro Pump doesn't come close to OHKOing, and Excadrill can Rapid Spin regardless of what the opponent does.


Team Options
========
The same partners for the Rapid Spin set apply as well. Rotom-W is the quintessential Excadrill teammate, as it has an easy time switching into Excadrill's weaknesses, and can take on its checks and counters. Garchomp and Tyranitar can be used to lure and take out Excadrill's checks and counters. Pokemon who appreciate the removal of Stealth Rock make for great partners.


Sand Rush
########
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Rock Slide
move 1: Swords Dance / Rapid Spin
ability: Sand Rush
item: Life Orb / Air Balloon
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========
-The speed gained from Sand Rush turns Excadrill into a potent offensive threat
-The last slot determines how this set is played
-If Swords Dance is used, Excadrill gains the ability to potentially sweep teams
-If Rapid Spin is used, it can provide the entire team with support

Set Details
========
-Adamant vs Jolly, etc etc.
-A bulkier spread can be used if you want bulk and you only care about outspeeding walls
-A Sandstream user equipped with a Smooth Rock is a must

Usage Tips
========
-Excadrill can be used as a revenge killer or lategame sweeper, depending on the state of the match
-Swords Dance Excadrill should look for an opportunity to set up to break walls or cores. Until you find a clear opportunity to set up, it's best to just attack. Attacking on the switch to weaken checks is also encouraged
-Rapid Spin Excadrill should be played as an offensive threat with the ability to spin away hazards when the opportunity presents itself. It's probably best to just keep attacking for the most part, unless your opponent has a Pokemon that completely counters Excadrill

Team Options
========
-Rotom-W for that awesome synergy + the ability to safely bring Excadrill into battle with Volt Switch.
-Tyranitar & Hippowdon equipped with Smooth Rock for Sand Rush sets
