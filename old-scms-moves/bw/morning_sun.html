[SHORT DESC]
Heals user variably depending on the weather.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals the user by 1/2 of its maximum HP if no weather conditions are in effect, 2/3 of its maximum HP if the weather is sun, and 1/4 of its maximum HP if the weather is hail, rain, or sandstorm, all rounded half down.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Morning Sun is somewhat unreliable, as the recovery is cut down by sandstorm and rain, two common weather conditions. Furthermore, it only has 8 maximum PP, which can be easily stalled out. For these reason, not many Pokemon use Morning Sun. However, on a sun team, or if there is no other alternatives, some Pokemon, such as Espeon, may use Morning Sun for healing.</p>
