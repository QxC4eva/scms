<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of +1.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Shadow Sneak, even with low distribution, is a great move on the majority of Pokemon with access to it. While not a very powerful move, it gives much-needed priority to attackers like mixed Giratina-O or physical sweepers like Gallade. Without the priority from Shadow Sneak, the Shadow Sneak user is much easier to revenge kill, as all the Pokemon who have access to Shadow Sneak have low or average Speed. Revenge killers, who otherwise would switch in and take the Shadow Sneak user out without taking a hit, are then forced to take a hit, and the majority of them will take major damage from Shadow Sneak. However, it should be remembered that Shadow Sneak faces some competition as far as priority moves go; it is both weaker and of lower priority than ExtremeSpeed, and it has a poor distribution.</p>
