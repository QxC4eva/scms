[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. It has a 1/3 chance for the move to hit either 2 or 3 times, and a 1/6 chance to hit either 4 or 5 times. If a Focus Sash or the ability Sturdy is activated through one of the hits, another hit will KO the target. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate for every hit taken, and every hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock, Razor Fang, or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. Color Change will only activate on the last hit of the move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat all the hits as a single attack. If this move breaks a Substitute, the attack can still continue and hurt the target. If the target holds a Charti, Jaboca, or Enigma Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. If the user has the ability Skill Link, this move will always hit five times.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The main advantage of Rock Blast over other Rock-type moves is that it can bypass Focus Sash and partially bypass Substitute. This can be especially helpful against Substitute stallers such as SubToxic Zapdos. However, this move has a very low distribution, and it is weaker than Stone Edge on average. Consequently, few Pokemon use it in OU and UU.</p>

<p>Cloyster is the main user of Rock Blast in OU, and with its Skill Link ability, it can use all five hits of the move, causing massive damage to Water- and Ice-types that would otherwise switch in to resist its STABs. In UU, Rhyperior enjoys STAB from Rock Blast, which makes it a nice choice for dealing with Substitute users. In the lower tiers, Cinccino uses Rock Blast because, like Cloyster, it can land all five hits with Skill Link. Powerful Rock-type Pokemon in NU and RU such as Golem also occasionally use Rock Blast to destroy Substitutes. Although a bit risky, Octillery can also use Rock Blast in conjunction with its Sniper ability to increase the chance of landing a critical hit.</p>
