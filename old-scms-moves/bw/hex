<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Base Power doubles if target has a status ailment.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Hex is an interesting move. If the target has a status condition, the move is stronger than Shadow Ball, but much weaker otherwise. This makes Hex somewhat unreliable, but Ghost-types often run Will-O-Wisp, somewhat alleviating this problem. Toxic Spikes complement this move very well, poisoning the opponent's Pokemon as they enter the battlefield. Hex should be used carefully, and complemented by a reliable secondary move.</p>
