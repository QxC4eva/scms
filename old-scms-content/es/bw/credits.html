<p>The Spanish Translations Project is an idea that has been in the works for several months and it has been through exhausting planning. The BW translation project has inherited a lot from the <a href="/es/">DPP project</a>, without which, this one would have been more difficult or it wouldn't have happened at all. As the <a href="/es/credits/">original credits</a> said, without the help of a select few individuals, "the project would not be where it is today. A warm thank you goes out to all of of the people who put forth their time and effort toward releasing this project into the public realm with extraordinary success."</p>

<h2>Heads of the Project</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=17916">RockinX</a></li>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=161822">Joim</a></li>
</ul>
<p>RockinX is the responsible one for coming up with the idea of translating English BW information into Spanish, reviving the old project, he also recruited the whole team for this new project. Joim does the grammar and style checking and gets the content ready for the web page.</p>

<h2>Project Supporters</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=173850">Aza</a></li>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=2446">Death Phenomeno</a></li>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=72478">Ryanor</a></li>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=43632">zero2exe</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These four members have been working hard to translate abilities and items, and now they are working hard to get items done as well. Without their help this project couldn't be possible due to the sheer amount of work.</p>

<h2>Artists</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=29254">Bloo</a></li>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=15181">Cartoons!</a></li>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=62885">Nastyjungle</a></li>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=2231">Zracknel</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Artists always put enormous amounts of effort into their work in order to produce the best possible image. The BW Translation project has reused the old pieces, and that shows how great they are. If you're wondering who did what, then look below:</p>
