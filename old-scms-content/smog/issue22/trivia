<p>Boy, what a year it's been. Plus, we've still got Christmas and Halloween right around the corner! Work doesn't stop here at Smogon for the holidays though. Black 2 and White 2's release has yet to slow down, and we're still busy getting everything up to date and revising content. Feel free to stop by C&amp;C if you think you have what it takes to help out.</p>

<p>Anyway, onto the Trivia! I would like to think that after the easiness of last issue's questions, there'd be some more incentive to participate this time around. Well, let's look at the answers:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>In the water of Route 21 in Kanto of Generation IV, only two Pok&eacute;mon have an encounter rate of less than 5%. What are they?</strong><br />
Using Rods, Shellder and Lanturn are both at 3% encounter rates.</li>
<li><strong>Of Arcanine's Generation V learnset, how many moves have at least 90 Base Power?</strong><br />
16.</li>
<li><strong>In the TCG Expansion Set, Gym Heroes, which Pok&eacute;mon, if any, are featured as belonging to Trainers that never owned them in the video games, anime, or manga?</strong><br />
Erika's Clefairy / Dratini / Dragonair, Lt. Surge's Rattata / Raticate / Spearow / Fearow, Misty's Shellder / Cloyster / Poliwrath / Tentacool / Tentacruel, Sabrina's Venonat / Gastly / Haunter / Gengar, Brock's Lickitung / Sandshrew / Sandslash / Mankey , Blaine's Tauros / Kangashkan.</li>
<li><strong>In which spin-off game(s) does Darkrai play a major role?</strong><br />
Pok&eacute;mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia and PMD: Explorers of Time/Darkness.</li>
<li><strong>Name two Pok&eacute;mon that lose Speed upon evolution.</strong><br />
Caterpie, Magneton, Onix, Scyther, Wurmple, Anorith, Karrablast, and Tynamo are all viable answers.</li>
<li><strong>What is the highest leveled Pok&eacute;mon that you can naturally face in the wild?</strong><br />
100. Magikarp.</li>
<li><strong>How many abilities have no relevance in battle? Name them.</strong><br />
Honey Gather and Illuminate are the only ones now that Stench and Pickup have relevant abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Name all moves that have been TMs for at least two generations, but have since been replaced/removed.</strong><br />
Snatch, Skill Swap, Steel Wing, Secret Power, Iron Tail, Giga Drain, Bullet Seed, Water Pulse, Focus Punch, and Dream Eater.</li>
<li><strong>I'm in Goldenrod City in Generation IV. I've just bought myself two cans of Lemonade, three Ultra Balls, ten Revives, five Max Potions, and one TM38 Fire Blast. How much have I spent?</strong><br />
37300. What a high roller.</li>
<li><strong>Which Pok&eacute;mon has the largest density value?</strong><br />
At 0.6m tall, and an assumed conical shape, combined with a weight of 105kg, Munchlax takes the cake, no pun intended.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Excluding Ubers, if you built a team with the six fastest Pok&eacute;mon in existence, what is the BST of your team?</li>
<li>Assuming all Arceus count as a single Pok&eacute;mon, which ability/abilities is/are the rarest in Ubers?</li>
<li>Name three Pok&eacute;mon that have made appearances in TCG World Championships finals that have never been in OU by Smogon standards.</li>
<li>Name all the Pok&eacute;mon that can be captured within the Ranger School grounds (of Ranger: Shadows of Almia) without the use of any Target Clear Field Assists.</li>

</ol>
