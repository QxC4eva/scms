[Overview]

<p>Nidoqueen is a decent Pokemon. It is basically a Nidoking with better defenses but worse offenses. The better defenses do not outweigh the disadvantage of having worse attacking stats, and hence it is generally considered less useful than Nidoking.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Blizzard
move 3: Thunderbolt / Thunder
move 4: Body Slam

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is basically the same set as that of Nidoqueen's male counterpart, Nidoking. To use this set best, try to predict if your opponent will switch something in against Nidoqueen, and try to damage the switched in Pokemon with super effective attacks. Nidoqueen can cover some of her weaknesses with Blizzard for Exeggutor, Thunderbolt or Thunder for Starmie, and Body Slam for Alakazam.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Surf works great against Rhydon and Golem, and Rock Slide is nice against Flying-types like Moltres, Charizard, and Articuno--although it won't faint the latter. Ice Beam is an alternative to Blizzard if you prefer more PP and accuracy, but less power. Horn Drill can be used if OHKO moves aren't banned, but that isn't likely.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Exeggutor is not deterred by Blizzard, and can shoot STAB Psychics in Nidoqueen's direction if it doesn't switch out. Alakazam and Starmie both are good counters, though Starmie fears a super effective Thunder. Articuno can switch in on almost everything, as even Thunder is not enough to strike fear into its massive Special. Jynx can also switch in on Nidoqueen's special moves, but not on Earthquake, so be sure of which move it is switching into. Since Nidoqueen is so similar to Nidoking, Lapras and Vaporeon work well as counters too.</p>
