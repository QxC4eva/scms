<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Little Cup lore once told of the existence of a Pok&eacute;mon so powerful that even its counters ran in fear. This Pok&eacute;mon had three amazing abilities, coverage capable of razing villages, incredible Speed, and also boasted the highest mixed attacking stats in the metagame. That Pok&eacute;mon was none other than Murkrow, destroyer of worlds. Murkrow had so many different sets it was near impossible to count. It could smash about using an all-out attacker set with Life Orb, serve as a team supporter thanks to the Prankster ability, or beat its enemies down with luck with by running its Swagplay or Parafusion sets. However, Murkrow's power got the best of it this generation, and its LC reign of terror ended when it was banned from the metagame. As Murkrow was capable of doing so much, this banning left a hole in many players' hearts (and teams!). This hole would be filled by all the new Flying-type Pok&eacute;mon who were once outclassed by the big black crow. Murkrow's banning brought on a regime of birds and other Flying-types. Truly, you must keep your eyes on the sky, lest you let your precious Pok&eacute;mon take a Brave Bird to the face.</p>

<h3>Fletchling</h3>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/fletchling.gif" alt="" />
<p>Fletchling is undoubtedly one of the most threatening and useful Pok&eacute;mon in the current metagame. Although its base stats are average at best, the incredible utility of a priority flying-type 110 Base Power move in the form of Gale Wings Acrobatics is hard to match. Fletchling also has a solid movepool that allows it to pose as even more of a threat. It is able to use coverage moves such as Overheat to roast Steel-types that would otherwise wall it, and Return is a great secondary STAB attack; Natural Gift is another interesting option, because in conjunction with an Apicot or a Liechi Berry, it is able to serve as a one-time use 100 Base Power Ground-type or Grass-type attack, respectively. Swords Dance allows Fletchling to boost its Attack to much more threatening levels and makes it easier to sweep, while priority Roost provides Fletchling with reliable recovery, which is especially useful when considering that Fletchling is weak to Stealth Rock. A popular strategy for Fletchling revolves around U-turn and Diglett as a teammate; many Pok&eacute;mon commonly used to combat Fletchling, such as Chinchou and Pawniard, are weak to Diglett's STAB Earthquake. This means Fletchling is able to U-turn out when a switch to one of these Pok&eacute;mon is predicted, allowing Diglett to come in and trap and KO Fletchling's counters; this grants Fletchling a much easier time sweeping later on. As for choices of items, leaving Fletchling itemless is the standard to grant it the revenge killing prowess it needs with Acrobatics right from the start, but Berry Juice could be used to help Fletchling set up, while Apicot or Liechi Berry could be used in conjunction with Natural Gift for coverage.</p>
<p>Fletchling is far from perfect, of course, because at the end of the day, its stats are still somewhat low. 45/43/38 defenses mean that without significant defensive investment and sometimes even with it, strong, unresisted STAB attacks will take off a hefty chunk of Fletchling's HP; if Fletchling is weak to a decently powerful attack, it will be lucky to survive at all. Crippling Fletchling survivability further is are its weaknessesto Stealth Rock and the fairly common e Electric-type attacks. Base 50 Attack isn't all that notable, either; it actually leaves itemless Fletchling unable to OHKO Eviolite Scraggy, meaning many of the Pok&eacute;mon Fletchling wants to revenge kill will have to be weakened first. Despite its drawbacks, Fletchling remains a phenomenal sweeper and revenge killer that absolutely must be prepared for if a team is to succeed in the current Little Cup metagame.</p>

<h3>Archen</h3>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/archen.gif" alt="" />
<p>This prehistoric bird's claim to fame is its secondary Rock typing, which gives it an all-important resistance to Flying-type attacks, allowing Archen to laugh at its fellow birds like Fletchling and Doduo. Additionally, Archen's Flying typing gives it an edge over Ground-types, most notably Diglett, which is sometimes used alongside Fletchling to pick off Chinchou. Archen's movepool extends as long as a Brontosaurus's neck, containing great support moves such as Stealth Rock, Knock Off, Defog, and U-turn. Archen's support options are almost unrivaled in the tier; it is able to build momentum, cripple foes with Knock Off, and provide hazards to combat offensive teams as well as help its own team offensively.</p>
<p>Archen isn't all defense however; it hits a staggering 22 Attack, so it hits as hard as a Tyrannosaurus Rex. One of Archen's offensive sets includes the use of Head Smash in tandem with Berry Juice. Normally, recoil moves aren't the best, especially on a Pok&eacute;mon with the awful Defeatist ability, but Berry Juice makes it work. After one or two Head Smashes, Archen is put into Berry Juice's activation range, restoring it back to full health and powering up Acrobatics. One interesting tactic includes the use of Rock Tomb. Since most of Archen's checks, like Pawniard and Chinchou, rely on their Speed, crippling them by slowing them down with this technique puts Archen in a position to KO with a powerful Earthquake.</p>
<p>Archen does have its shortcomings, however. As mentioned before, Defeatist is a downright terrible ability that hinders both offensive and defensive sets, so Roost is almost mandatory on any set that doesn't have Berry Juice. While Archen's Rock typing does come in handy when countering other birds, it also grants it a nasty weakness to Pawniard, as well as a neutrality to Fighting- and Grass-type attacks. Archen also has an unfortunate weakness to Stealth Rock; when all is said and done, Archen has a bit of a hard time switching in to anything that doesn't have wings and chirp.</p>

<h3>Doduo</h3>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/doduo.gif" alt="" />
<p>Doduo falls short of the 19 Speed tier, meaning it is outsped by notable threats such as Misdreavus, Abra, and Ponyta, and only has Quick Attack as priority in addition to not having any way to simultaneously boost its Attack and Speed, rendering it questionable as a sweeper. However, it more than makes up for its inability to sweep through sheer power. A Life Orb-boosted Brave Bird coming off base 85 Attack 2HKOes every Pok&eacute;mon that doesn't resist it except for a few of the absolute bulkiest. Things that can withstand Brave Bird won't be walling Doduo for long, however; Doduo packs a massive niche over many other Flying-types in the form of Knock Off. A combination of Life Orb-boosted Knock Off + Brave Bird is able to KO even defensive behemoths such as Lickitung and Slowpoke after one layer of hazards. Life Orb-boosted Quick Attack may not be particularly impressive, but it's not exactly weak, being able to 2HKO standard 0 HP/92 Def Fletchling if Stealth Rock is in play. Doduo makes a wonderful partner to Fletchling, luring in counters to Fletchling such as Chinchou and Archen and pummeling them with a combination of Knock Off and a STAB move such as Brave Bird or Return, although Stealth Rock is necessary to KO Eviolite Archen. Life Orb is usually Doduo's item of choice, giving it the power it needs to decimate walls, but Choice Scarf can be alternatively used for the element of surprise.</p>
<p>Doduo is, unfortunately, even frailer than Fletchling, sporting frankly atrocious 35/45/35 defensive stats; this means even Roost won't help its case in most circumstances. In addition to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Doduo is incredibly reliant on Brave Bird as its main STAB move, since Drill Peck's base damage is often underwhelming and will leave Doduo more prone to taking actual hits. Not only this, but Doduo usually runs Life Orb so it is able to attain quite a few important KOs; all of these add up to a Pok&eacute;mon that is unlikely to last on the battlefield for very long if it has to take damage. A combination of Doduo's frailty and lack of sweeping prowess relegates it to the role of a wallbreaker, although it is certainly very effective at its job if played to its strengths.</p>

<h3>Vullaby</h3>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/vullaby.gif" alt="" />
<p>Vullaby has been one of the metagame's premier defensive Pok&eacute;mon since the BW era. She remains in her position as a defensive stalwart in the current generation thanks to her excellent bulk and huge support movepool, containing gems such as Taunt, Knock Off, Tailwind, and Defog. Now with Murkrow banned, Vullaby is the only Dark / Flying type in the metagame, and this unique combination allows her to put pressure on otherwise threatening Pok&eacute;mon like Mienfoo and Pawniard. Vullaby's ability Overcoat got a nice buff this generation as well, now granting an immunity to spore-and powder-based moves; this gives her the edge over Foongus and Cottonee, so long as the latter isn't running Dazzling Gleam. STAB Knock Off has proven to be a reliable force to be reckoned with, and Vullaby makes full use of the support it provides the team. Overall, Vullaby is a competent defensive Pok&eacute;mon capable of checking a lot of threats.</p>
<p>However, Vullaby can also go on the offensive. While her attacking stats aren't exactly threatening, she has a number of merits. For one, Vullaby has access to an excellent boosting move in Nasty Plot, which works nicely with her great special coverage in Dark Pulse, Heat Wave, and Air Slash. Vullaby doesn't need Nasty Plot to deal damage, however, as she can launch out the powerful Brave Bird. The combination of Knock Off and Brave Bird can apply a fair bit of pressure, especially with STAB on both moves, and she can use Heat Wave to round out the coverage, though Vullaby is not a very potent mixed attacker. Finally, Vullaby's hidden ability, Weak Armor, makes up for her rather low Speed. The speed boost that Weak Armor grants is enough to let Vullaby put pressure on important Pok&eacute;mon like the aforementioned Mienfoo or Pawniard. Vullaby works well at clearing the way for other sweepers to sweep, as many common Flying-counter switch-ins to Flying-types will not appreciate the nasty attacks that Vullaby can shell out. That leaves only Chinchou standing in the way of your feathered victory.</p>
<p>Vullaby is not a perfect Pok&eacute;mon, however. As mentioned before, her offensive stats are a tad low, and she will often find herself too weak or too slow to make good use of her coverage. Additionally, a weakness to Stealth Rock makes life hard for any Pok&eacute;mon, and Vullaby generally has a hard time dealing with Pawniard if she doesn't have Heat Wave. The new Fairy-types only adds to the list of Vullaby's problems, providing Pok&eacute;mon that she would otherwise beat, like Misdreavus or Cottonee, with tools to take it down. It's a hard life out there for a half-hatched vulture, but a well-played Vullaby manages to fulfill her niche and soar high with it.</p>

<h3>Taillow</h3>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/taillow.gif" alt="" />
<p>it is still extremely threatening; boosted Facade coming off 22 Attack hurts, to say the least. Taillow also has Brave Bird to hit Ghost-types with (although keep in mind that it doesn't OHKO Eviolite Misdreavus), with Quick Attack to revenge kill weakened threats and Protect to reliably activate the status Orb. Alternatively, Taillow can opt to don either a Choice Specs or a Choice Scarf and fire off Scrappy Boombursts; Taillow's low base Special Attack is made up for by the Base Power of Boomburst. Heat Wave is incompatible with Boomburst so Hidden Power Fighting is usually used over Heat Wave instead, while Air Slash is nice as a secondary STAB move. Both variants of Taillow are very difficult to switch into unless the opposing Pok&eacute;mon resists both of Taillow's STABs; the Choice Specs set can deal with a few of these with a bit of prediction thanks to Hidden Power Fighting, and Taillow also has U-turn to maintain momentum against these counters, since it outspeeds all of them unless they run a Choice Scarf. Taillow may lack ways to get past resistances, but otherwise, the raw damage it is able to dish out is difficult to match.</p>
<p>Taillow, like other popular Normal / Flying types in the current metagame, is quite difficult to keep alive, and is actually frailer than both Fletchling and Doduo while retaining the same defensive shortcomings. Its biggest weakness is its inability to break through common Rock-and Steel-types unless they are doubly weak to Hidden Power Fighting in the case of Choice Specs Taillow, such as Pawniard, or are simply innately frail, such as Berry Juice Magnemite. Regardless, once Pok&eacute;mon that are able to wall Taillow are eliminated, Taillow makes for a very potent sweeper, whether alone or as a partner-in-crime to the more widespread Fletchling.</p>

<h3>Wingull</h3>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/wingull.gif" alt="" />
<p>Oh... Wingull. It has never really been a popular Pok&eacute;mon in the metagame, its usage stats typically hovering around the "does anyone actually use this" area. However, Wingull certainly has enough merits to stand out and warrant its use on offensive teams. First off, Wingull reaches the amazing 19 Speed tier, letting it outspeed most unboosted Pok&eacute;mon. Wingull also has access to Hurricane, a staggeringly powerful STAB move that also has a chance to confuse the target. Wingull shines the most when in the rain, where its aforementioned Hurricane can be spammed with 100% accuracy and its Water STAB gets a solid boost in power. Flying and Water get great coverage together as well, which makes countering Wingull that much harder. Wingull's ability, Rain Dish, lets it run a Life Orb without having to worry too much about chip damage wearing it down. Finally, it also has access to U-turn, allowing it to maintain momentum or escape before it is picked off.</p>
<p>Wingull does face its problems, though. Its Special Attack stat sits at a mediocre base 55, so it has a tough time getting past some bulkier Pok&eacute;mon, even with its high powered attacks. Additionally, Wingull is extremely frail, so setting up is no easy task, as it will be hit hard by nearly every attack, even unstabbed. Wingull's life is made much harder by the existence of Chinchou, which walls both its STABs and can strike back for a clean OHKO with its Electric-type attacks. It's actually pretty ironic, considering seagulls are usually the ones seen snacking on fish.</p>

<h2>Counters</h2>
<p>Strategies revolving around utilizing multiple birds for offensive synergy are popular for a reason, of course; they tend to be extremely effective. Pok&eacute;mon such as Chinchou, who might be able to take on Fletchling alone, have far more difficulty withstanding multiple powerful attacks over the course of a match from the rest of Fletching's flock in addition to the possibility of a Diglett teammate, and once the counters to the birds are eliminated, even if at the cost of one of the birds, the rest of the birds can proceed to clean up. That being said, bird offense is by no means unbeatable, as there are several huge roadblocks to teams based around these cores.</p>

<h3>Stealth Rock</h3>
<p>Birds are Flying-type, and Flying-types are weak to Stealth Rock. Many bird offense strategies revolve around U-turn, so Stealth Rock severely hinders switching. The easiest way to combat Stealth Rock would be with a Rapid Spinner or a Defogger. Archen and Vullaby are both solid Flying-types with access to Defog; on the other hand, Drilbur can cover the Rock-type weaknesses of its teammates while spinning away hazards.</p>

<h3>Archen</h3>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/archen.gif" alt="" />
<p>One of the biggest threats to birds is actually a bird itself. Archen resists the Flying and Normal STABs of Fletchling, Doduo, and Taillow, as well as U-turn, and is immune to Diglett's Arena Trap thanks to its Flying typing. Access to Roost means whittling Archen down is easier said than done. In return, Archen can hit hard with an astonishing base 112 Attack and be a massive nuisance in general with its remarkable supportive movepool. You could try getting rid of Archen's item early on to make it easier to wear out, but it will often come down to the bird core's teammates to deal with this threat.</p>

<h3>Tirtouga</h3>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/tirtouga.gif" alt="" />
<p>Whether offensive or defensive, Tirtouga is a solid check to bird offense. High base Defense allows Tirtouga to withstand both resisted and neutral assaults with ease and force the birds out with the threat of STAB Rock-type attacks. Thanks to Solid Rock, Eviolite, and an innately high base 103 Defense, defensive Tirtouga only barely gets 3HKOed by 20 Attack Archen's Earthquake. Diglett isn't enough to deal with Tirtouga because offensive Tirtouga variants often carry Aqua Jet, while defensive Tirtouga is so bulky that it can actually avoid the 2HKO from Focus Sash Diglett more often than not, allowing it to easily KO in return with a combination of Scald and Aqua Jet. Luckily, Tirtouga rarely has any way to recover its HP outside of the one-time use Berry Juice for offensive variants, meaning it can simply be worn down over the course of the match, preferably with the help of U-turn and a few checks or counters to the turtle.</p>

<h3>Porygon</h3>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/porygon.gif" alt="" />
<p>Although Porygon doesn't actually resist Flying-type STAB, physically defensive Eviolite variants can still do well against bird cores. Respectable physical bulk allows Porygon to avoid the 2HKO from unboosted attacks from most Fletchling and Archen, although Doduo and Taillow have high enough damage outputs to overwhelm Porygon for the 2HKO. Porygon isn't a sitting duck to these birds, because Ice Beam from a nice base 85 Special Attack is able to do heavy damage. Recover is helpful to prevent Porygon from being whittled down throughout the match, while Thunder Wave can be used to significantly cripple birds that don't rely on priority. Especially powerful Pok&eacute;mon such as the aforementioned Doduo and Taillow are probably the easiest way to get rid of Porygon, but it must be done very carefully.</p>

<h3>Chinchou</h3>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/chinchou.gif" alt="" />
<p>With its STAB Volt Switch, Chinchou is able to put birds in a less than desirable position. If the bird switches out, then Chinchou is able to Volt Switch to the appropriate teammate and gain momentum for its team, while if the bird stays in, it takes a super-effective attack to the face. In addition, Diglett tends to have difficulty directly switching in for fear of Chinchou's Water-type attacks, often forcing it to go for the revenge kill instead, or rely on risky predictions to get in safely; of course, sacrificing a Pok&eacute;mon to eliminate Chinchou so your birds can sweep unhindered is often worth it. Luckily, Chinchou's only forms of recovery are Rest and Berry Juice, although both are quite popular; this means that in conjunction with its low base Defense, Chinchou can be taken out through brute force, especially from the likes of Doduo or Taillow. Coverage moves such as Natural Gift on Fletchling or Earthquake on Archen can serve to lure in and crush Chinchou, while if the Chinchou user plays carelessly, Diglett support can also deal with it rather easily.</p>

<h3>Others</h3>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/magnemite.gif" alt="" />
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/amaura.gif" alt="" />
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/aron.gif" alt="" />
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/nosepass.gif" alt="" />
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/tyrunt.gif" alt="" />
<p>Many less popular Electric-and Rock-type Pok&eacute;mon are able to hold their own against certain birds. These include but are not limited to Magnemite, Amaura, Aron, Nosepass, and Tyrunt. However, they are often weak to a combination of U-turn from a bird and Diglett support. Steel-type Pok&eacute;mon such as Pawniard and Magnemite suffer from this as well and are also susceptible to common coverage moves on the more popular birds, such as Overheat from Fletchling or Earthquake from Archen. Multiple birds on the offensive will usually be able to wear a check out as well if it lacks recovery. Outside of resistances, only the bulkiest of walls are usually able to take on repeated bird assaults, but many of them struggle to do much in return, especially if the bird in question runs recovery, often leaving them as setup bait to bulkier birds; they also tend to be 2HKOed by Doduo or Taillow regardless.</p>
