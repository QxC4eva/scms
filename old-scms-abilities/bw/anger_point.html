Raises Attack to +6 if struck by a critical hit.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the wielder is struck by a critical hit, its Attack is raised by +12 (meaning that even if its Attack has a negative stat drop, it will be maximized to +6). This ability will not activate if the wielder is behind a <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>We all hate hax, so Anger Point allows you to turn an unfortunate critical hit to your advantage, giving you a Pokemon with +6 Attack and your opponent a real headache. This relies upon your actually surviving said critical hit, which is easier said than done. Indeed, most of the Pokemon who this applies to are so frail that a critical hit from almost anything will inevitably KO or cripple them. Oh, and this is ignoring the minuscule chance of this ability activating in the first place, which is, on average, 6.25% per attack. Thus, this ability should never be competitively used in singles. In double or triple battles, there are strategies employed that involve the use of Anger Point, where Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/tauros">Tauros</a> or <a href="/bw/pokemon/primeape">Primeape</a> are partnered with Pokemon with <a href="/bw/moves/frost_breath">Frost Breath</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/storm_throw">Storm Throw</a>, both of which guarantee a critical hit.</p>
