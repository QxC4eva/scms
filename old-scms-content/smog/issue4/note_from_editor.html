<p>Nintendo can be cruel sometimes, releasing perhaps the greatest-awaited games just in time for school. These long anticipated remakes were met with hopeful "what ifs" whetted by teasers and expectations for months. And finally, after many years, many players once again crossed the language barrier to return back to the land of nostalgia, Johto.</p>

<p>While the advent of Heart Gold and Soul Silver was quite less dramatic competitively than their rumors or even Platinum, we at The Smog are proud to show you what to expect from these games when they cross the shores next Spring. Of course, this is not to say that we don't have other tricks to treat you with&mdash;we still have our usual columns, courtesy of the many contributors who have stepped up to the plate.</p> 

<p>Meanwhile, you may realize that Smogon now has an <a href="/ingame/">In-Game</a> section, a fruition of many weeks of work from many contributors. You may also realize that it's almost time for the Smogon Awards, an annual popularity contest. Next, you may have realized that The Smog is out two weeks earlier than it should be, meaning that the transition to a monthly web-zine is going along well. This means that we'll be seeing all of you more and more often, hopefully with as much content as always. Finally, remember that The Smog is always looking for your contributions!</p>
