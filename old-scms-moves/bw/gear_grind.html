[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and always hits twice unless the target is KOed by the first hit. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate twice, and this move can KO through Focus Sash and Sturdy. If the first hit breaks a Substitute, the attack will continue to damage the target. Each hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. If the target holds a Babiri, Jaboca, or Enigma Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat both hits as a single attack, and Color Change will only activate on the second hit of the move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Klinklang is the sole user of this move, and as it is the only physical STAB option for it to use, all of its physical sets should use it. It can be useful to break Substitutes or bypass the protecting effects of Focus Sash and Sturdy.</p>
