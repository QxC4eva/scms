<p>This is my first warstory, so please be considerate and understanding, so, I hope you like it! :)</p>

<h1>Part One - Preparation</h1>
<p>It started about two months ago, I was lurking around smogon to find suggestions for a rain dance VGC team, and I eventually found one a little like this:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Kyogre</td><td>Ludicolo</td></tr>
<tr><td>@ Rindo Berry</td><td>@ Leftovers</td></tr>
<tr><td>252 HP /252 SAtk /4 SDef</td><td>252 HP /252 SAtk /4 Spd</td></tr>
<tr><td>Quiet</td><td> Modest</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>- Surf
- Thunder
- Blizzard
- Protect</pre></td>
<td><pre>- Grass Knot
- Surf
- Fake Out
- Protect</pre></td></tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr><td>Metagross</td><td>Palkia</td></tr>
<tr><td>@ Focus Sash</td><td>@ Haban Berry</td></tr>
<tr><td>252 HP /252 Atk /4 Spd</td><td>252 SAtk /252 Spd/4 HP</td></tr>
<tr><td>Adamant</td><td>Modest</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>- Bullet Punch
- Explosion
- Hammer Arm
- Protect</pre></td>
<td><pre>- Spacial Rend
- Surf
- Thunder
- Protect</pre></td></tr>
</table>

<p>So I tested it out on PBR, (My wifi won't let me connect to the DS) and whan I fought some VGC teams, I realized that I need to change it. I switched this pokemon for Palkia:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Gratina-O</td></tr>
<tr><td>@ Griseous Orb</td></tr>
<tr><td>252 HP /252 Atk /4 Spd</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hasty (For speed)</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>- Shadow Force
- Shadow Sneak
- Dragon Claw
- Protect</pre></td></tr>
</table>

<p>I also decided to switch the order around too, so here it is!</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Giratina</td><td>Ludicolo</td></tr>
<tr><td>Kyogre</td><td>Palkia</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Now that I've finalized the team, now for the fun part! :)</p>

<h2>Part Two - The Road Trip</h2>
<p>After I posted my goodbyes, I hit the road with:</p>

<pre>(Car Order)
Mom Ahn
Little Sister Alison-Friend
Me Joseph-Friend</pre>

<p>So, we drove for about 1 hr, ate Chinese, drove 5 hrs and stayed at the Embassy Suites somewhere in Atlanta, and slept until 6AM the next day.
I'd like to mention that I slept on a couch and got 4 hrs less sleep than I would like to have.</p>

<h2>Part Three - Junior Tournament</h2>
<p>Joseph and I eventually got out of bed, and went on our way. When we got there, I was bored, so I decided to challenge tis 10-year old to a battle, and embarraslingly lost. I realized that he was either really good, or horrible when his Tyranitar thundered my Kyogre for 2/5ths of my health.</p>

<p>After convincing myself not to tear his head off, I watched Joseph mingle into the registration line. I didn't watch his first match because I was talking to who I would later know as Curtis and Micah- two seniors with noting better to do. I just witnessed him winning the second round, suprised that his sunny day team that I slapped on him made it this far. Later, I watched his third game which was a win, and lastly, the round before the finals: All I remember was that he was facing another sunny day team, he could've won if his groudon earthquaked his heatran instead of erupting it. So now that the junior's round was over, I had to find a place in line.</p>

<h2>Part Three - Senior Registration</h2>
<p>Luckily, Curtis let me wait in the front of the line with him. Later, he told me that he camped out at the last VGC and never got a chance to play because of the raffling system. After that I battled 3 seniors and beat them all. Then it was registration time. I could feel my heart pounding out of my chest as I accused everyone I saw of being Alaka.</p>

<p>Then it was fight time.</p>

<h2>Part Four - Senior Tournament</h2>
<h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>My first match was against some african-american almost my age, the only thing I recalled was that he cussed each time I knocked out his pokemon. 2-0</p>

<h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>For this match, I was paired with Curtis, who led with weavile and persian, and used jumpluff and mewtwo as backup. At first, I thought I was dead for sure, but when I realized that I had won, I was so relived. 4-0</p>

<h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>This time I was paired with someone I met in line named David. Now this was my most epic match. He led with weavile and Gyrados, I planned to protect ludicolo, and shadow force Gyrados, That worked perfectly, next turn, he sent out ryquaza, and switched weavile for salamence. I switched out giratina for kyogre- bad move. His ryquaza OHKOed kyogre with dragon claw. Then, I sent out metagross, I knew that ryquaza could OHKO meta, so I had ludicolo fake out ryquaza and meta use explosion. It destroyed evrything. We both sent out our last poke- my giratina vs his weavile. after 2 shadow sneaks and a night slash, I realized that I had won! :D 1-0</p>

<h3>Round 4</h3>
<p>All I remember is that I faced a guy with a wii shirt on who was SO confident about winning. I recall that he had a metagross that used trick on ludicolo. 3-0</p>

<p>So now, I was the FIRST FINALIST! XD I crashed into the nearist chair and thanked the lord. After that we ate some pizza, and came back to see the other finalists. I remember-Alaka, Tichu, Blades, Mattj, and some others. Then we picked energy cards- purple for 1 match till top 16, and green for two matches, unfortunately, I picked green. :(</p>

<h3>Round 5</h3>
<p>I faced some 20 yr. old man in some nice-looking clothes who led with mewtwo and abomasnow. This is my current battle video. 1-0</p>

<h3>Round 6 Albinoloon vs. Alaka</h3>
<p>The person here who I looked up on, and feared greatly, Alaka was my biggest threat here. We shook hands, talked a little and started the match. He led with Kyogre and Abomasnow. I shadow forced his abomasnow for 93% of it's health, and got ludicolo killed. Next up was Kyogre, we both traded thunders, and a failed shadow sneak. He blizzarded me and shared me, killing both giratina and kyogre,and then I knew that I had lost. 0-2</p>

<p>So, I watched the rest, got a picture with Alaka, and headed home.</p>
<p>I hope you liked my warstory! </p>
