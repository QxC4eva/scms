<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to burn the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Fire Blast is a reasonably strong offensive option for Pokemon requiring power and good coverage in one move. Unlike other moves with a Base Power of 120, most of which have even lower accuracy, Fire Blast also has an adequate 85% chance of hitting the opponent, which is a fair trade-off considering Flamethrower, another similar move, has perfect accuracy yet less power. It also has a nice 30% burn chance, meaning you are going to cripple physical attackers often. However, Fire-types are not that good in RBY, the best one available being Moltres, who is UU, so the move is not seen much anyways.</p>
