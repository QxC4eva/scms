[Overview]

<p>Wormadam is one of the many forgotten Pokemon that reside in NU. Any natural bulk it might have had as a result of its passable defenses is neutered by its poor HP; Wormadam's other stats range from mediocre to awful. Additionally, its typing does it few favors, granting it an unfortunate weakness to Stealth Rock and a variety of common attacking types, including a 4x weakness to Fire- and Flying-type moves. As if life was not difficult enough for the bagworm, its movepool is incredibly shallow. As a result, stronger Grass-types such as Exeggutor outclass Wormadam, as it can do little to differentiate itself from the rest.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Wormadam, although incapable of taking hits as it is, can still pull off a somewhat effective offensive set. Choice Specs grants Wormadam great power and Leaf Storm is the perfect move to abuse it with, thanks to its astronomical Base Power. Giga Drain heals some of the damage that Wormadam has taken while still packing a respectable punch. Signal Beam is Wormadam's secondary STAB move; additionally, it scores a super effective hit on Grass-types such as Tangela that resist Wormadam's primary STAB moves. Hidden Power Ice gives Wormadam a way to deal with Altaria, while Hidden Power Rock does the same but gives Wormadam an option against Fire-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature maximize Wormadam's Special Attack and its bulk; the 4 EVs that remain are put into its better defensive stat. Wormadam appreciates support from Rapid Spinners such as Armaldo and Torkoal; the fewer entry hazards it has to deal with, the longer it lives. Fire-types burn Wormadam to a crisp; as a result, it appreciates the aid of Pokemon that can sponge Fire-type movesâ€”Camerupt, for example.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Wormadam can use Toxic to damage walls that it otherwise has trouble with. A set consisting of Toxic / Protect / Giga Drain / Synthesis is possible, but a bit too hopeful. Shadow Ball hits Misdreavus hard and does not force Wormadam into Leaf Storm, which lowers the chance that Wormadam will become setup fodder. Endeavor can be used as a last ditch attempt at inflicting damage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fire-types pose an issue for Wormadam in general; however, for all of them bar Flareon, switching into Leaf Storm twice means death, especially with Stealth Rock up. Bulky Ice-types, such as Regice and Articuno, simply ignore Wormadam unless it has Hidden Power Rock. In a tier as slow as NU, where Pokemon with base 40 Speed run rampant, Wormadam is unlucky enough to be the holder of a particularly awful 36 base Speed, meaning that almost every Pokemon with a super effective move has a shot at KOing the bagworm. In general, after Wormadam uses its first Leaf Storm, it loses a lot of its bite and becomes setup fodder for anything that resists Grass-type moves.</p>
