[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user goes to sleep for two turns, restores all HP, and is cured of burn, paralysis, and poison but still retains any negative effects due to status until it switches out. Rest does not cure confusion, nor does it remove the Leech Seed status. The move will fail if the user's HP is full, has 511 below max HP, 255 below max HP, or no HP.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Though Rest's effects are phenomenal, the two-turn sleep it requires is usually far too long for competitive use when used alone. To remedy this, the move is often paired with Amnesia, Reflect, Light Screen, or a combination thereof, helping the user take little damage in the idling turns. The most famous users of this tactic are Snorlax and Slowbro, who boost their Special with Amnesia and then use Rest, since they have very good natural bulk. It's an excellent key move for any defensive Pokemon without access to Recover or Softboiled. This move is also the only way to get rid of status, something very powerful in RBY as a paralysis can be game-changing.</p>
