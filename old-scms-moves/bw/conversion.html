Changes user into a new type based on the user's moves.

[LONG DESC]

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user's type changes to match the original type of one of its four moves besides this move, at random, but not either of its current types. Fails if the user cannot change its type, or if this move would only be able to select one of the user's current types. Weather Ball and Hidden Power are considered Normal-type moves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Conversion isn't commonly used in competitive play because it is inconsistent and ineffective. You may not change into the type you wanted, and nothing stops your opponent from switching to a different counter based on the type you turned into.</p>
