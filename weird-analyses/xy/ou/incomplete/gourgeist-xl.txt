
Overview
########

    Amongst the bulkiest of available spinblockers
    Unique Grass / Ghost typing and very good physical bulk allows it to consistently counter arguably the best OU Rapid Spinner that is Excadrill
    Has access to Will-O-Wisp to be tank physical hits even better
    Has Frisk to scout opponents
    Possesses several useful resists
    Plagued by several weaknesses
    Crippled by status
    Lacks good recovery
    Very slow
    Offensive movepool wasted due to misplaced stats
    Trevenant has better recovery and thus deals with the Water-type Rapid Spinners better, and Gourgeist-S can outspeed its main nemesis Excadrill.


Defensive Spinblocker
########

Name: Defensive Spinblocker
move 1: Will-O-Wisp
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Pain Split / Protect
move 4: Seed Bomb / Shadow Sneak
ability: Frisk
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

    Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and racks up passive damage.
    Leech Seed provides both quick healing and racks up passive damage with Will-O-Wisp
    Pain Split can do damage and heal Gourgeist-XL simultaneously, while any residual damage the foe incurs puts Gourgeist-XL at a health advantage
    Protect can scout a Choiced opponent's attack (which Gourgeist-XL can identify by Frisking), or stall for a turn to inflict more residual damage
    Seed Bomb hits the common spinners for at least neutral damage, and is Gourgeist-XL's most reliable attack
    Shadow Sneak is for priority, which can finish off weakened foes that nearly succumb to burns and/or Leech Seed


Set Details
========

    Maximum physical bulk gives Gourgeist-XL the best chance of beating Swords Dance Excadrill one-on-one, and also allows it to handle such attackers as Garchomp and Azumarill
    A specially bulky spread could handle Water-types and Electric-types better, but this would weaken the Swords Dance Excadrill matchup and Gourgeist-XL generally has little business taking on special attackers since burns do not affect their power


Usage Tips
========

    Gourgeist-XL spinblocks Excadrill very well, so it pairs well with hazards setters. Greninja can use Spikes while Tyranitar can use Stealth Rock
    They even have good defensive synergy with Gourgeist-XL as they resist Fire, Ghost and Dark, as well as Ice in Greninja's case and Flying in Tyranitar's case; Gourgeist-XL takes Fighting and Grass moves for them, in addition to Electric moves for Greninja and Ground moves for Tyranitar
    Bisharp is a good partner, as it discourages Defog which cannot be blocked by Gourgeist-XL; Gourgeist-XL takes Fighting and Ground moves aimed at Bisharp, while Bisharp covers Gourgeist-XL's Ghost, Dark, Ice and Flying weaknesses; however they are both weak to Fire
    Gourgeist-XL has lackluster Special Defense, making specially bulky Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Heatran excellent partners while also having great defensive synergy
    Sylveon and Chansey are specially bulky teammates that provides Wish and cleric support, which are both very helpful for Gourgeist-XL
    Fire type sweepers, like Talonflame, Volcarona, and Charizard can switch in on Gourgeist-XL with impunity; responses to Fire-types such as Tyranitar and Azumarill are highly recommended


Other Options
########

    Destiny Bond to net a surprise kill or discourages opponents from KOing Gourgeist-XL to net more Leech Seed recovery; too slow to be used effectively, and Protect is better for stalling
    Phantom Force is Gourgeist-XL's strongest STAB attack, but its charge turn allows opponents to respond very easily
    Fire Blast hits unsuspecting Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, but is weak otherwise
    Focus Blast, but strikes even less targets and is weaker against any relevant ones such as Heatran
    Rock Slide hits Fire-types, but Gourgeist-XL doesn't really have the moveslot to spare
    Disable, but Gourgeist-XL is too slow to make good use of it
    Explosion, but it's not strong uninvested and counter-intuitive for a spinblocker


Checks & Counters
########

    Fire-types are immune to burns and can roast it with STAB moves; Guts Conkeldurr and Flash Fire Heatran can even take advantage of Will-O-Wisp
    Grass-types are immune to Leech Seed and can outlast Gourgeist-XL if they have recovery
    Better yet, Pokemon that can halt or are immune to non-damaging attacks would be great responses: Taunt and Substitute users, as well as Magic Bounce and Magic Guard Pokemon, can all deal with Gourgeist-XL, though Alakazam and to an extent Espeon should be wary of Shadow Sneak
    Status really screws Gourgeist-XL up as it doesn't have reliable recovery, so every turn Gourgeist-XL takes damage or wastes a turn can really hurt it
    Gourgeist-XL does not have great special bulk and a lot of weaknesses, most teams should have at least one super effective special attack to heavily dent it
