Overview
########

With the introduction of two Mega Evolutions, Mewtwo can be an offensive juggernaut from both the physical and the special spectrum, making the original Uber even more dangerous and unpredictable than it already was. Boasting a movepool with expansive coverage, set up moves and numerous support options supplemented by the highest Attack or Special Attack stat in the game and a superb 130 base Speed allows Mewtwo to be almost impossible to check until its set is revealed. Moreover, Mewtwo has considerably better bulk than every other threat in the tier that can outspeed Arceus, meaning that it is no glass cannon.

However, powerful as it may be, Mewtwo also has its share of flaws. Even with its formidable offenses, Mewtwo struggles to OHKO most of the tier without super effective coverage, and its decent bulk cannot readily absorb many attacks from surviving opponents. Its typing is also mediocre, with few resistances to provide it with switch in opportunities. Nonetheless, Mewtwo is a capricious offensive colossus, cloned to create calamity and chaos.

Special 3 Attacks
########
name: Special 3 Attacks
move 1: Psystrike
move 2: Taunt / Calm Mind
move 3: Fire Blast / Focus Blast
move 4: Focus Blast / Ice Beam / Shadow Ball
ability: Pressure
item: Mewtwonite Y / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Psystrike, Mewtwo's signature move, is its most powerful STAB option and allows it to hit specially oriented walls harder. Taunt gives Mewtwo an excellent utility move, which prevents walls and support Pokemon from healing off the damage Mewtwo deals, while also preventing crippling status, phazing and support moves. However, it can opt for Calm Mind instead, allowing it to become far more potent very quickly while also becoming difficult to revenge kill with special attackers. Fire Blast

- Psystrike is good STAB and gets around special walls
- Taunt prevents status, phazing, healing, etc. Can also block Defog for offensive teams relying on SR
- Calm Mind = awesome power and very nice special bulk. Makes it hard for specially based Choice Scarf users to revenge kill Mewtwo
- Fire Blast hits Steel-types that resist Psystrike, not to mention Grass and Ice types, and is boosted in sun
- Focus Blast hits Steels, hits Heatran and Dialga best and is better vs Darkrai/Darkceus, and works in any weather
- Ice Beam hits Flying, Dragon and Ground types, pairs nicely with Fire Blast
- Shadow Ball pairs nicely with Focus Blast, hitting the Ghost and Psychic types that it doesn't
- Grass Knot can be used to hit Ground, Rock and Water types particularly hard
- Recover can be used for better longevity, but leaves you with worse coverage and finding space to Recover can be hard
- Low Kick can be used with a Hasty nature, for a more accurate but weaker alternative to Focus Blast since Mega Mewtwo Y has good uninvested Atk

Set Details
========

- EVs maximize its best stats
- If Mewtwo Y, use 60 HP / 252 SpA / 196+ Spe to outspeed base everything up to and including neutral natured Deoxys-A
- Can use Leftovers and a 252 HP spread with CM, giving more bulk to set up with as even uninvested +1 Mewtwo will be strong

Usage Tips
========

- Only try to KO mons that are weakened or that you have super effective coverage for; you don't OHKO much otherwise
- Use Taunt to shut down walls and support Pokemon, preventing them from healing the damage you deal or crippling you with status
- Switch in conservatively where possible, preferably on non-attacking moves or predicted switches; Mewtwo is not that bulky and usually lacks recovery
- Mega Mewtwo Y has good special bulk and can switch in on most special attackers pretty well, but still prefers to get in for free (especially if you lack Recover)
- Watch out for potential Scarf Pokemon and priority users

Team Options
========

- U-turn and Volt Switch to get in
- Groudon provides sun to boost Fire Blast and can tank physical attacks
- Landorus-T and Defensive Yveltal can also tank physical attacks for Mewtwo; the former can also check Blaziken and Scarf Zekrom and set SR, while the latter is an effective Ekiller Arceus check
- Stealth Rock is always nice for offensive mons, Mewtwo especially appreciates it to better take on Ho-Oh and Yveltal
- Wobbuffet can remove Scarf Pokemon, one of the main threats to Mega Mewtwo Y


Physical 3 attacks
########
name: Physical 3 attacks
move 1: Low Kick
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Zen Headbutt / Earthquake
move 4: Ice Beam / Stone Edge
ability: Pressure
item: Mewtwonite X
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Jolly

Moves
========

- Low Kick is an incredibly powerful STAB as most of the tier is quite heavy
- Taunt prevents walls from healing, inflicting status, Defogging, etc
- Zen Headbutt is STAB and just generally hits stuff that isn't hurt by Low Kick pretty well
- EQ hits Aegislash, which otherwise walls you, but is mostly redundant otherwise
- Ice Beam destroys Lando/Gliscor, and hits just about all physical walls super effectively (Lugia, Groudon, Giratina, etc)
- Stone Edge destroys Ho-Oh and generally hits Flying types nicely
- Rock Slide is more accurate but less powerful than Stone Edge, dealing 80% min to max def Ho-Oh and OHKOing most sets, but is weak against Lugia
- Poison Jab or Iron Tail hit Fairies harder than anything else, but are not great coverage otherwise

Set Details
========

- EVs again capitalize on Mewtwo's strongest stats
- Naive nature with Ice Beam, Jolly with anything else

Usage Tips
========

- Taunt walls and support Pokemon liberally so they can't heal or inflict status (beware of Aeroblast Lugia)
- Spam Low Kick to win; the damage output is ridiculous
- Again, switch in conservatively wherever possible since you lack bulk or a way to heal
- Also be wary of Scarfmon

Team Options
========

- A good check to Fairies, especially Xerneas is nice, since they switch in quite easily if you lack Poison Jab or Iron Tail; Aegislash, Scizor, Bronzong or Jirachi can fulfill these roles
- Yveltal or Darkrai are great at destroying bulky Ghost types which make the best checks to this set like Ghostceus, Giratina-O and Aegislash (unless you have EQ); just make sure you can handle Fairies
- Stealth Rock is important to beat Ho-Oh if you lack Stone Edge/Rock Slide and helps against Aeroblast Lugia; Lando-T, Dialga or Deoxys-S/A are good users
- Wobbuffet can remove Scarf Pokemon, one of the main threats to this set


Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Drain Punch / Low Kick
move 3: Zen Headbutt / Rock Slide
move 4: Taunt / Rock Slide
ability: Pressure
item: Mewtwonite X
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

- Bulk Up makes MMX hard to take down with physical attacks and makes it very strong
- Drain Punch keeps MMX alive and is a decent STAB
- Low Kick is very strong unboosted and just silly with a boost
- Zen Headbutt is secondary STAB
- Rock Slide provides great coverage alongside Drain Punch, although Aegislash still walls you
- Taunt stops phazing, status, etc
- Stone Edge can be used instead of Rock Slide for more power, although it's usually not relevant after a boost and the accuracy sucks

Set Details
========

- Needs all the speed and power it can get; EVs and nature fit accordingly

Usage Tips
========

- Scouting is crucial for the success of this set; determine the opposing Scarf Pokemon and what the opponent switches in on Mega Mewtwo X
- Come in on things that are forced out by the threat you present and set up
- Use Drain Punch liberally unless you expect a Ghost to switch in so you can heal
- Once your set is revealed time your set ups carefully; if a Scarf Pokemon gets in for free you're forced out
- Again use Taunt liberally against walls and support Pokemon so you're not phazed (beware of Aeroblast Lugia though)

Team Options
========

- Checks to Fairies are important again
- Yveltal is once again great at destroying many of your checks, Darkrai works too
- Stealth Rock is important to OHKO Ho-Oh unless you have Rock Slide/Stone Edge and helps against Aeroblast Lugia
- Wobbuffet because Scarfmon are always tedious


Stalltwo
########
name: Stalltwo
move 1: Psystrike
move 2: Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Recover
move 4: Taunt
ability: Unnerve
item: Leftovers / Mewtwonite Y
evs: 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

- Psystrike is STAB so it can deal some damage outside of burns
- Will-o-Wisp cripples physical attackers and does nice residual damage
- Recover heals Mewtwo so it can keep crippling stuff and walling weaker attackers
- Taunt prevents walls healing and mons crippling Mewtwo with status

Set Details
========

- Enough speed to outspeed Arceus, rest in physical bulk to handle physical attackers better before a burn (you lose against Darkrai anyway and Skymin is rare)
- If Mewtwo Y, use 252 HP / 80 SpD / 176+ Spe, allowing it to outspeed base 130s, with the rest in special bulk as its physical bulk is hopeless
- Opting for Mewtwo Y means considerably better special bulk that can take on things like Palkia and Dialga, but without Leftovers and with lower physical bulk you're vulnerable to physical attackers until you burn them

Usage Tips
========

- Use Taunt liberally to prevent healing, status, support moves, etc, you have the bulk to take attacking moves from essentially all defensive Pokemon that lack super effective STAB
- Spread burns against physical attackers, but try to avoid burning things you'd rather Toxic
- With bulk investment and recover you can now switch in a lot less conservatively; the likes of support Arceus can't hurt you and a Will-o-Wisp quickly shuts down physical attackers that lack super effective moves
- The bulk is good, but not incredible; don't switch into very strong attackers, not even physical ones you can burn
- Be particularly wary of status; no Mewtwo appreciates it, but Toxic will ruin this set
- Try to predict Ho-Oh switch ins, you don't want to let it in for free on Will-o-Wisp


Team Options
========

- Rock Arceus counters Ho-Oh and Yveltal, some of the best checks to this set
- Lando-T or Water Arceus also work for Ho-Oh
- Fairies for checking Yveltal and Darkrai
- Stealth Rock is great since Ho-Oh and Yveltal come in for free on a lot of this set's moves; this set also excels at preventing Defog so you can maintain it well enough
- Doesn't need much support since you're the support mon


Other Options
########

- Thunder is kinda strong, but Grass Knot/Ice beam hit its targets and the accuracy sucks out of rain
- Hurricane is strong but lacks targets between Psystrike and Fireblast, also horrible accuracy out of rain
- Dual Screens would be cool but your team needs to be able to prevent Defog
- Substitute eases prediction and does a lot of stuff Taunt does but the HP is precious, as is the moveslot
- Fire Punch can be used on MMX if you hate Scizor
- Ice Punch can be used instead of Ice Beam on MMX
- Shadow Claw can be used on MMX if you really hate Ghost types, but is mostly redundant between its other options

Checks & Counters
########
Due to having two Mega Evolutions, Mewtwo is virtually impossible to check until its Mega Evolution is revealed.

**Ghost Arceus**: The only Pokemon with reliable recovery that can switch into almost any Mewtwo set without fear of being 2HKOed and also threaten Mewtwo

**Giratina-O**: Giratina-O can quite comfortably tank all but the super effective moves and threaten Mewtwo formes with its STABs, but can be worn down and beaten

**Aegislash**: Has great resistances and immunities to switch in on, but also fears Ghost, Fire and Ground-type moves. Can threaten Mewtwo formes with Shadow Ball/Sneak

**Wobbuffet**: Beats the offensive sets with Counter or Mirror Coat unless it switches into Shadow Ball, although Stalltwo shuts it down with Taunt and Will-o-Wisp.

**Yveltal**: Can switch into any attack from Mega Mewtwo Y or regular Mewtwo and threaten to OHKO with Sucker Punch. It can also survive any attack from Mega Mewtwo X and threaten to OHKO with Oblivion Wing, but can't switch in.

**Psychic Arceus**: Absorbs any attacks except for Shadow Ball/Claw with ease and threatens Mewtwo with Punishment or Judgment.

**Dark Arceus**: Can check Mega Mewtwo Y assuming it does not switch into a Fighting move.

**Bulky Fairies**: Fairy Arceus and defensive Xerneas can comfortably tank any Mega Mewtwo X lacking Iron Tail or Poison Jab and threaten it with their STAB moves.

**Lugia**: Tanks most moves from Mega Mewtwo X with impunity and 2HKOs with Aeroblast.

**Ho-Oh**: Can easily survive any attack except for Rock Slide or Stone Edge in the absence of Stealth Rock, and threatens any set immensely with its STAB moves.

**Blanket walls**: Lugia, Giratina and Ho-Oh are all good initial switch ins while the set/Mega Evolution is unknown, as they will survive any attack (except for Rock Slide or Stone Edge in the case of Ho-Oh) easily, even if they all lose to certain Mewtwo sets

**Revenge Killers**: Many Scarf Pokemon such has Kyogre, Zekrom, Xerneas and Yveltal can outspeed and OHKO most or all of these sets, although special attackers and physical attackers will struggle with Calm Mind and Bulk Up sets respectively. Mega Mewtwo Y is also very vulnerable to priority due to its low Defense and Sucker Punch weakness, while Mega Mewtwo X can be picked off by priority when weakened.
