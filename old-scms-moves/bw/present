[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Either deals damage or heals the target. The move has a 40% chance to be a 40 Base Power attack, a 30% chance to be an 80 Base Power attack, a 10% chance to be a 120 Base Power attack, and a 20% chance to heal the target by 1/4 its maximum HP. This move must hit to be effective. This move will consume a Normal Gem even if the opponent is healed.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Arguably the most hilarious move introduced in GSC. Hilarity doesn't win battles, though. This move is too unpredictable, and 120 base power isn't so great when it happens only 10% of the time. On average, Present has 52 base power, and that's without factoring in accuracy or the 25% HP healing that it could do. Every Pokemon other than Togekiss also has to have Delibird as a father to get it...</p>
