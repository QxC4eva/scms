<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sharpen is a horrible move. It has incredibly limited distribution, being only known by Porygon, who shouldn't ever bother with a physical attacking set, as it has a low Attack stat and it's basically a bad Pokemon that's not used even in NU.</p>
