<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Orange League pits teams of users against each other to show off their best in-game scores, fastest speedruns, and mini-game skills. Every two weeks, a new round begins and the leaderboards are updated. Players have 4 days to track down teammates that have the games they lack. After teams are formed, users have 10 days to achieve the highest scores they can and submit them to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=139618">TheOrangeLeague</a>. More details can be found <a href="/orangeleague/rules">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Leaderboards</h2>

<p>Leaderboards will be kept for users that have earned the most points in The Orange League, which can be found below. Furthermore, a history of prior wins can be found in our <a href="/orangeleague/archive">archives</a>, which detail every challenge, winning teams, and past results.</p>
