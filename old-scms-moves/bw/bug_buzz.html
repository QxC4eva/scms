<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Bug Buzz is the premier special Bug-type move in the game; otherwise, only Signal Beam is seen, and this is only ever seen on Pokemon who do not learn Bug Buzz. Though its Base Power is not exceptional, the move is powerful enough with STAB to allow special attackers such as Yanmega and Volcarona to wreak havoc. Notably, Yanmega and Venomoth can use the move alongside Tinted Lens, giving the move excellent coverage on its own. Altogether, though most of the Pokemon which learn Bug Buzz are weak, every single one gets STAB on the move, and as such Bug Buzz will be frequently seen on any with a passable Special Attack stat.</p>
