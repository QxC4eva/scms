[SHORT DESC]
Lowers the PP of the move used last by 4.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Lowers the PP of the last move used by the target by 4. Fails if the target has not used a move since it has switched in, if the target tried and failed to use a move this turn (due to sleep, paralysis, recharging, etc) before being targeted with Spite, or if the target's last used move already has 0 PP remaining.
