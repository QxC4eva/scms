
Overview
########
- Huge Power makes Diggersby hit insanely hard&mdash;its +2 Return 2HKOes Skarmory.
- Priority Quick Attack is strong and makes up for its low Speed.
- SD is extremely hard to stop in general for offensive and defensive teams alike.
- It's kind of slow, so faster Pokemon that can take a +2 Quick Attack are all set against it.
- STABs have some glaring coverage holes.
- Common weaknesses limit its setup opportunities.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Return
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Quick Attack
ability: Huge Power
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Swords Dance boosts Diggersby's Attack to insane levels.
- Return and Earthquake have good coverage as STABs, able to deal with most foes.
- Quick Attack lets Diggersby knock out many faster foes at +2 that would otherwise destroy it.

Set Details
========
- Max Speed spread lets it outrun Modest Heatran and everything slower, as well as things like defensive Landorus-T.
- Life Orb is far preferred for the insane power it provides.
- Silk Scarf can be used if you don't want the recoil.

Usage Tips
========
- You can just punch holes early-game; don't try to set up too early, before Diggersby can actually sweep.
- Take advantage of Quick Attack to revenge kill weakened foes, such as Thundurus.
- This can be used as a supplement to another sweeper or as the main sweeper of a team itself; it all depends on the battle and how your team is structured.

Team Options
========
- This thing loves hazards because it forces so many switches. It fits particularly well onto Deoxys-D/Deoxys-S hazard-stacking HO teams.
- Thundurus, Kyurem-B, Mega Charizard X, Mega Pinsir, etc. can put pressure on Skarmory, which can stop a sweep short with Whirlwind, and fit well onto the HO teams Diggersby is built for.

Other Options
########
- Choice Scarf makes a nice revenge killer and U-turn spammer to gain momentum throughout the match, as well as cleaner late-game.

Checks and Counters
########

**Ghost-types immune to Earthquake**: Gengar and Air Balloon Aegislash, particularly, are hard stops to Diggersby.

**Faster Pokemon that can take a +2 Quick Attack**: Keldeo, Terrakion, and others that can take a boosted Quick Attack can by proxy check Diggersby relatively well.
