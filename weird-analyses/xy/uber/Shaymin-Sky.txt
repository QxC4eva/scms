Overview
########

Shaymin-S is one of the great pioneers of the "60% = 100%" bias, and it returns to Ubers again to prove itself once again. With the combination of Seed Flare + Air Slash, Shaymin-S can break through special walls with Special Defense drops or flinch something to its inevitable death. Coupled with one of the best Speed tiers in Ubers, only Mewtwo, its Mega Evolutions, Mega Gengar, and Deoxys-A / S can catch up to it. Though its Special Attack may seem decent, Seed Flare's effects can patch that up quite nicely, and an immunity to Sticky Web only furthers Shaymin-S's usefulness on a team. Unfortunately, Shaymin-S's subpar defensive typing and frailty hold it back from coming in whenever it wants, and a weakness to Stealth Rock furthers this, even with the addition of Defoggers. Also, Shaymin-S has somewhat sparse coverage options, and the fact that its STABs don't cover much doesn't help either. Regardless, Shaymin-S can still do what it does best: show that Serene Grace is never to be trifled with, especially in the hands of a legendary Pokemon.

SubSeed
########
name: SubSeed
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Seed Flare
move 4: Air Slash
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

With Substitute, Shaymin-S can take advantage of the switches it forces against bulky Water-types or Ground-types and shield it from damage or status. Leech Seed increases Shaymin-S's survivability even further, and can replenish its health against walls or tanks. Seed Flare is Shaymin-S's signature move, which helps it bypass special walls, and nothing likes having an 80% chance to have its Special Defense dropped while having their health leeched away. Air Slash covers Shaymin-S's STAB combination, and can flinch something to death when needed, and can be a reliable move to spam other than Seed Flare when you have Leech Seed or a Substitute up.

Set Details
=========

The above EV spread allows Shaymin-S to set up Substitutes fast with its great Speed and sit back and Seed Flare away. Also, due to Shaymin-S's slight reliance on Seed Flare to do damage, using max Special Attack investment is highly recommended. But, a Modest nature can be implemented in the above set to have a bit more power behind your attacks, but losing the ability to outspeed Darkrai and max Speed Arceus is something you have to take into consideration.

Usage Tips
=========

One of the rules of thumb for Substitute is to stay on top of predicted switches so that you can find opportunities to set up, which still applies to Shaymin-S. This is important as Shaymin-S can force out threats like Groudon, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and even the mighty Kyogre, and set up a Substitute for free. Also, try using Substitute to scout out super effective coverage moves, and try to use it before Leech Seed, as you can get it up safely without being damaged. But, when using the two, try using Substitute if you feel if an offensive threat is coming in so you can scout out their set, or Leech Seed if you think a defensive Pokemon or phazer is coming in so you can get residual damage against them. In lines of attacking, Shaymin-S's STAB combos may not have too good coverage, but they are very threatening or spammable, so fire away when needed. In terms of priority attacks, Steel-types or possible phazers, try to avoid them as best you can unless you have a Substitute up (for Steel-types and priority), or can flee with Leech Seed up (phazers).

Team Options
=========

Though a rage-inducing soloist most of the time, Shaymin-S has many allies. The primary ones are VoltTurn users, who can gain momentum and bring Shaymin-S in on a fleeing opponent. Groudon is a very solid partner for Shaymin-S, as it can set up Stealth Rock and can check Ho-Oh in addition to Skarmory and Scizor. Though Mega Gengar helps many, it can also trap Steel-types and cripple them with Taunt, leaving them open to Shaymin-S's shenanigans. Yveltal is also a solid friend, as it pretty much borks most of the Steel-types in Ubers, and can assist Shaymin-S with Taunt or U-turn. Heatran is a very helpful partner as it can lure Ground-types for Shaymin-S to switch in on a predicted Ground-type move and proceed to set up, and Heatran can also set up Stealth Rocks. Hazard setters like Forretress, Ferrothorn, Dialga, and Landorus-T are also crucial to Shaymin-S's success as Stealth Rock and / or Spikes can let it finish off or defeat support Arceus and Ho-Oh. Hazard removal is equally important, as Shaymin-S wants to switch in as much as it can, so Defog users like Arceus and Giratina or Rapid Spinners like Excadrill and Forretress can help out in this regard, and the latter 3 do enjoy Leech Seed to increase recovery and longevity.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Seed Flare
move 2: Air Slash
move 3: Earth Power / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Healing Wish / Hidden Power Fire
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

When equipped with Life Orb, Shaymin-S can be a dangerous attacker capable of fending for itself when needed. Seed Flare does good damage with Life Orb, and of course, nothing likes switching into it in fear of a Special Defense drop. Earth Power is actually Shaymin-S's main resource for defeating Steel-types which wall its STAB combination, and can also cause a 20% chance to lower the opponent's Special Defense as well. Instead of Earth Power, Hidden Power Fire can let Shaymin-S defeat the Steel-types that don't care too much about Earth Power like Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Scizor. But, Healing Wish is actually a support move that Shaymin-S can claim its own outside of Latias, and if Shaymin-S is either not useful or cannot deal enough damage due to attacks or Life Orb recoil, it can simply sacrifice itself to restore a damaged sweeper, pivot, or revenge killer to full health. Though not listed here, Hidden Power Rock allows Shaymin-S to take on or kill Ho-Oh, and can damage other Flying-types outside of Ho-Oh reliably due to the Life Orb boost.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature lets Shaymin-S outspeed most of the unboosted tier easily, and with Life Orb, the damage is very acceptable, even more so than a unboosted Modest nature. However, if you do want that extra 10% in terms of damage, a Modest nature can certainly fit the bill, but once again keep in mind that you cannot outspeed max Speed Arceus formes or Darkrai anymore. In terms of EVs, Shaymin-S should not deviate from the above spread, as its Speed and power are all too precious to give up instead of its below-average bulk.

Usage Tips
========

When attempting to select moves when attacking, don't be too afraid to mispredict with your STABs, as they are extremely spammable, and they are backed up with Life Orb, so don't be too afraid to click Seed Flare unless a Steel-type that checks you is on the opposing team. But, be very wary of the recoil that you get from Life Orb, as your health could reduce to the point where a priority user like Yveltal, Scizor, or Extreme Killer Arceus can come in and revenge kill you with ease. Therefore, you should try to avoid priority users as much as possible, as Shaymin-S's frailty combined with Life Orb recoil can turn it into a high-priority target.

Team Options
========

As always for any offensive threat, hazards on the opponent's side of the field can take advantage of Shaymin-S's offensive pressure and rack up residual damage. Setters of Stealth Rock like Landorus-T, Dialga, and Groudon in addition to Spikes setters like Forretress or Ferrothorn will obviously help greatly in this regard. Also, hazard removal methods are important, so Defoggers like Arceus and Giratina, and Spinners like Forretress and Excadrill can remove these without a fuss. Even with Earth Power or Hidden Power Fire, Shaymin-S should have extra support against Steel-types. So, Fire-types like Ho-Oh or stallbreakers like Yveltal or even Darkrai can assist Shaymin-S in this case. VoltTurn is still a safe method to bring Shaymin-S in, and Thundurus-I and Genesect can provide momentum to do so and supply their team members with extra utility. Also, lures for Ground-types can also bring Shaymin-S in safely, which Heatran can perform extremely easily with its 4x Ground weakness.

Other Options
########

Shaymin-S does have a relatively solid set of options to choose from when thinking outside the box. A Choice Specs or Choice Scarf set is one that comes to mind quickly, as the former can provide immense wallbreaking power with Seed Flare, while the latter's increased Speed can revenge kill even boosted threats like Rock Polish Groudon. However, neither of them like being locked into a move, and the Scarf set isn't as powerful as Life Orb in terms of an all-out attacker. Though, Shaymin-S does have a boosting move in Swords Dance, which can do well with its great Speed. But, Shaymin-S's movepool is more barren than a Ditto's expression, with the movepool options being only Seed Bomb and Return. In terms of filler options, Shaymin-S has a rare access to Aromatherapy, which can let it function as more of an offensive cleric that can take on opposing walls with Seed Flare. Also, Shaymin-S has Dazzling Gleam, which can deal solid damage to Dark- and Dragon-types, but Seed Flare hits those types with almost the same damage on neutral hits. Shaymin-S also has a good filler of Grass-type moves to use. Leaf Storm can provide immediate power at the cost of a power drop, Energy Ball has more PP than Seed Flare, and Giga Drain can restore health. But, the sheer utility and usefulness Seed Flare has to offer overshadows these greatly. Finally, Shaymin-S can utilize Toxic to cripple walls or Defoggers, and can run it in tandem with SubSeed. But, Shaymin-S has a relatively cramped movepool, and Toxic can simply be run on a bulkier team member.

Checks and Counters
#########
**Ho-Oh**: Ho-Oh provides a large threat to Shaymin-S as its massive special bulk, 4x resist to Seed Flare, and the threat of KOing Shaymin-S with Sacred Fire or Brave Bird. But, if Stealth Rock is up and / or Shaymin-S has Hidden Power Rock, Ho-Oh should go down without too much of a hassle.

**Mega Gengar**: Mega Gengar can easily check Shaymin-S as it resists Seed Flare, can trap or cripple it with Taunt, and even can outspeed and KO Shaymin-S without trouble. However, Shaymin-S can hit it with Earth Power as it Mega Evolves for a KO due to Mega Gengar's frailty.

**Levitating Steels**: Skarmory and Bronzong cause a great deal of trouble for Shaymin-S, as it has to resort to using Hidden Power Fire in order to defeat them. Though Shaymin-S can do almost nothing to Bronzong, it can hit Skarmory with Hidden Power Fire for good damage.

**Scizor**: If Shaymin-S does not carry Hidden Power Fire, Scizor can switch in on a Seed Flare and pick it off with a Technician-boosted Bullet Punch.

**Dialga**: Dialga usually carries investment in Special Defense, and can take all of Shaymin-S's attacks and can deal severe damage with Draco Meteor. But, with Earth Power, Shaymin-S can take on Dialga reliably.

**Mega Charizard X / Y**: As both 4x resist Seed Flare, both Mega Charizard X and Y can switch in and threaten to KO with Fire attacks. But, both can be flinched to death, Mega Charizard X falls to Earth Power, and Mega Charizard Y does not like Hidden Power Rock.

**Heatran**: Heatran can hard-wall Shaymin-S due to its typing and Flash Fire, and can kill with Lava Plume. But, it doesn't stand a chance if Shaymin-S has Earth Power.

**Kyurem-W**: Kyurem-W gives no quarter to Shaymin-S as it cannot switch into its devastating attacks and does not take too much damage from Shaymin-S's coverage options.

**Sylveon**: Sylveon's great special bulk and the ability to attack through Substitute with Hyper Voice can annoy Shaymin-S if not weakened first.

**Blissey**: As a pink blob, Blissey can take any hit the All-out Attacker set can throw at it. However, it is total and complete set up fodder for the SubSeed set, and loans incomprehensible amounts of HP through Leech Seed.

**Lugia**: Shaymin-S cannot hit Lugia hard enough without Hidden Power Rock or Stealth Rock up, and Lugia can either heal up with Roost or can threaten with Aeroblast.

**Revenge Killers**: Probably the biggest thorn in Shaymin-S's side, revenge killers are the best tactic to deal with it. Choice Scarf users like Zekrom or Genesect, or priority users like Yveltal and Extreme Killer Arceus can take advantage of Shaymin-S's poor bulk and kill it easily.

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock prevents Shaymin-S from switching in freely without losing 25% of its health, and can rack up residual damage over the course of the match.

**Status**: Paralysis cripples Shaymin-S thoroughly and utterly, preventing it from using its great Speed stat, leaving it open to attack. Shaymin-S does not like residual damage from Toxic or burns also, as it could wear it down to the point where it could be revenge killed.

However, keep in mind that all of these checks or counters cannot take on Shaymin-S like any other special attacker, as Seed Flare can and will wear opponent's defenses down to where a simple coverage move can either cripple or KO.
