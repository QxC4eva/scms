<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to lower the target's Speed by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There is not much competitive value in this move. At all. It's outclassed by virtually every other Normal-type move in the game, thanks to its horrible Base Power, and its only side effect has a very low chance of happening.</p>

<h2>Related Moves</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/moves/return">Return</a> has a higher Base Power and perfect accuracy, making it a much more reliable option.</p>
<p><a href="/bw/moves/double-edge">Double-Edge</a> is a much more powerful alternative; however, it inflicts recoil damage upon the user.</p>
