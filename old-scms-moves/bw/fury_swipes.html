[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. It has a 1/3 chance for the move to hit either 2 or 3 times, and a 1/6 chance to hit either 4 or 5 times. If a Focus Sash or the ability Sturdy is activated through one of the hits, another hit will KO the target. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate for every hit taken, and every hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock, Razor Fang, or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. Color Change will only activate on the last hit of the move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat all the hits as a single attack. If this move breaks a Substitute, the attack can still continue and hurt the target. If the target holds a Chilan or Jaboca Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. If the user has the ability Skill Link, this move will always hit five times.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Fury Swipes should not be used competitively. Its variable Base Power and imperfect accuracy make it too unreliable, especially when strong and more reliable alternatives such as Return and Double-Edge exist.</p>
