<h2>Issue 1</h2>

<p style="margin-right:5px">Welcome to the very first issue of The Player! In the past few months, we've come a long way from the webzine's inception to now. This issue features 10 articles (including this piece) as well as some fantastic cover art by <a href="/forums/members/blue-frog.163333/">Blue Frog</a>, who also created the webzine's logo.
