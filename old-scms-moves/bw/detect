[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prevents any move that targets the user from taking effect for the turn it is used in. Does not prevent passive damage such as sandstorm or poison. This attack has a 1/X chance of being successful, where X starts at 1 and doubles each time this move is successfully used. X resets to 1 if this attack fails or if the user's last used move is not Detect, Endure, Protect, Quick Guard, or Wide Guard. If X is 256 or more, this move has a 1/(2^32) chance of being successful. Fails if the user moves last this turn. This move has a priority of +4.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Detect is a stalling and more defensively inclined move. Like Protect, it should be used on defensive Pokemon, as a scouting move or for a free turn to gather Leftovers recovery. You will never see it in standard singles play, as it is totally outclassed by Protect, which has a superior distribution (every Pokemon that learns Detect also learns Protect) and much higher PP. However, in doubles play, Detect is far less likely to be affected by Imprison due to its lesser distribution, and is often used instead of Protect if the Pokemon has access to it.</p>
