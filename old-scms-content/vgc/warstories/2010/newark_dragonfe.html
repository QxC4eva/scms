<p>So uh, it starts with me taking a quick shower at around 6 am in the morning. I wake up my sister and she is still like half asleep and so i make breakfast get dressed all that shit. I call TDS and say that I'm gonna meet him at Port authority bus terminal at around 9. As we head over there i get a few more calls from him and a text from Fightgar saying the line is already piling up...<strong>*cries*</strong>.</p> 


<p>So, as we head over to the place we end up looking for Fightgar and in a moment appears out of nowhere lol and get my falcon shirt (WOO!). We chill and talk for a bit and decide to go inside since fightgar's mom is inside(WOO! VIP BITCHES!.. jk lol). At this point, i get out my team sheet(which is already filled out) and start for registration.</p>

<p>ONTO THE MATCHES!</p>

<h2>Round 1</h2>
<p>I barely remember this at all. The only thing i remember is winning 3-0?</p>

<p>So i pick up my crap and advance into the next zone.</p>

<h2>Round 2:</h2>
<p>I think he led with a groudon and a typlosion? i honestly don't know but this ended with a 2-0. He was a good sport about it.</p>


<p>And this... is where my adventure ends for me and get paired with the person who makes top 4 (aka Chalkey).</p>

<h2>Round 3:</h2>
<p>Sadly i don't have a vid saved since this was a really close match. The only thing i remember is him leading with the same weather(Rain) except he had a Croak in place of Ludi i believe? All i remember is this ending down to the wire with My Gira and his Ogre both in the near red zone. He surfed in the end which finally finished me off and this is where i lost my stylus lol x.x.</p>


<p>In all i had a really awesome time especially meeting you Skarmbliss peeps!. The only downfall to this was spending about 40 bucks at a burger place outside the Building.</p>

<p>Here is a group pic we had in the end:</p>
