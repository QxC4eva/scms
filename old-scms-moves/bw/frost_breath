<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 100% chance to land a critical hit. Pokemon under the effect of Lucky Chant or with the abilities Battle Armor or Shell Armor cannot be critical hit but will take damage as normal.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While slightly weaker and less accurate than Ice Beam, Frost Breath is an acceptable alternative. It is useful for countering defensive stat boosters, as the critical hits ignore the boosts. However, defensive stat boosters are few and far between in the current metagame, lowering the need for Frost Breath.</p>
