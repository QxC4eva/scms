[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Has a 10% chance to freeze target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The most powerful Ice-type move, reliable in RBY and overall very deadly. You should only choose Ice Beam over this if you are worried about using all its PP, which may happen in the case of Mewtwo versus Mewtwo. Jynx hits very hard with its STAB Blizzard, and the freeze chance comes in handy. It's an excellent coverage move that most Tauros should use since it deals with Exeggutor, Zapdos, Rhydon, and Golem. Its only downside is its low PP; other than that it's an excellent move to have.</p>
