<h2>Guides</h2>

<p><strong><a href="/bw/articles/nuspeed_tiers">NU Speed Tiers</a></strong> - With so many viable Pokemon in the tier, it's hard to remember what Speed number whatever Pokemon has. Fear no longer, because this guide will help.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/bw/articles/bw_nu_sun">Using Sun in NU</a></strong> - Sun is an interesting brand of offense in NU. It needs quite a bit of support to be effective, and there are a few other factors that you have to keep in mind when building and using a sun team, which this article will talk about.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3470041">NU Teambuilding</a></strong> - Not sure what to use with all of the options? This thread will tell you what's good and what's... not so good.

<p><strong><a href="/bw/articles/nu_threats">NU Threat List</a></strong> - This article is an amazing resource if you're new to the tier. It has a short overview about each Pokemon that explains why they are threats and what to watch out for from them.</p>

<h2>Helpful Articles from The Smog</h2>

<p><strong><a href="/smog/issue23/nu_baton_pass">NU Baton Pass</a></strong> - While old, this article explains the best users of baton pass in the tier. Keep in mind some of the Pokemon referred to in the article are no longer in the tier, but other than that it's a good guide.</p>
