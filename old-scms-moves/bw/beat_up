<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The user attacks the target 1 to 6 times (once for every non-fainted and non-statused (including sleep, poison, freeze, burn, and paralysis) Pokemon on the user's team). The names of the Pokemon are not given. The Base Power of each hit is determined as follows:

<p>Base Power = (base Attack stat of participating Pokemon)/10 + 5</p>

<p>The actual damage calculation uses the Beat Up user's actual Attack stat and the target's actual Defense stat. Each individual hit counts as a separate attack with a separate chance for a critical hit. Beat Up deals Dark-type damage and all hits will receive STAB if the user of the attack is Dark-type, regardless of the other team members' types. If the initial user of Beat Up is not a Dark-type, no Dark-type teammates will receive STAB on their attack. All Beat Up hits are boosted if the user of the move has an Attack-raising item such as Choice Band, but the attack ignores all stat changes from moves such as Swords Dance. Beat Up will trigger certain abilities, such as Weak Armor and Justified, multiple times. It will not trigger Rocky Helmet or other recoil abilities on the party Pokemon. Life Orb will only make the user of Beat Up lose 10% of its health once. In a double or triple battle, if a Pokemon uses Beat Up on one of its teammates, then that teammate will attack itself.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Although Beat Up is a horrible move choice in the standard metagame, Beat Up has a very distinct niche in the VGC 2011 metagame. Beat Up forms the basis of the "TerraCott" combo: a Whimsicott attacks its Terrakion partner with Beat Up, raising Terrakion's Attack four stages via Justified (assuming no team members have fainted), while Terrakion decimates the opponent with its STAB Rock Slide. The strategy is effective, but it's usually well prepared for by experienced VGC Players. Still, Beat Up's ability to indirectly wipe out two opponents on the first turn of a double battle is fantastic.</p>
