<p>Tutoring Tournaments are going to be run concurrently with each and every round as a new addition to the Smogon Apprentice Program! These are meant to provide an opportunity for program participants to show off just how much they are learning from their mentors as well as build camaraderie between players. Apprentices are encouraged to take advantage of their tutor's team building and battling expertise throughout the tournament!</p>

<p>Due to time constraints, only the first 16 people who indicate interest in the Apprentice Program sign-up thread will be allowed to participate. Entire tutoring rounds last for only three weeks at a time, so do not be discouraged if you miss out. You can always try again the following round!</p>

<p>Please familiarize yourself with the rules below that are specific to Tutoring Tournaments:</p>

<ol class="long_list">
<li>Battles will be 6 on 6 B/W played on the Smogon Server of the Pokemon Online simulator.</li>
<li>Tournament rounds will last a maximum of 1 week. No extensions will be granted. It is up to the discretion of the tournament administrator to determine who will advance in the event of an incomplete match.</li>
<li>Pokemon that are considered "Uber" are banned from use on all teams. Smogon's tier list is supreme. Smogon's ban list can be found <a href="/forums/announcement.php?f=144&a=187">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following clauses must be enabled for all Tutoring Tournament matches.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Timed Battle:</strong> Select this clause when challenging for all Smogon Tour matches. This is necessary in the interest of finishing the tournament in a speedy manner.</p>
<p><strong>Species Clause:</strong> A player cannot have two of the same Pokémon on their team.  For example, a player cannot have two Koffings on his or her team.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep Clause:</strong> A player cannot put two or more different opposing Pokémon to sleep using attacks that induce sleep to opposing Pokémon.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion Clause:</strong> A player cannot increase their Pokémon's evasion stat with a move that specifically increases evasion. Items or indirect boosts do not break this clause.</p>
<p><strong>OHKO Clause:</strong> Players cannot use moves that have a chance of instantly KO opposing Pokémon. For example, Horn Drill is an illegal move to have on a Pokémon's moveset.</p>
<p><strong>No Extended Game:</strong> No player may use the Pokémon Arceus, or the Micle, Custap, Jaboca, and Rowap Berries in any tier.</p></blockquote>
