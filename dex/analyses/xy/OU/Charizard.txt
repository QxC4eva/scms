Moves
========

- Dragon Dance turns him into a terrifying sweeper after one Dragon Dance.

- Dragon Claw is your secondary STAB moves to hit anything that isn't a Steel or Fairy type without locking yourself into Outrage.
- Outrage is much more powerful option than Dragon Claw, however locking yourself into Outrage with Steel or Fairy types around you leave yourself open to being set up on.
