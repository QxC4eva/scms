Policy Committee
[page]
<p>The Policy Committee is a group of experienced project members whose primary responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating Policy Review topics</li>
<li>Discussing Policy Review topics</li>
<li>Voting in Policy Review polls</li>
</ul>

<p>A Policy Committee is formed over the course of every CAP project - signups for the current Project's Policy Committee begin at the commencement of the project, and last until its closure. Once a member is accepted onto the Committee, they will retain membership until the opening of the next Policy Committee thread. A Policy Committee nomination thread is opened around the same time as the Topic Leader Nomination thread. The same general rules apply. You need to be experienced, you can only nominate yourself, and you make a brief pitch for why you should be on the panel.</p>

<p>The forum moderation staff will select the committee, based on members' involvement in the forum. There is no limit to the size of the committee. The goal is to be very inclusive; anyone who is regularly active in the forum, that makes reasonably intelligent posts (and who wants to serve on the committee, of course) will normally be selected.</p>

<p>After a member posts their pitch for why they should be a part of the committee, their candidacy will be debated by the forum moderation staff, and if approved, they will be added to the original post of the nomination thread and given posting access in the CAP Policy Review subforum. If unsuccessful, they will receive a Private Message from the Project Leader for that CAP explaining the reasoning behind the decision.</p>

<p>When holding Policy Committee votes, the appropriate thread in the CAP Policy Review subforum will be updated with a summary of the motion being voted on and the option of a "Yes" or "No" vote. The title of the discussion thread in question will be changed to reflect the presence of a vote, as well as the duration. Only current approved committee members are able to post in the voting threads.</p>

<p>The CAP Project Leader serves as the non-voting chairperson of the Topic Leader Selection Panel. The chairperson organizes the nomination threads, coordinates voting, and only votes in the case of a tie.</p>

<h2>Policy Committee Eligibility Requirements</h2>

<p>Members of the Policy Committee must have been actively involved through the entire duration of the most recent CAP project. Involvement in multiple CAP projects is preferred, but, remember that even if someone was involved in past CAP projects, if they were not around for the most recent project, then they really are not current on the state of the CAP project and/or server as it is.</p>

<p>It is essential that members of the Policy Committee are up-to-date. That's the reason we form a new committee before each CAP project. There will be no honorary committee members or members selected simply because they are popular and generally respected.</p>

<p>"Actively involved" means that you have posted regularly with intelligent contributions to the discussions. Lurking is not "active involvement". Voting is not "active involvement".</p>

<p>Posting popular opinions is not a requirement. Posting intelligent opinions is a requirement. It's perfectly acceptable if someone that is not well-liked is selected to be on the Policy Committee. This is not a popularity contest. It is recognition of a certain level of activity and knowledge about the CAP project.</p>

<p>Rule-breaking is not only unpopular, it's an example of a <em>lack</em> of knowledge about the CAP project. If you've been infracted heavily in the CAP forum in the past, do not expect to be selected to the Policy Committee, regardless of your activity level.</p>
