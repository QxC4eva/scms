<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises the power of Psychic-type moves 20% when this item is held.</p>

<p>If Mr. Mime holds Odd Incense while breeding, a Mime Jr. egg is created.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Odd Incense generally does not see much competitive play. This is partly due to the fact that few Pokemon are able to effectively use multiple attacks of the same type. Therefore, most trainers will opt to use items that provide bigger boosts to a wider range of attacks, such as <a href="/dp/items/choice_band">Choice Band</a>, which boosts the power of physical attacks, <a href="/dp/items/choice_specs">Choice Specs</a>, which boosts the power of special attacks, or <a href="/dp/items/life_orb">Life Orb</a>, which boosts the power of both kinds of attacks. Odd Incense does not have side effects, which all three alternative items carry with them.</p>
