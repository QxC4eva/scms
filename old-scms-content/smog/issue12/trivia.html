<p><em>This is a fun section of The Smog where readers like you&mdash;yes, you&mdash;can help shape future issues of the ezine and also get some cool prizes. To send in your answers, please send a private message to the Smogon user <a href="/forums/private.php?do=newpm&amp;u=32443">The Smog</a> entitled "Issue 12 Polls/Trivia" with answers to any or all questions.</em></p>

<p>Hello and good day, Smogonites! I hope you're all enjoying the new wave of Gen V! Well, this issue (or should I say, <em>Isshu</em>, geddit?), I've come up with some Gen V related brain-scratchers&mdash;great for testing your knowledge on the games so far. These aren't as mind-numbing as previous ones, however. After all, I need to give out some easy questions sometimes, right?</p>

<p>But first, we go onto the business of last issue's winner. <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/member.php?u=46220">Athenodoros</a> scraped victory against two other tie-breaker competitors, but only got it in the end because he listed more options for Question 2 and was dutiful enough to mention Arceus. Please PM Mekkah for your prize&mdash;your choice of a custom title! Well, let's just look at the answers now, shall we?</p>

<h2>Trivia Answers</h2>

<dl>
<dt>1. What were the first Pokémon from the second, third, and fourth generation that were shown in America?</dt>
<dd><strong>Gen 2: Ho-oh / Gen 3: Azurill, Kecleon, Wailmer / Gen 4: Munchlax</strong>. In the case of Gen III, they were all revealed at the same time.</dd>

<dt>2. Which Pokémon become slower when they evolve?</dt>
<dd><strong>Caterpie, Weedle, Poliwhirl, Magneton, Onix, Tangela, Scyther, Electabuzz, Magmar, Murkrow, Remoraid, Wurmple, Wingull, Surskit, Anorith, Combee</strong>. Some missed a few, some got all of them.</dd>

<dt>3. Which is the most common type combination in dual-typed Pokémon? (The order of the types is irrelevant.)</dt>
<dd><strong>Normal/Flying</strong>.</dd>

<dt>4. Name two Pokémon whose level-up movepool becomes smaller upon evolution.</dt>
<dd>Any of: <strong>Arcanine, Togekiss, Vileplume, Bellossom, Wobbuffet, Cascoon, Silcoon, Metapod, Kakuna, and Ludicolo</strong>. The pre-evolution was acceptable as well.</dd>

<dt>5. In the Water 3 Egg group, the Pokémon have a total of seven types. What are they?</dt>
<dd><strong>Water, Ice, Poison, Bug, Rock, Grass, Psychic</strong>. A lot of people said Dark as well, due to Drapion, but I said "Water 3", meaning Water 3 only. Drapion is in two different Egg groups, and so doesn't qualify. Sorry, folks!</dd>

<dt>6. Out of the 11 moves with a 30% flinch rate, which is has the highest Base Power, and which one the lowest?</dt>
<dd><strong>Sky Attack</strong> sits high with 140, while <strong>Astonish</strong> is down at 30.</dd>

<dt>7. In Generation IV, name all fully evolved Fighting-types with only one ability.</dt>
<dd>Blaziken, Medicham, Infernape, Gallade, Fist Arceus. A-ha!, weren't expecting Arceus, eh? Think outside the box!</dd>

<dt>8. Which Flying-type Pokémon obtainable before the Elite Four (across all generations) has the highest Special Attack?</dt>
<dd>Rayquaza. Emerald version. Makes the game easy, but hey.</dd>

<dt>9. In Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia, how many Pokémon have the Field Ability "Recharge" of any value?</dt>
<dd><strong>7</strong>. There was no need to name them, but out of interest they were: Pichu, Pikachu, Raichu, Magnemite, Magneton, Chinchou and Lanturn.</dd>

<dt>10. Of all the "Serpentine" body-style Pokémon, which three have the highest Attack, in descending order from first to third?</dt>
<dd><strong>Rayquaza, Gyarados, Huntail</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
