<h2>Welcome to the Gen VI hub!</h2>

<p>This hub has material relating to the latest installment of Pok&eacute;mon&mdash;XY and ORAS. Announcements will be posted semi-frequently with news on the latest developments in the ORAS metagames, from Ubers down to NU.</p>

         <h3>Metagrossite Remains OU</h3>
         <p>Following the suspect test held for Mega Metagross, it was decided that since Mega Metagross didn't receive the supermajority vote required to be banned from OU, it should remain in the Overused tier for the foreseeable future. A detailed vote analysis is featured below.</p>
          <blockquote>Number of eligible voters: 335<br />
          Number of votes: 314<br />
          Ban: 180 (57,3%)<br />
          Do Not Ban: 134 (42,7%)<br /><br />

          Metagrossite doesn't achieve the required 60% pro-ban supermajority.<br /><br />

          For these reasons, Mega-Metagross will remain in OU. </blockquote>

         <h3>Steelixite, Heliolisk, Feraligatr, and Serperior Banned from NU</h3>
         <p>Following the suspect test held for Mega Steelix and Heliolisk, it was decided by supermajority vote that both Steelixite and Heliolisk would be banned from NU to RU. A detailed vote analysis is featured below.</p>
          <blockquote>Steelixite:<br />
          82 ban<br />
          15 do not ban<br />
          5 abstain<br /><br />
          
          Steelixite has been banned from NU with an 84.5% supermajority.<br /><br />
          Heliolisk:<br />
          88 ban<br />
          10 do not ban<br />
          5 abstain<br /><br />
          
Heliolisk has been banned from NU with an 89.8% supermajority. </blockquote>
         <p>Furthermore, as of recent legalization of Contrary Serperior and Sheer Force Feraligatr, the NU council decided that both should be quickbanned from the tier for a multitude of reasons. Below are detailed explanations of the reasoning behind the quickbans.</p>
          <blockquote><h4>Contrary Serperior</h4>
          Contrary Serperior has been deemed clearly overwhelming for NU, and it's really no question why if you played the metagame with Serperior at all. Having a STAB base 130 Nasty Plot at your hands whenever Serperior comes in reshapes the metagame entirely, and even all of the supposed checks for Serperior can be beaten by Serperior itself thanks to moves like Gastro Acid and Dragon Tail. Serperior is so uniquely dominant that it makes Pok&eacute;mon like Samurott and Feraligatr (traditionally fantastic NU Pok&eacute;mon) suboptimal team choices, and transforms the metagame into "who checks Serperior better". The ability to boost to +2 in a turn combined with Serperior's naturally high speed and ability to outmaneuver its checks and counters absolutely warrants a ban from NU.
          <h4>Sheer Force Ferligatr</h4>
          Feraligatr has been banned from NU due to its its ability Sheer Force, which made an already top threat ridiculously powerful, as most of its common moves got the Sheer Force boost. Feraligatr has excellent typing, above average bulk, and many different options that can all destroy different kinds of teams. All of Swords Dance, Dragon Dance, and Agility are viable as set up options, and all work very well against different kinds of teams. Even a special attacker set is viable to lure in traditional checks and counters to physical sets! The amount of power Feraligatr has compared to the rest of NU is ridiculous, as many teams were forced to run multiple subpar Pok&eacute;mon in hopes of beating Feraligatr. If you want more information about why Feraligatr was banned, read some of the many great posts in this thread, such as hollywood's post <a href="/forums/threads/np-stage-4-celebration-steelixite-and-heliolisk-banned.3528871/page-15#post-6084743">here</a>.</blockquote>

         <h3>Kangaskhanite Quick-Banned &amp; Updates to Endless Battle Clause</h3>
                <h4>Posted by Jukain on <strong>December 27, 2013</strong></h4>
                    <p>Following Gengarite, Kangaskhanite has been quick-banned from XY and Pok&eacute;bank OU. From the official statement of the OU Council:</p>
                    <blockquote>As we all know, Kangaskhan received a huge buff in X/Y with its Mega Stone. Its attack got pumped to a respectable base 125, its defenses were also improved, and its speed reached the above-average 100 base tier. The most valuable improvement it received though, was its new ability: Parental Bond. It allows the Pokémon to attack twice, with the second attack being half as powerful as the first one. Basically, Parental Bond acts like a free Choice Band boost, but without locking the user into one single attack. Also, Mega-Kangaskhan's new ability works wonderfully with attacks such as Power Up Punch (allowing Mega Kangaskhan to usually get 2 Attack boosts) and Seismic-Toss (which always inflicts a damage of 200 Hit Points to the opponent). Not to mention the ability to hit the opponent through their Substitute. Couple the above mentioned points with a close to perfect physical movepool (with access to coverage moves such as Fire Punch, Crunch and Earthquake) and priority in the form of Sucker Punch, and you have a Pokémon that's nearly impossible to counter or even revenge kill.</blockquote>
                    <p>With these buffs, the raw power of its attacks, limits on teambuilding, and versatility (it can also run an effective Wish / Protect / Seismic Toss / Crunch defensive set), Mega Kangaskhan was deemed broken. The full announcement can be read <a href="/forums/threads/kangaskhanite-is-now-banned-to-ubers.3495351/">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>On a different note, Endless Battle Clause has been updated to include two new combinations. These are Leppa Berry + Recycle + Pain Split and Leppa Berry + Recycle + Fling. The former works almost identically to the first banned combination, using Pain Split to heal the opponent instead of a recovery move. It is available to Mew. The latter can only be used against defensive Pok&eacute;mon that are unable to do much damage. Flinging a Leppa Berry increases the opponent's PP&mdash;it can be done infinitely with the help of Recycle whilst the user simply recovers back its health. Again, if you know of any strategies not yet banned under Endless Battle Clause, please report them to a tiering leader or a <a href="/mentorship/profiles/">Smogon Mentor</a>. The goal of this clause is to make sure the game is fair for everyone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="announcement">
            <h3>Endless Battle Clause</h3>
                <h4>Posted by Jukain on <strong>December 18, 2013</strong></h4>
                    <p>As per the decision of the Smogon tiering leaders, a new clause call the <strong>Endless Battle Clause</strong> will be put into effect in all official Smogon tiers, as noted <a href="/forums/threads/endless-battle-clause.3495355/">here</a>. The goal of the clause is to ensure that strategies able to create an endless game&mdash;one that only ends when the opponent's Pok&eacute;mon have all been PP stalled or he or she forfeits. Currently, this clause only encompasses the use of Leppa Berry, Recycle, Heal Pulse, Block/Mean Look/Spider Web, and a healing move (such as Recover or Softboiled) in the same moveset. This is how it works (writing provided by Hugendugen):
                    <blockquote>Fortunately only Slowpoke, Slowbro, Slowking, Blissey, and Smeargle are legally able to use this combination (Ralts, Kirlia, Gardevoir and Gallade as well if you count Wish). To use the strategy, one of these will switch into a defensive Pok&eacute;mon, or one unable to 2hko them, use Block and then PP stall the opponent with recovery and Leppa Berry + Recycle. Once the opponent begins to Struggle, the user can simply continue to Heal Pulse, with Leppa Berry + Recycle, until the opponent forfeits.</blockquote>
                    <p>This clause for now specifically blocks this strategy, but any strategies determined to have the ability to cause an indefinite battle will be banned under this clause in the future. If you find any such strategies, please report them to a tiering leader! If you don't feel comfortable doing that, contact a <a href="/mentorship/profiles/">Smogon Mentor</a> and he or she will definitely address your concern.</p>

            <h3>Gengarite is being Considered for a Quickban</h3>
                <h4>Posted by Jukain on <strong>November 21, 2013</strong></h4>
                    <p>Gengarite, which enables Gengar to transform into Mega Gengar, is currently up for discussion on the forums as a reference point for the OU Council to decide whether it will be given a quickban. Like in the cases of Blaziken and Deoxys-N, the Council, which consists of Aldaron, Haunter, M Dragon, McMeghan, and Nachos, would vote on whether or not to ban Gengarite. A simple majority (3/5) would secure a stress-free, simple ban. The Council has opened a discussion <a href="/forums/threads/gengarite-tiering-discussion-now-with-poll.3493175/">here</a> where you can get your voice heard. If you would like to help sway the view of the Council in this controversial vote, then post!</p>
                    <p>Gengarite is under quickban consideration primarily because of its ability, Shadow Tag, which traps the opposing Pok&eacute;mon in. This can have highly disurptive effects, allowing teammates troubled by certain walls to sweep due to their removal. The topic of debate is primarily whether this disruption is so significant that it is unhealthy for OU. Points of contention include the scope of its trapping abilities and limitations, which are the deciding factors in whether it should be quickbanned or not. Calls to wait for suspect testing proper have also been made. If you want to view high-quality discussion with points from both sides, check out <a href="/forums/threads/gengarite-tiering-discussion.3493146/">this discussion</a> in the Policy Review forum. In here, discussion is limited to badgeholders and select other members, so you can get the best possible perspective on the debate. In any case, no matter your views, share them and perhaps bring a few others over to your side!</p>

            <h3>Blaziken and Deoxys-N Quick-Banned from XY and PokéBank OU.</h3>
                <h4>Posted by Jukain on <strong>November 13, 2013</strong></h4>
                    <p>The OU council has concluded that Blaziken and Deoxys-N, two Pokémon allowed initially in XY, will be quick-banned from both current XY OU and PokéBank OU. This means that there will be no public vote; the council has simply decided that this is necessary. Both have been preeminent threats since XY's inception, and are detrimental to the balance of the tier. Blaziken is simply a monster sweeper. Its power is unparalleled, being virtually impossible to counter or even check if the player lacks a Talonflame or Azumarill on his or her offensive team. Defensive teams can opt for Slowbro, defensive Gyrados, or in PokéBank Jellicent, but these Pok&eacute;mon just are not cut out for any other team in this metagame. With the addition of Baton Pass to its movepool and thus the ability to passed the boost it gains from Swords Dance and Speed Boost, it can pass to a teammate that could handle it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Deoxys-N is also way too powerful for OU to handle. Its dual 150 offenses in addition to Speed give it plenty of power to work with, and a devastating STAB Psycho Boost as well as a list of coverage moves that goes on for days make it virtually impossible to handle with any Pok&eacute;mon&mdash;conventional or not. Deoxys-N was so obviously broken that there were some people who did not even realize it had been excluded from the initial banlist in the first place. It was not a Pok&eacute;mon OU could adequately deal with in any way. Therefore, it was banned.</p>
                    
                    <p>Actual suspect tests will likely not begin until PokéBank OU is released, so these will probably be the last bans until that time. Stay tuned for the latest XY!</p>
