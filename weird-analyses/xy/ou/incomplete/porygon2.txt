Overview
########

    Porygon2 is a very quirky Pokemon, but it pulls its weight of 71.6 pounds with honors in many different roles.
    Its fantastic coverage coupled with its strangely good defensive typing allows it to deal with many different threats effectively and still look good doing it.
    Its Eviolite access gives it sky-high defensive stats, and it has high Sp. Attack to boot.
    However, Porygon2's reliance on the Eviolite takes away passive recovery.
    Its great abilities also help it in many ways.
    The virtual duck is not without its flaws
    Its low Speed doesn't help it keep damage off, but it does assist Porygon2 in two ways: Analytic and Trick Room.
    Coupled with a godsend in Ghost immunity comes the very negative weakness to fighting. (fighting too stronk)
    Genderless is very interesting, as it halts all gender-based effects.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Recover
move 4: Toxic/Thunder Wave
ability: Trace
item: Eviolite
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP/240 Def/16 SpD

Moves
========

    Thunderbolt grants Porygon2 an excellent coverage opportunity, and coupled with Ice Beam is not resisted by many pokemon. It also grants Porygon2 the ability to deal with physical defenders.
    Ice Beam completes the coverage for Porygon2, and is a very powerful attack in its own right.
    Recover is an absolute necessity for this set, because it allows Porygon2 to stall poisoned opponents out and, more importantly, to heal itself.
    Either Toxic or Thunder Wave can be used as the status move, but Toxic is generally better because of the passive damage it inflicts.

Set Details
========

    Trace is the best ability for this set, because (as was mentioned) many pokemon pack abilities which grant immunity to their type. Flash Fire on Houndoom before Mega Evolution renders it about useless against Trace, for instance.
    Analytic is also an option for increased damage output, but lessens Porygon2's walling capabilities. It's not slashed due to Trace's general improvements.
    The Bold nature, together with this EV spread, makes Porygon2's defenses even more ridiculous, increasing both defenses at no cost to Porygon2.

Usage Tips
========

    This edition of Porygon2 can force switches, deal damage, and spread status.
    It plays very similarly to the almost identical defensive BW2 set, but it can be very different under pressure to have Thunderbolt against Conkeldurr instead of Discharge in the final moments of the battle.
    In a pinch, it can be used as a pivot, as well.
    This set counters mixed Aegislash, Salamence, and Haxorus and stops Garchomp in its tracks.

Team Options
========

    Support defensive Porygon2 with powerful attackers that can take out Fighting-types. Alakazam, Talonflame, and others are al very helpful.
    This set's role on a team can be anything, really, but it should most often be used as a tank.
    Be sure to keep a powerful Ghost-type on a team with this, to counter the ever-present Focus Blast.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Shadow Ball/Thunder Wave/Toxic
move 4: Recover
ability: Trace
item: Eviolite
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP/44 Def/212 SpD
Moves:
========

    Again, BoltBeam provides at least neutral coverage against nearly all opponents and when used with Porygon2's high Special Attack, both moves pack quite a bit of damage.
    Shadow Ball helps deal with the many special defenders weak to Ghost, as well as providing an efficient counter to Aegislash, who nearly wipes this set out with Sacred Sword, a physical attack.
    A status move can be used in this slot instead, for more stall-oriented needs.
    Recover is one of the best healing moves in the game, and it helps Porygon2 net recovery it misses from the lack of Leftovers.

Set Details
========

    The Calm nature buffs Special Defense in the same way that Bold buffs physical defense on the physical set.
    The EVs also mirror the physical set.
    Eviolite is, as on any set for Porygon2, a necessity because of the bulk it affords.
    In general, this set performs very similarly to the physically defensive set, just countering special sweepers instead.
    The abilities are used for the same reason as they are on the physically defensive set.

Usage Tips
========

    Any team that finds trouble with special attackers like Alakazam, Reuniclus, and special Aegislash should consider this variant of Porygon2.
    Many opponents are forced to switch by Porygon2's titanic bulk and Ghost immunity, allowing sweepers to get setup assistance by either defensive set.
    This set counters many special supportes, as well.
    Starmie, support Gengar, Thundurus, and others are all countered by this set. It can also switch very easily into Greninja, Alakazam, and many others.

Team Options
========

    Support this set with attackers that counter the plethora of physical Fighting-types in the tier.
    Breloom is a good option, as it can land sleep on Terrakion, Conkeldurr, and Keldeo and hit them for super-effective or neutral damage.
    Powerful physical walls like Skarmory also help Porygon2 out, as they can counter the fast physical attackers like Garchomp which are all too common in OU.
    Bug-, Ghost- and Dark-types counter the many Psychic-type special walls if Porygon2 is not carrying Shadow Ball.

Trick Room
########
name: Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Recover/Tri Attack
ability: Trace/Download
item: Eviolite
nature: Quiet/Relaxed
evs: 252 HP/ 252 SpA/ 4 SpD
Moves:
========

    Porygon2 also functions well as a dedicated Trick Room user.
    Its low Speed coupled with its high Special Attack makes it a very powerful Trick Room sweeper.
    The second moveslot can be filled with either Recover for healing, or Tri Attack as a STAB move. Shadow Ball could also be used here to hit Ghosts, but it's not recommended.
    The next slots also boost Porygon2's sweeping capabilities. BoltBeam is a classic and never fails.
    Hidden Power Fire is an excellent coverage opportunity on the very common Steel-types in the tier.

Set Details
========

    This EV spread sacrifices defenses (which are already huge with the Eviolite) for full-on tanking capabilities.
    The Quiet and Relaxed natures both drop speed, but this is useful for Trick Room.
    Trace is a great Ability, because many pokemon Porygon2 may come up against have abilities that grant immunities to their own types.
    Download is also helpful, and it is only with this ability that Facade (a physical attack) should be used. This is not necessary for Download, so feel free to use it with only special attacks.
    Analytic is not preferred for this set because Porygon2 will generally be moving first.

Usage Tips
========

    Use this variant of Porygon2 on Trick Room teams and stall teams.
    It tanks almost everything that can come at it as it sets up Trick Room.
    It can then sweep quite a few common enemies.

Team Options
========

    Reuniclus likes the extra moveslot if Porygon2 has Trick Room.
    Any coverage problems other sweepers on your team may have are, more often than not, solved by one of Porygon2's moves.

Other Options
########

    Porygon2 is such a versatile pokemon that there isn't much it can't do.
    These two sets are its most popular, but feel free to use any set that fills whatever niche spot you can't find a match for.
    One especially notable alternate move for Porygon2 is Foul Play. It provides coverage, as well as countering opponents with higher base Attack than Porygon2.
    On the defensive sets, Conversion 2 deserves mention because it can give Porygon2 useful resistances to Choice moves.
    One more move to note is Shadow Ball, which hits Ghost-types hard. This could be used on an Analytic sweeper set with BoltBeam and Recover.
    Psyshock can be used instead of Thunderbolt or Ice Beam if special defenders are proving a lot of trouble, but this sacrifices coverage and power.
    On both defensive sets, Analytic can be selected over Trace for more offensive power, but this gets rid of potential Ability-granted immunities.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-Type Pokemon and Moves**: Fighting is a ridiculously common offensive type, both for powerful STABs on Breloom, Terrakion, Conkeldurr and others, and in conjunction with the ubiquitous coverage move Focus Blast. Porygon2 has trouble taking out bulky Fighting-Types, and can usually be outsped and OHKOed or 2HKOed by Gengar and its ilk of Focus Blast users.

**Taunt**: Taunt prevents Porygon2 from Recovering and setting up Trick Room. This prevents Porygon2 from what is essentially its essence: tanking hits. Without any form of recovery due to its Eviolite reliance, Porygon2 must either switch or hope not to die after being Taunted. Trick Room is also rendered null if it can't be used.

**Trick, Knock Off, and Switcheroo**: Porygon2 is absolutely reliant on the Eviolite to work in any given situation, and any one of these three commonly seen moves can eliminate the item in an instant. Thus, Porygon2 should not stay in and hope to be successful against any known enemies with one of these moves.

**Status**: Porygon2 often sees itself afflicted with status, and without a teammate with Heal Bell, cannot get rid of it. Porygon2 can't use the Lum Berry, it can't use Psycho Shift, and it can't do anything to get rid of the poison that hurts it so often.
