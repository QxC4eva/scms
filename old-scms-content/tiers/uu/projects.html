<h2>Projects</h2>

<p><strong><a href="/forums/threads/the-uu-role-comparison-project.3485061/">The UU Role Comparison Project</a></strong> is a project that compares and contrasts many Pokemon that have a similar niche or function in UU.

<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3477626">The Next Best Thing</a></strong> is a project that aims to discover new sets for common Pokemon. A Pokemon is featured every week for people to design creative and effective sets for it. At the end of the week, users will vote on the most effective and creative set, and then a new Pokemon will be featured.</p>
