<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to burn the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Great Base Power, perfect accuracy, wide distribution... there really isn't a lot to hate when it comes to Flamethrower. The only reason you don't tend to see it as often as you might expect is the existence of Fire Blast, which trades 15% accuracy for a 25 point increase in Base Power. For the most part, you'll want to use Fire Blast if you're using a powerful offensive Pokemon that appreciates the extra KOs Fire Blast brings, while Flamethrower is recommended for slower, bulkier Pokemon that care more about consistency than raw power. Finally, if you ever feel down on your luck and suspect that Fire Blast's 85% accuracy is more akin to 50%, you can always swap out Fire Blast for Flamethrower.</p>
