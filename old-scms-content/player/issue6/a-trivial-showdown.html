<p>Welcome to the very first installment of A Trivial Showdown! This will run similarly to The Smog's Puzzle Page. Basically, just answer as many of the questions below as you can, and once you think you've got them, PM your solutions to <a href="/forums/conversations/add?to=The+Player">The Player</a> on Smogon. Correctly answered Easy questions are worth 1 point, Medium questions are worth 2, Hard questions are worth 3, and the Bonus question is worth 5 points. We'll announce the winners (the people with the most points) when the next issue of The Player rolls around. Prizes will be considered in the future for repeat participants/winners. Good luck and have fun!</p>

<h2>Puzzles</h2>

<div id="format" class="align-center">
    <p>Question: Hint</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Easy</strong> - Hangman. Fill out the rest of the word according to the hint.</p>

<ol>
    <li>_ o _ _ t _ _ _ r _: The original name of a PS Mod who has previously had the names "Truckster" and "Dickster" on Smogon.</li>

    <li>_ _ r _ a _ _ _: A PS Leader who has been an Admin at one point.</li>

    <li>_ _ _ m _ _ h a _: A PS Mod who is subject to the most puns.</li>

    <li>_ _ _ e _ _ n _: A sub-room of Wi-Fi for more focused discussion on this topic.</li>

    <li>_ _ U _ N - E: The specialized bot of the Tournaments room, created by sirDonovan.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Medium</strong> - Anagrams. Switch around the order of the letters to receive a PS related answer (ex. Need Hug Gun would be Hugendugen)</p>

<ol>
    <li>A Fermentation Jungle Shot: A PS staff member and a room he/she owns.</li>

<p><strong>Hard</strong> - "Psywaves" Questions. Use the clues to find synonyms to complete the full word. Be careful because this type of question is based on pronunciation. For example, when a clue is "A Letter" the letter may be R but be ar in the word. (ex. Onomatopoeia + Hole + A Letter would be Pupitar. Pew + Pit + Ar)</p>

<ol>
    <li>What + Male: PS staff member.</li>
