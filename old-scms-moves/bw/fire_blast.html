<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to burn the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Fire Blast is a reasonably strong offensive option for Pokemon requiring power and good coverage in one move. It is often seen competitively because of its utility and widespread distribution amongst many Pokemon outside of Fire-types, mainly most Dragon-types and some odd choices like Slowbro. Unlike other moves with a Base Power of 120, most of which have even lower accuracy, Fire Blast also has an adequate 85% chance of hitting the opponent, which is a fair trade-off considering Flamethrower, another similar move, has perfect accuracy, yet less power. Its use is most notable on both offensive and defensive Pokemon needing a way to dispose of Grass- and Steel-type Pokemon not named Heatran, the main targets being Ferrothorn and Scizor.</p>

<p>When choosing a Fire-type attack, consider that there are other attacks outside of Fire Blast that have their own uses and useful traits, mainly Flamethrower's perfect accuracy or Overheat's immediately higher Base Power. Choose which will fit your Pokemon's role on the team.</p>
