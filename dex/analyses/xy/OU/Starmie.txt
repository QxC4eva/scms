Overview
########

With the new generation and multiple changes to our metagame, Starmie isn't as effective as it once used to be. Defog is often the more preferred method of removing hazards, and Excadrill is the prime OU offensive Rapid Spinner, leaving little room for Starmie to flourish. However, it still has great base 115 speed and  amazng Bolt Beam + Hydro Pump coverage, allowing Starmie to still be a threat, and it has access to two great abilities in Natural Cure and Analytic. However, Starmie's typing leaves it vulnerable to common attacks such as Pursuit, U-turn, and Volt Switch. Play to Starmie's good points however, and it can be a great asset.


Offensive Spinner
########
name: Offensive Spinner
move 1: Hydro Pump / Surf
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Psyshock / Thunderbolt
move 4: Rapid Spin
ability: Analytic
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

This set plays to Starmie's natural offensive capabilities. Analytic is the ability of choice for its incredible power boost on the switch. Hydro Pump is STAB and hits stupidly hard on the switch, thanks to the boost Analytic provides and its awesome Base Power. Surf is an option, but Hydro Pump is favoured for its great power. Ice Beam provides nice coverage for Grass- and Dragon-types. Psyshock is the main option for Starmie as it's STAB and hits Mega Venusaur and Chansey for nice damage. Psyshock has a slim chance to OHKO Conkeldurr, which is a big threat in the metagame right now. Thunderbolt however offers more coverage, which allows Starmie to hit Water-types, and creates the awesome BoltBeam coverage. Finally, Rapid Spin is used as it supports the team by removing hazards.


Set Details
========

The EVs are used for maximum power and Speed. Surf can be used for more consistency, but overall Hydro Pump is generally better. You might think an all out attacking set could be useful, but Starmie is mainly used for its ability to Rapid Spin. Recover can also be an option, but Starmie really needs to coverage in order to be threatening.

Usage Tips
========

This set is more suited to offensive teams that rely on VoltTurn or a late-game sweeper that's weak to entry hazards (Talonflame, Volcarona, Dragonite, etc), so pairing it up with said Pokemon is a good idea. Starmie's main role of the game is to generally Rapid Spin, so make that your first priority over hitting something hard on the switch. If the removal of hazards isn't the number one priority, then generally spamming Hydro Pump is a good idea.

Team Options
========

As already stated, the best partners for Starmie are powerful sweepers that are weak to entry hazards, making Volcarona, Dragonite, and Talonflame your best options. Starmie is also pretty popular on VoltTurn teams, so good partners include Scizor. Scizor can beat all of Starmie's checks (Tyranitar, Blissey, etc), while Starmie can easily beat Scizor's checks (Heatran, Skarmory, etc).


Defensive Spinner
########
name: Defensive Spinner
move 1: Scald
move 2: Psyshock / Ice Beam
move 3: Recover
move 4: Rapid Spin
ability: Natural Cure
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 248 HP / 24 Def / 4 SpA / 232 Spe

Moves
========

This is generally a more defensive approach to Rapid Spinning with Starmie, and it's certainly viable with its typing, decent defenses, and access to Recover + Natural Cure. Scald is the main STAB move of choice as it has a nice 30% burn rate and solid Base Power. Psyshock is the second move of choice, since coverage isn't nearly as important on this set, and still allows Starmie to hit Keldeo, Conkeldurr, and Mega Venusaur hard. Ice Beam however can be considered, as it allows Starmie to hit Dragon-types for solid damage. Recover is used to keep Starmie healthy through out the match, allowing it to come in on an attack, Rapid Spin, and possibly Recover off all the damage. Finally, Rapid Spin supports the team by removing hazards.

Set Details
========

The EVs are used to outspeed Gengar, while placing most of the leftover EVs into HP and Defense. The 4 EVs invested into Special Attack ensure that you always OHKO Gengar. Psyshock is generally the best option for the coverage move, as it OHKOs Gengar 100% of the time after Stealth Rock. Ice Beam does in general offer much better coverage, enabling Starmie to hit Grass- and Dragon-types.


Usage Tips
========

This set is more suited to defensive teams that rely need a reliable Rapid Spinner. Starmie's typing allows it to switch into common Fighting- and Water-types, so this is generally when you should be trying to switch Starmie in. Starmie is capable of taking on Keldeo, Heatran, Skarmory, and Excadrill. Be careful about being trapped with this set, as without a lucky burn, Starmie is easily trapped by Tyranitar and Bisharp.


Team Options
========

Bulky Fire- and Grass-types really work nicely with Starmie, as they create a solid Water / Grass / Fire core. Heatran is generally the best defensive Fire-type, while Celebi, Amoonguss, and Mega-Venusaur are all candidates for a bulky Grass-type. Fighting-types are also great partners for Starmie, as they can break through Starmie's best checks, like Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W. Assault Vest Conkeldurr makes for a great partner, as it can easily switch into all three of these Pokemon.


Other Options
########

A full out attacker set can be considered, as it gives you incredible coverage, but the main reason to use Starmie it's for it's ability to Rapid Spin. Starmie can potentially run a Reflect type set, as it beats most of Starmie's checks, like Ferrothorn and Tyranitar, but it's kinda gimmicky, and Starmie doesn't have much room to run it. Hidden Power Fire is a coverage option that an be considered for it's ability to hit Ferrothorn and Scizor for solid damage, but outside of that there's little use for it.


Checks and Counters
########

Pursuit trappers can eliminate Starmie from the game. Tyranitar, Weavile, Bisharp, and Scizor all make for good Pursuit users. Blissey, Chansey, and other special walls can tank anything Starme throws at them, but they can't stop Starmie from Rapid Spinning. Ghost types stop Starmie from Spinning, so Gourgiest, Trevenent, and Aegislash can all be considered checks, and they also can hit Starmie for solid damage with their respective STAB attacks. Bulky Grass-types can usually take on Starmie easily. Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss can easily stand up to Starmie if it isn't running Psyshock, while Celebi and Ferrothorn counter it regardless.
