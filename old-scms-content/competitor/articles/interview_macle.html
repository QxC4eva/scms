<div class="aside"><p>I text macle back "sure give me a minute", in response to his "ill be over in a sec just gotta finish something". After a week of putting it off, he was finally going to come over to The Competitor's offices to finally get this silly interview over with. He had been over earlier that week, but wimped out, claiming he had a brunch to attend. When he left, I had discovered he had left a frog SOMEWHERE in the office, and I had spent the last few days searching for it on and off, working out of The Smog HQ for some peace and quiet. Eventually, he knocked on the door, and I gave up my frog-searching efforts, and welcomed him in.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Hello, macle! Thanks for doing this interview with us! Can you tell us a bit about your history regarding joining the Smog Frogs roster? As a manager, that is.</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>Well, its kinda a boring story. Basically I heard there was a SMOG Frog team and that LN was the manager. As someone who loves frogs, I had to be a part of it. LN and I have history together, he was my tutor in DP UU a thousand years ago, so I asked if I could be an assman and he said yes.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>What team got renamed to such a horrible name?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>macle stared at me, biting back an insult.</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>The Dragonspiral Tyrants, if I recall correctly.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Ah, alright. How IS LonelyNess, anyway?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>As a manager, or in general?</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>In general.</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>A lot of people don't really like LN for some reason. I don't really understand why.  He's a nice guy and really cares about the team. He is dumb sometimes, like at VGC Nationals last year, he didn't pack a swimming suit or even shorts that he could wear to swim.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Interesting. OK, regarding the team as a whole: You're currently in 5th place, 1 slot away from going to semi-finals, after being a team jeered during the auction (Hi, Funkasaurus). What did you do right?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>Well, we drafted really well for the most part. We picked up good players at reasonable prices. We also prepare really hard for our opponents each week.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Speaking of reasonable priced, what do you think of the insane upbidding LN pulled off during the auction, especially when it comes to Bloo?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>macle laughs, and his eyes sparkle.</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>LN's aggressive bidding is hilarious. It works most of the times but if you remember last SPL, he upbid Evan. Evan HATES LN which really hurt our team. Also the bloo upbidding was hilarious as hell. I knew LN didn't want Bloo (and Bloo didn't want to be a frog). I wouldn't have started the auction over but who cares.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>There were some people who cared about the auction restart, but OK! Were there any players you could have gotten during the auction that you missed out on?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>Pwnemon. We settled for Joim (who, at the beginning of the season, we didn't know how good he was). Also, I really wanted Raichy, but the Tigers stole him from us.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>That'll do to segway to my next question. What are your thoughts about the way the tier lineup was decided?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>As an LC mod and long time player, I was happy about the addition of LC. I've been trying to get it in SPL for a long time (ask Fabbles how happy I was when it wasn't in last year). At first I was upset that VGC was dropped for Doubles, since I have gone to VGC events and have tons of friends that play it, but I picked up playing the tier, and I actually enjoy it more than current VGC '14. RBY is kinda interesting since there was barely even 15 players that even played it and you had to resurrect half of them from the dead.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>macle quickly tacks on that he meant no offense to RBY as a meta, but its playerbase just died.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Jumping to the other pre-season drama, what is your thoughts on the accusations of dynasty creation in SPL? Good, bad, what?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>I don't really like that teams are basically picked before the auction. The auction is one of the best parts of SPL. We already have a team tournament that is dynasty filled so having diversity in tournaments is important in my opinion.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Cool! What players would you retain if a 3-player retain limit is put in play?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>Heysup and Tesung. Those are the users worth the retain price. Maybe Furai.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>OK. Your team has a fair amount of "spotlight" users&mdash;aa40, rey, sogeking, and Dezkeh, off the top of my head. How's your IRC channel look like?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>Well, it's a lot better than last spl when 90% of the chat was in Spanish or Portuguese. We get along fairly well (except for rey and soge but soge has learned not to annoy rey that much). Its lonely in there when LN is in jail.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>My eyes widen. I had heard rumors, but...</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Did he really go to jail?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>I'm pretty sure he went to jail. We tried to message him on facebook and stuff but he never responded. We actually thought he was dead.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>What would happen if he actually did die?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>Celebrate.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Between this, and the sogeking/rey combination you mentioned earlier, your team clearly likes each other!</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>We just love to give him shit 24/7, it's all for fun!</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Speaking of... I'm gonna ask you about some of the more ubiquitous users this SPL (General Talk Thread), if you don't mind?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>macle nods, slightly distracted by some IRC channel. On looking at my IRC client open, I look back at macle, who now has a devilish grin on his face. I type out a retort quickly, only to have an obscene bot ruin the retort by mimicking it, and adding an obscene word. I look back at macle.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Laurel, WhiteQueen, and MasterClass.</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>WhiteQeen just needs to STFU. Masterclass is hilarious, and I love his trolling. I've yelled at him a few times when he crosses the line, but he's learned. Laurel also needs to learn to STFU. He gets a lot of shit, but he also talks a lot of shit. Better to keep quiet and look like a fool, as opposed to speaking to confirm it.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Alright, two more high quality users to ask about, both on your team. The first being yan[sogeking], and the second being aerialace TM40.</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>yan[sogeking] is a genius, through and through. He's just too smart, he doesn't know how to act properly. AA gets drunk too often, and you can see that in his posts.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>That's the effect of being drunk?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>No, it's brain damage from excessive drinking. At least, that's my guess. As long as he can play Pok&amp;eacute;mon, I'm happy.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I make a mental note to never drink, ever.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>OK, let's start wrapping up. Will reyscarface ever win a match?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>I hope, but I really don't know. He is a hax magnet: he gets into a winning position, and then something bullshit happens, and he can't recover. Someone should just let him win a match.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>So all that complaining is real?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>At least for this SPL, yes.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Nice to know. One final question: what is ur fav frog mon?</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>Poliwag.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>But that's a tadpole...</p></div>

<div class="speaker macle"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_macle.png" alt="macle" /><p>Is a kitten not a cat?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>As I try to make heads or tails of that retort, macle packs his stuff up, leaving the building. I go back to working on my various projects for a couple of minutes, only to hear a distinctive *ribbit* from somewhere behind me. I immediately packed up my stuff, and walked out of the office, leaving a sticky note for Jellicent when he would stumble in later tonight, promising him some beer money if he found the frog.</p></div>
