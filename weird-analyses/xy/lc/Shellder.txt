Shell Smash
########
name: Shell Smash Sweeper
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Rock Blast
move 3: Razor Shell / Icicle Spear
move 4: Ice Shard
ability: Skill Link
item: Eviolite
evs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 36 Def / 196 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

- Shell Smash can be used to monstrously boost Shellder's offensive capabilities and bypass its would-be counters. 
- Rock Blast / Razor Shell are the main attacking moves with the best coverage, however they do have shaky accuracy. Icicle Spear can be used but that means Steel-types are hard to bypass. 
- Ice Shard is necessary to hit Fletchling and Murkrow before they hit Shellder with priority. It also causes Sucker Punch to fail. 


Set Details
========

- Max Attack EVs and Adamant to hit as hard as possible. 
- Enough speed to reach 26 after Shell Smash, outspeeding most common scarfers.
- Jolly is an option, to speed tie with Scarfed Murkrow and Misdreavus, but generally it prefers the power.
- Eviolite to grant +1 defenses pre-boost and to nullify the defenses drop.

Usage Tips
========

- Once counters are weakened, set up Shell Smash on a weaker opponent or on a switch. And proceed to sweep.
- Shellder can bypass Focus Sashers and some Sturdy users with Rock Blast.
- Due to its Physical defense, Shellder finds it easy to set up on many Physical attackers such as Mienfoo, Drilbur, Ponyta and Subtitute Murkrow. 


Team Options
========

- If you're not running Razor Shell, Magnemite and Diglett can be useful for trapping Steel-types.
- Knock Off support can aid Shellder in weakening bulky Fighting-types and other physical walls such as Spritzee.
- Hazard support is greatly appreciated to remove Sturdy from the likes of Magnemite.

Scarfed Revenge Killer
########
name: Scarfed Revenge Killer
move 1: Icicle Spear
move 2: Rock Blast
move 3: Razor Shell
move 4: Ice Shard
ability: Skill Link
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 36 Def / 196 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

- Icicle Spear and Rock Blast are powerful multi-hit revenge killing moves. 
- Ice Shard lets Shellder deal with Fletchling and Murkrow before they use their priority moves. 

Set Details
========

- Max Speed and Jolly are required to hit 14 speed and outpace the metagame after a Choice Scarf boost. 
- Rest of EVs go into Attack, and leftover EVs go into HP and Defense for bulk. 

Usage Tips
========

- Should be used as a revenge killer and check for offensive-based Pokemon even with a Substitute up. 
- Can be a fairly strong late-game cleaner of the opponent's Pokemon are weakened. 

Team Options
========
- Fits well with something that can take hits after it successfully revenge kills something. Chinchou can take the Electric-type attacks, Magnemite can as well and also take Grass-type attacks. 
- Fighting-types are bulky enough to take Icicle Spears, so a Fighting-type counter such as Trubbish can be used. 

Other Options
########

- Rapid Spin can be used as a filler move on a defensive set. 
- Surf can be used over Razor Shell for better accuracy. 

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Bulky and can heal their HP back up with Drain Punch.

**Magnemite**: Avoids KOes with Sturdy and resists Icicle Spear and Rock Blast. Can KO back with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch.
