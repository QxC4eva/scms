<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder's Speed is boosted by one stage at the end of each turn. Speed Boost will not activate at the end of the turn that the wielder switches in.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This ability single-handedly sent <a href="/bw/pokemon/blaziken">Blaziken</a> from solidly UU in DPP to Uber in BW. It is a great ability, and most of the Pokemon with it can make for solid cleaners. <a href="/bw/pokemon/sharpedo">Sharpedo</a> has brute force on its side, and can easily sweep a team with its brute force and coverage. <a href="/bw/pokemon/yanmega">Yanmega</a> is strong and is an excellent user of the ability, although <a href="/bw/abilities/tinted_lens">Tinted Lens</a> as another great ability. You will see it occasionally, especially in UU.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Speed Boost is one of the factors that makes <a href="/bw/pokemon/ninjask">Ninjask</a> stand out as a <a href="/bw/moves/baton_pass">Baton Pass</a> user, as all the Speed boosts accumulated while it is on the field can be passed on, thus making it easy to pass a couple of Speed boosts on if your opponent does not have a phazer or a Pokemon with <a href="/bw/moves/taunt">Taunt</a>; if they do, however, Ninjask tends to die very quickly.</p>
