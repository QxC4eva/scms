Blocks evasion modifiers. Allows user's Fighting- and Normal-type moves to hit Ghosts.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Causes the target to have its positive evasion stat stage set to 0 while it is active. Normal- and Fighting-type attacks can hit the target if it is a Ghost-type. The effect ends when the target is no longer active. Fails if the target is already affected. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Another utility move; however, you won't see it in the majority of matches. Simply put, hitting Ghost-type Pokemon is not a hard task. Instead of reserving a slot for this you can put a move that hits said Pokemon harder if that's your concern. Also, the majority of viable users of this move have a secondary STAB or sufficiently powerful coverage moves to deal with Ghosts anyway.</p>

<p>However, someone could make a case for the benefits of using a move like Rapid Spin in conjunction with Odor Sleuth. While the only one that can use said strategy with this move is Donphan, it can be extremely useful in order to get a guaranteed Rapid Spin, if your team is overly concerned with entry hazards. Of course, Donphan will usually prefer to hit those Pokemon blocking his spins with his STAB Earthquake, or something like Assurance on the switch, as that cannot be stopped by Taunt.</p>
