Overview
########

- Fantastic glue Pokemon for many teams.
- Great check to Fire, Ground, and Flying types.
- Amazing typing, both offensive and defensive.
- Great ability that goes perfectly with its typing.
- Middling speed makes it susceptible to powerful moves.
- Unfortunately low HP stat.
- Grass- and Dragon-types resist it's moves tho

Special Tank
########
name: Special Tank
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Protect / Electroweb / Light Screen
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 252 HP / 132 SpA / 124 SpD
nature: Modest

Moves
========
- Rotom-W's most consistent set, doing respectable damage while having the ability to take multiple hits with ease.
- Hydro Pump is the main offensive choice, and can OHKO Landorus-T, offensive Heatran, and Volcarona
- Thunderbolt has great coverage, as it hits Water-types
- Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are the two options if running Sitrus Berry; Will-o-Wisp for most physical attackers, Thunder Wave for speed control. Volt Switch is used on the Choice Specs set.
- Protect helps scout moves and play around opposing offensive strategies.
- Electroweb is a great move for Speed control: it is basically Icy Wind with Electric typing.

Set Details
========
- Max HP / Max SpA for optimizing the role of a bulky offensive tank.
- Different spread of 252 HP / 88 SpA / [rest of evs] SpD with a Calm nature will help Rotom-W tank special attacks better. SpA evs are for OHKOing Landorus-T with pump.
- 52 Spe EVs works well with Electroweb: outspeed Mega Charizard and Mega Kangaskhan after a Speed reduction.
- Sitrus Berry is the safer option, and allows it to use Protect
- ChestoRest is an option for healing.

Usage Tips
========
- Rotom-W is to be used as an offensive glue - it should be able to switch into its teammates' counters and deal a lot of damage back or burn them.
- It is able to put a stop to a large amount of Pokemon (most Fire-, Water-, and Flying-types) [list some examples of popular mons here (Tran, landog, burd), and mention how it comfortably tanks SlideQuake, a popular coverage option]
- Rotom-W can and should also be used as a status spreader; especially if running Will-o-Wisp, since crippling physical attackers will benefit you throughout the match.

Team Options
========
- Steel-types such as Scizor and Metagross make great partners, as they wall Dragon- and Grass-types.
- Offensive Fire- and Ice-types such as Heatran and Weavile help take out Grass-type Pokemon that bother Rotom-W. Fire-types even take advantage of their presence, as they often can do nothing in return.
- Ground-types synergize well with Rotom-W, as they can freely use Earthquake beside it. Mamoswine deserves special mention, since it takes out Dragon- and Grass-type mons.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Thunderbolt / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Trick / Hidden Power Ice
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 52 HP / 252 SpA / 204 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
- Hydro Pump as it's the strongest water STAB that Rotom has access to.
- Volt Switch is a secondary STAB move, hits waters, and provides momentum.
- Thunderbolt acts as a more reliable, more powerful STAB Electric move, and Hidden Power Ice hits Dragons (Latios, Hydreigon, Chomp)
- Trick for crippling everything, HP Ice if you decide to run all out attacking.

Set Details
========
- Scarf Rotom-W is meant to be as fast and powerful as possible, so max SpA / Spe, but with a 50% boost to Speed, a Modest nature will suffice.
- EVs outspeeds Shaymin-S after the scarf boost. This will miss out on Mega Manectric and Crobat though.
- Will-O-Wisp is another option for this set to burn fast threats (such as Kangaskhan).

Usage Tips
========
- Faster, offensive Pokemon weak to its STAB moves, such as Landorus-T, Mega Charizard Y, and Terrakion are its main targets, and can either be genereally checked or surprise OHKOd.
- Crippling supportive Pokemon with Trick is a good use of Scarf - works especially well against Trick Room setters.

Team Options
========
- Fire-types are great partners for this Rotom-W. Fire-types can handle the Grass-types that Rotom struggles against. Rotom surprise kills the Ground- and Rock-type mons.
- Again, Steel types have amazing defensive synergy with it.
- Ground-types again, especially Landorus-T, since they form a solid VolTurn core.

Other Options
########

- Choice Specs
- Assault Vest 
- HP Grass for Gastrodon
- Thunder Wave
- Pain Split

Checks and Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: 

Grass-types mostly, and some mention of Dragons resisting and hitting back hard neutrally.

**Speed**: 

Low HP stat means it takes a lot of damage from powerful neutral attacks such as Latios Draco Meteor, Mega Kangaskhan Return, Terrakion Close Combat.
