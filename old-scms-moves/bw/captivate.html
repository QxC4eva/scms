Lowers an opposite gender target's Special Attack by 2 stages.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Special Attack by two stages. A target is unaffected if both the user and the target are the same gender, or if either is genderless. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Pokemon with the ability Oblivious are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Using Captivate competitively is certainly not recommended; the attack is neither reliable nor rewarding. Though the majority of Pokemon used on simulators are male, and as such Captivate may succeed more often than not when used by a female Pokemon, the move will still fail against the common genderless Pokemon, as well as against opponents who take care to use female Pokemon to prevent such a situation from occurring. Also, as previously mentioned, this attack is not especially effective even when it succeeds, since the opponent can simply switch out, negating the Special Attack drops.</p>
