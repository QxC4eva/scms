<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage, and the user receives recoil damage equal to 1/4 of its maximum HP, rounded half up. Cannot be learned or be a part of a Pokemon's moveset. Can only be used if the user has no PP for any of its moves, or is locked on one move with no PP left, or is unable to use any moves due to an effect (eg. Taunt, Heal Block) but decides to attack regardless. Does not prevent user from switching out instead of attacking. Pokemon with the ability Rock Head still receive recoil damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>I'm struggling to think of any reason you'd want to voluntarily use this move, let alone use it competitively.</p>
