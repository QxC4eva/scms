<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Poison-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed during the damage calculation. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Poison-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Kebia Berry is a type-resist Berry that reduces the damage taken from a super effective Poison-type move by 50%. With the prevalence of Steel-types and the overall awful coverage that Poison offers, offensive Poison-type moves rarely see any use. As such, the Kebia Berry is outclassed in almost every single manner.</p>

<p>The best potential user of Kebia Berry is Ludicolo, due to Poison being one of its only three weaknesses. In the Ubers metagame, Ludicolo could take advantage of its Rain Dish ability in conjunction with Kyogre's infinite rain for reliable recovery, while holding a Kebia Berry to allow Ludicolo to survive a Poison move that an opponent may try to throw at it. In fact, during VGC 2010, when Ludicolo became such a prevalent threat that players started using Poison-type moves against it, some players let their Ludicolo hold a Kebia Berry to help survive such moves.</p>

<p>Overall, a Pokemon such as Ludicolo would benefit more from Leftovers in most cases, making Kebia Berry a far inferior item.</p>
