<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a high critical hit rate.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Crabhammer is an exclusive move for the Kingler line. While Surf is more reliable and has 5 more Base Power, Crabhammer has a high critical hit rate, which means Kingler is going to get a critical hit with this move almost always. However, keep in mind that Kingler has a low 50 Special, so it will absolutely need the critical hit to deal any damage. It will be able to overcome Amnesia and Growth boosts, though.</p>
