<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>CAP is a simple metagame to grasp, despite what randomly  jumping into the battling scene might initially suggest. In the <a  href="/smog/issue11/cap_vs_ou">first volume</a> of OU vs. CAP,  we covered how play styles themselves differ from OU to CAP. In this  article, we will focus more on some very key threats to be aware of and  their resulting impact on how you make your teams. Since many of you  will come straight from OU, with little or no knowledge of CAP, you'll  probably play your first few matches using a OU team. This will work  remotely well, but you'll want to fine-tune your team further to deal  with the very specific threats that CAP has introduced. In order to do  that, you must first understand the threats and how to beat  them.</p>

<h2>The Major Threats</h2>

<p>Despite the fact that we, as a community, have put a lot of effort into  balancing the CAP Pokemon, they continue to dominate the metagame. Below  is a list of some of the CAP Pokemon with the most unique of niches.  These Pokemon have such a serious impact on the metagame that they  directly influence how successful teams are made for the metagame.  Fortunately, all of these Pokemon are readily dealt with by standard  Pokemon in the OU tier or other CAP Pokemon.</p>

<h3>Revenankh</h3>

<p>Revenankh has all of the right stats in all of the right  places, the right ability, and the right movepool to do what he was  intended to do: set up numerous Bulk Up boosts and sweep your team. The  set you'll want to be making sure you can handle is as  follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://cap.smogon.com/Sprites/frontnormal-mrevenankh.png" alt="" /><br />
Revenankh @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Shed Skin<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Careful nature (+SpD, -SpA)<br />
- Bulk Up<br />
- Hammer Arm<br />
- Shadow Sneak<br />
- Rest</p>

<p>One of Revenankh's greatest assets is perfect neutral type  coverage between just two attacks. This allows Revenankh to use Rest  alongside Shed Skin to keep healthy. Needless to say, this Revenankh is  terribly annoying and almost impossible to beat without either  substantial hax or proper planning. If you're looking for CAP Pokemon to  check Revenankh, the three best Pokemon for the job are Kitsunoh, Fidgit, and Arghonaut.  Kitsunoh can use ShadowStrike to penetrate even a boosted Revenankh's  defenses and 2HKO him, while avoiding a 3HKO in return. Fidgit can  switch in on any move of Revenankh's and Encore it, turning Revenankh  into setup fodder. Lastly, Arghonaut ignores all of Revenankh's boosts  and can force him out with powerful Water-type attacks. If you'd prefer a  more classic OU route, don't be tempted to use Tyranitar! Revenankh,  unlike every Ghost-type Pokemon in OU, is neutral to Dark-type attacks.  Instead, choose something bulkier and not weak to Fighting-type attacks.  Skarmory makes an excellent response to Revenankh by threatening to  2HKO him with Brave Bird or phazing him with Whirlwind. Revenankh is  also deathly afraid of being crippled by Trick. Choice Scarf Jirachi is  an excellent candidate for this with access to super effective Zen  Headbutt, Iron Head for flinching, or Trick to take Revenankh out.  Choice Band Azelf can perform the role well too, but takes a serious hit  from Shadow Sneak before dropping Revenankh with Zen Headbutt. Agility  Metagross can even go so far as to set up on Revenankh and proceed to  destroy him with Zen Headbutt.</p>

<h3>Stratagem</h3>

<p>Stratagem is a Pokemon that, despite your best efforts, you  will have difficulty handling with a normal OU offense team. If your  team happens to be carrying Blissey, you'll be home free, but if not... You run the risk of it cleanly sweeping your  team. Stratagem has immense super effective coverage, a great base 120  Special Attack stat, and a blistering base 130 Speed stat. If your team  can handle the following set in some fashion, you'll be able to deal  with pretty much anything Stratagem can throw at you.</p>

<p><img src="http://cap.smogon.com/Sprites/frontnormal-mstratagem.png" alt="" /><br />
Stratagem @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- AncientPower<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Earth Power / Vacuum Wave</p>

<p>It looks intense, doesn't it? Stratagem achieves perfect type  coverage in those four moves and becomes impossibly hard to switch into  without perfect prediction skills. However, in OU and CAP there exist a  few hard stops to Stratagem as well as some solid checks that put it in  its place. Blissey, as mentioned before, stops Stratagem hard with her  immense special bulk. Once she's in, she can pretty much have her way  with Stratagem. In CAP, the special wall Revenankh is a good choice to  beat Stratagem. So long as you have a healthy Revenankh in the wings of  your offense team, Stratagem will never sweep your team. If neither of  these complete special walls strikes your fancy, then priority attacks  are your next best option for breaking Stratagem. Scizor's Bullet Punch  annihilates Stratagem, but Scizor will take a serious hit switching in.  If Breloom can get in on a resisted move, he can threaten Stratagem with  an OHKO through the use of Mach Punch. Choice Scarf users, like Flygon  or Jirachi, will destroy Stratagem once they get in. The trick is  getting them in safely. Basically, the rule of thumb for beating  Stratagem without a dedicated special wall is to play smart and always  try to maintain the upper hand. If it predicts correctly once or twice,  it can mean the end of one of your precious Pokemon.</p>

<h3>Arghonaut</h3>

<p>Arghonaut is a pest, through and through. He can switch into  pretty much any setup sweeper, such as Dragonite, Gyarados, Infernape,  or even Lucario, and beat them soundly thanks to his ability, Unaware.  As if that weren't enough, Arghonaut poses a serious offensive threat  with his base 110 Attack stat and he can easily capitalize on the  switches he forces by setting up a Substitute. The set you should really  be concerned with, though, is his defensive set.</p>

<p><img src="http://cap.smogon.com/Sprites/frontnormal-marghonaut.png" alt="" /><br />
Arghonaut @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Unaware<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def<br />
Impish nature (+Def, -SpA)<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Low Kick<br />
- Stone Edge / Ice Punch<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>Fortunately, Arghonaut is not a difficult beast to handle, but  he does force your hand a bit in team building. Super effective attacks,  particularly those with STAB, will beat Arghonaut into the ground.  Starmie can switch into either of Arghonaut's STAB attacks and threaten  him with a Life Orb-boosted Thunderbolt. Celebi completely walls  Arghonaut, avoiding a 2HKO from even Ice Punch, and messes him up with  Grass Knot. Shaymin doesn't resist Fighting-type attacks, but will  cleanly OHKO Arghonaut with STAB Seed Flare. Zapdos makes an excellent  switch-in to Arghonaut as well, resisting Fighting-type attacks and  waving a Thunderbolt at him. If you decided to run Pokemon with STAB  Psychic-type attacks to deal with Revenankh, you'll find those Pokemon  also end up being handy against Arghonaut. Azelf, Jirachi, and Metagross  all crush Arghonaut with their STAB attacks.</p>

<h3>Colossoil</h3>

<p>Up until now, you've been led to believe that Psychic-type  attacks were somehow marvelous in this metagame. Don't get me wrong,  they are&mdash;at least until Colossoil switches into one of them. This  behemoth is bulky, and, while not fast, has Sucker Punch to make your  life that much more difficult. Make sure that you have a way to deal  with the following set in your team.</p>

<p><img src="http://cap.smogon.com/Sprites/frontnormal-mcolossoil.png" alt="" /><br />
Colossoil @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Guts<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Taunt / Stone Edge</p>

<p>It seriously says something about Colossoil when he actually  <em>replaces</em> Tyranitar in the metagame. Between Sucker  Punch and Pursuit, your Dark-type weak Pokemon have to play a mindgame  for the slightest chance to survive. If you are using a Choice set and  are stuck into a Psychic-type move, your Pokemon is pretty much dead.  That said, Colossoil is not nearly as bulky as Tyranitar,  although he is still very bulky. Skarmory deals with Colossoil in ways  nothing else can. Since Colossoil can't recover off damage and will  Taunt Skarmory, just attack him with Brave Bird to do some damage. That  damage racks up with Life Orb and will KO Colossoil before long.  Grass-type Pokemon that aren't Celebi also fare extremely well against  Colossoil because they aren't weak to any of his typical attacks.  Beware, though! Because of STAB on Earthquake, frail Grass-types like  Breloom are still 2HKOed by Colossoil! Shaymin is a great check even  with an offensive set as it can survive Sucker Punch and OHKO with Seed  Flare. Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Suicune will  function the same way, taking an Earthquake and OHKOing in return.

<h3>Pyroak</h3>

<p>Pyroak is a very powerful Pokemon with amazing type coverage.  Between his Grass- and Fire-type STAB attacks, he pretty much covers  every defensive Pokemon in the game. At the very least, however, Pyroak  is very exploitable. He is always slower than Tyranitar, and is weak to  Rock-type attacks. He will take 25% damage upon switching into battle and can  be OHKOed after that by powerful super effective attacks. The set to  watch out for is listed below.</p>

<p><img src="http://cap.smogon.com/Sprites/frontnormal-mpyroak.png" alt="" /><br />
Pyroak @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Rock Head<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- Wood Hammer<br />
- Earthquake / Stone Edge</p>

<p>Typically, Pyroak will run Earthquake to deal with Heatran, but  he can also run Stone Edge to put Dragonite down. His type coverage  with this set is monstrous, and pretty much your only chance to beat him  is to take him down in one fell swoop. Fortunately, Tyranitar is 1 base  Speed faster than Pyroak and can OHKO him with STAB Stone Edge. If you  want to try a CAP, Choice Specs Stratagem can OHKO Pyroak after Stealth  Rock damage with Paleo Wave. Aerodactyl can switch in on the turn that  Pyroak uses Swords Dance and OHKO him with STAB Stone Edge after Stealth  Rock damage. Anything with a powerful Flying-type attack also maims  Pyroak. Choice Band Crobat and Life Orb Staraptor both OHKO Pyroak with  Brave Bird. In a pinch, anything with Explosion that's faster, such as  Heatran, can take Pyroak out.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So CAP is a place of new Pokemon and new challenges. Your  top-notch OU teams may do respectably in this metagame, but until  they're tweaked to deal with the new threats, you really won't be  achieving nearly as much success as you'd like. The above listed  offensive and defensive threats are the ones that change the metagame  the most from OU to CAP. There exist lots of other Pokemon that can be  problematic, like Fidgit or Kitsunoh, but many of them can be dealt with  by their types and movepools alone and won't completely decimate your  strategies. Krilowatt, for instance, can be largely dealt with by Grass-  or Ground-type attacks. Fidgit functions a lot like Forretress, but  with a fast Encore, lower Defense, and a weakness to Ground-type  attacks. Other such Pokemon exist as well, but the general trends  remain. Follow the tips I've listed above and you'll find yourself  building teams much more in tune with the threats, both offensive and  defensive, that lurk in the CAP metagame.</p>
