<h2>Welcome to the Other Metagames Premier League!</h2>

<p>We had a wonderful OMPL this season, the winners were ultimately <strong>the Bedroom Blisseys</strong>.

<br />
<p>This week kicks off OMPL with a bang, pairing up many great players versus each other. Special highlight is Pikachuun versus Asterat, two wonderful Balanced Hackmons players. Ultimately, Pikachuun overcame Asterat for the win. Beginning this week we had the Bedroom Blisseys paired against the Childish Charizards. This was by far the closest pairing this week, with w0rd carrying through and pulling the Blisseys to victory. This begining was a bit rough for the Swamperts, along with the latis, but this was only the first match! This week was a great kick off and helped the players get a feel of what they were up against.</p>

Heavy work in progress!
