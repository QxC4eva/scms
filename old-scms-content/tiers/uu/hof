<p>Winner: <strong>FlareBlitz</strong></p>
<p>Runner-up: kokoloko</p>

<p>The very first mini-tournament put a twist on the Underused metagame, seeing low-usage Pokemon from the Overused tier drop down to conglomerate with old friends in this tournament. Flareblitz, a veteran member of the Underused community, was able to exploit a Grass Knot Tornadus to power himself over the runner ups kokoloko and Noblesse Oblige and take the title!</p>

<h4><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3469476">Mini-Tournament #2: No-Hazards UU</a></strong></h4>

<p>Winner: <strong>RT.</strong></p>
<p>Runner-up: kokoloko</p>

<p>The second tournament took one of the most vital aspects to the Underused tier, removed it, and set its players into combat against each other, having to rely on powerful attacks and quality match-ups to power through walls and tanks. After a month of top-notch battles and kokoloko once again upsetting Omicron in a semi-final match, RT, another veteran member of the Underused community, prevailed as the winner!</p>

<h4><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3472614">Mini-Tournament #3: Back from the Future</a></strong></h4>

<p>Winner: <strong>RT.</strong></p>
<p>Runner-up: DestinyUnknown</p>

<p>The third UU Mini-Tournament gave contestants some new toys to play with. It started right before the October tier shifts, and allowed players to use a handful of predicted UU drops. Abomasnow, Meleotta, Metagross, Mew, Tornadus, and Virision were added to the list of useable Pokemon, and battlers had to anticipate the changes to the metagame. RT again claimed victory after three great games with DestinyUnknown.</p>

<p>Winner: <strong>Ace Emerald</strong></p>
<p>Runner-ups: SOMALIA and fatty</p>

<p>The second edition of Slumming It In UU brought down several Pokemon that were close to UU usage, most notable Haxorus and Reuniclus. Ace Emerald defeated SOMALIA and fatty in the last round, utilizing the overwhelming might of Haxorus and the combination of bulk and power that Reuniclus provided.</p>

<h4><strong><a href="/forums/threads/the-apocalypse-mini-tournament-round-1.3487818/">The Apocalypse Mini-Tournament</a></strong></h4>

<h4><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3470139">The UU Mafia</a></strong></h4>

<p>Winner: <strong>RT.</strong></p>
<p>Runner-ups: Double01, Pokemazter</p>
<p>Hosted by PK Gaming</p>

<p>The last of the tiers to begin a Mafia-themed challenge also had a very short run with the idea. Although a winner in RT., beating all 5 bosses in 25 days, and 2 runners up (Double01 managing 3 wins in 25 days and Pokemazter, 2), the Mafia was deemed to be dying, as support from its current bosses was waning. PK Gaming has however promised another challenge similar to the Underused Mafia.</p>

<h4><strong><a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3476454">The UU Mafia 2</a></strong></h4>

<p>The second iteration of the UU mafia saw some changes to make the challenge a little easier. The mafia members had to form half of their teams from a bank of Pokemon used by team leaders in game and challengers only had to wait 48 hours between challenges, which was later changed to 24. Even with these adjustments, no user was able to conquer the band of elite UU players.</p>
