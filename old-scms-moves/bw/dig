[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user enters a semi-invulnerable state for the turn the move is used. The next turn, the user exits that state and deals damage to the target.  If the move is prevented from being used after the user has entered the semi-invulnerable state, then the entire move is canceled, but PP is still deducted. The user cannot make a move between turns. The user can still be hit by Earthquake and Magnitude, which will hit for double the usual damage, while in the semi-invulnerable state, or if it was previously targeted by Mind Reader or Lock-On, or if the opponent has No Guard. If the user holds the item Power Herb, the move will not enter the semi-invulnerable state and simply deal damage to the target that turn. The user does not take sandstorm or hail damage while it is in the semi-invulnerable state. This move also has an in-game effect that lets the player return to the entrance of a cave or dungeon when it is used by one of their Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Dig is a two-turn move that is not seen in the competitive scene for several reasons; the first is the existence of Earthquake, a 100 Base Power move with perfect accuracy and no drawbacks. Combine this with the fact that Dig, as already said, takes two turns to work, and it becomes clear that Dig is absolutely outclassed. While on the charge-up turn, nothing stops your opponent to simply switching out to a Pokemon that either resists the move or is even immune to it. In a competitive environment, giving your opponent free turns should be avoided at all costs. For everything stated, there are better options for a Ground-type moveslot. The only time you'll see it is where the user cannot learn Earthquake, such as Ninjask.</p>
