Overview########Zapdos has some very nice toys that make it a great defensive check to several threats. The first is reliable recovery in the form of Roost, which really sets it apart from Rotom-W. The second is its solid bulk which, coupled with a nifty defensive typing, allows Zapdos to check some of the tier's most dangerous threats such as Aegislash, Mega Pinsir, and Scizor. Finally, Zapdos gets Defog, and it is one of the best users of the move in OU. It can beat Bisharp, something no other Defogger can do except Mandibuzz, and is useful outside of Defog. Unfortunately, Zapdos is held back by a nasty SR weakness. Furthermore, the Thundurus formes, both of which boast strong Abilities and Nasty Plot to help muscle through walls, outclass Zapdos offensively. When using Zapdos be mindful of its limitations and play to its strengths.Defensive########name: Defensivemove 1: Thunderboltmove 2: Roostmove 3: Defogmove 4: Heat Wave / Toxic / U-turnability: Pressureitem:Leftoversevs: 248 HP / 244 Def /16 Spenature: BoldMoves========Thunderbolt is Zapdos's best STAB option, packing respectable power off of its base 125 Special Attack and 100% accuracy. Discharge is also an option for the high paralysis chance, but the drop in power is noticeable, failing to OHKO Mega Pinsir. Roost helps keep Zapdos alive and mitigates its weakness to Stealth Rock. Defog lets Zapdos keep any hazards off of the field. Heat Wave is the best option in the last spot to hit Steel-types like Scizor, Bisharp, and Ferrothorn very hard. Toxic can be used to wear down common switch-ins like Landorus-T, while U-turn can help Zapdos pivot on predicted switches.Set Details========The EVs and Bold nature are designed to maximize physical bulk while still outspeeding neutral-natured base 70 Pokemon such as Bisharp and Breloom. 248 HP EVs lower Stealth Rock damage. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 64 Def / 180 SpD / 16 Spe is also good, allowing Zapdos to still counter Mega Pinsir while also taking on special threats like Thundurus and Landorus. Leftovers is the best item to improve longevity, but Rocky Helmet can also be used to punish physical attackers.Usage Tips========Try not to switch Zapdos into Stealth Rock too much without using Roost in between, because while it does lose momentum, Zapdos can be worn down by hazards quickly. When SR is on the field, don't use Zapdos to handle things that will probably just U-turn out like Scizor; Zapdos will get worn down quickly if you do. Instead, save Zapdos for your opponent's sweepers that you couldn't otherwise handle, like Mega Pinsir and Lucario. Try to keep Zapdos away from status because it hurts its longevity, especially Toxic. In general, try to keep SR off the field as much as possible. Zapdos scares off many SR users in the metagame, and you should utilize the free turn you get as the opponent switches to their counter to use Defog.Team Options========Physical Fighting types are good teammates for Zapdos as they can scare away or set up on the Tyranitars and Chanseys that like to switch in on Zapdos. Terrakion is a particularly good choice since Zapdos handles two of its strongest checks, Scizor and Aegislash, exceptionally well. Cleric Support from the likes of Sylveon, Clefable and Chansey is also nice to alleviate Zapdos's status woes.Other Options########Zapdos has several other options for sets. Substitute and Roost used to be a popular set on Zapdos, but it has trouble being very effective. Zapdos also gets Agility and Baton Pass, but Scollipede does it better. Zapdos can go offensive with a set of Thunderbolt / Heat Wave / Hidden Power Ice / Roost, but Thundurus packs more of a punch. It gets Rain Dance, which can be used on a rain team along with a powerful Thunder.Checks & Counters########**Stealth Rock**: Making sure Stealth Rock stays on the field is the easiest way to deal with Zapdos. Good Stealth Rock users include Terrakion, Tyranitar, and Landorus-T, since all of them can force Zapdos out.**Special Walls**: Zapdos doesnt have the firepower to get past dedicated special walls such as Chansey and Mega Venusaur. Tyranitar and Hippowdon can handle also wall Zapdos if it lacks Toxic and the former threatens it with Rock-type STAB.**Dragons**: Many of them, such as Dragonite, Kyurem-B, Mega Charizard X, and Latios can set up on or do major damage to Zapdos.**Set up Sweepers**: If Zapdos doesn't have toxic, it becomes setup bait for Terakion, Volcarona, Thundurus-T, and Calm Mind users.**Boosted STAB attacks**: Even fully invested, Zapdos doesn't have the bulk to take some of the metagame's stronger attacks like Specs Draco Meteors from Latios or Banded Talonflame's Flare Blitz.**Rock- and Ice-types**: Pokemon like Kyurem-B, Mamoswine, Terrakion, and Tyranitar can all take Zapdos out with relative ease.
