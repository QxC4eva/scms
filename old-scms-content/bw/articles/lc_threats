<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/63.png" alt="Abra" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/abra"><strong>Abra</strong></a><br />
Type: Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 25 HP / 20 Atk / 15 Def / 105 SpA / 55 SpD / 90 Spe<br />
Ability: Synchronize / Inner Focus / Magic Guard</p>

<p>With base 25 HP and base 15 Defense, Abra wasn't exactly a staple in past generations. In BW, however, Abra has risen in usage since the release of its Dream World ability: Magic Guard. Immunity to all forms of passive damage, such as entry hazard damage, Life Orb recoil, and weather damage makes Abra a very reliable revenge killer when equipped with Focus Sash. It can also utilize Life Orb, with its fantastic Special Attack and Speed, as well as its extensive movepool making it a very strong sweeper. Although it may not take damage from hazards or weather, Abra will pretty much lose to any physical attack, especially super effective ones, due to its low physical bulk.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/640.png" alt="Axew" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/axew"><strong>Axew</strong></a><br />
Type: Dragon<br />
Base Stats: 46 HP / 87 Atk / 60 Def / 30 SpA / 40 SpD / 57 Spe<br />
Ability: Rivalry / Mold Breaker / Unnerve (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Axew has the highest base Attack out of all the Dragon-type Pokemon in LC. Even though it has a shallow movepool, it does receive two exceptional moves: Dragon Dance and Outrage. Due to its high Attack, Axew can also utilize a Choice Scarf set to eliminate any threats quickly. Rivalry increases Axew's Attack when it encounters foes of the opposite gender, while Mold Breaker renders many abilities, such as Sturdy and Levitate, useless before Axew's power. However, even such strengths come with their drawbacks. Axew's flimsy defenses aren't the best; therefore, it can be easily taken down.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/441.png" alt="Bronzor" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/bronzor"><strong>Bronzor</strong></a><br />
Type: Steel / Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 57 HP / 24 Atk / 86 Def / 24 SpA / 86 SpD / 23 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate / Heatproof / Heavy Metal</p>

<p>Bronzor is one of the most capable defensive Pokemon in Little Cup. Its excellent defensive stats combine perfectly with a support movepool, including moves such as Stealth Rock, Light Screen, and Reflect, enabling Bronzor to fill many roles on a team. Two excellent abilities in Levitate and Heatproof let it mitigate one of its weaknesses, giving it an immunity or a neutrality to one of two common attacking types. While its Attack stat may not be all that impressive, beware of attempting to set up on Bronzor, as it can easily Gyro Ball boosting sweepers.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/170.png" alt="Chinchou" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/chinchou"><strong>Chinchou</strong></a><br />
Type: Water / Electric<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 38 Atk / 38 Def / 56 SpA / 56 SpD / 67 Spe<br />
Ability: Illuminate / Volt Absorb / Water Absorb</p>

<p>The generation shift didn't bring Chinchou many changes; as in DPP, Chinchou still makes a great Choice Scarf user, with access to moves such as Hydro Pump, Surf, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam. A new addition that works greatly with Choice Scarf is the move Volt Switch, which bestows upon Chinchou fantastic scouting capabilities. It can also run a Life Orb sweeping set with three of the aforementioned moves, using Agility to hit 32 Speed. With access to moves such as Thunder Wave, Confuse Ray, Scald, and Heal Bell, Chinchou can also play a supportive role in teams. Thunder Wave is exceptionally useful, as it cripples opponents, especially the faster sweepers in today's metagame. Those Pokemon that are immune to Thunder Wave may instead be hit by a super effective Scald, which too can cripple sweepers by burning them and halving their Attack.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/366.png" alt="Clamperl" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/clamperl"><strong>Clamperl</strong></a><br />
Type: Water<br />
Base Stats: 35 HP / 64 Atk / 85 Def / 74 SpA / 55 SpD / 32 Spe<br />
Ability: Shell Armor / Rattled</p>

<p>Clamperl received a major boost this generation in the form of Shell Smash. Shell Smash and DeepSeaTooth together can skyrocket Clamperl's Special Attack to a massive 68, and also allow it to outspeed the vast majority of the tier. Surf and Ice Beam are staples on Clamperl, and the last slot is usually reserved for its choice of Hidden Power; Hidden Power Electric hits Water-types such as Slowpoke, Mantyke, and Tentacool super effectively, while Hidden Power Fire easily KOes Ferroseed, which shrugs off any of Clamperl's other attacks. Clamperl can also run Hidden Power Grass to hit bulkier variants of Eviolite Chinchou, while still hitting most other Water-types for super effective damage.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/574.png" alt="Cottonee" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/cottonee"><strong>Cottonee</strong></a><br />
Type: Grass<br />
Base Stats: 40 HP / 27 Atk / 60 Def / 37 SpA / 50 SpD / 66 Spe<br />
Ability: Prankster / Infiltrator / Chlorophyll (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Cottonee is predictable, yet incredibly hard to stop. Due to its Prankster ability, it gains priority on Substitute, Encore, and Leech Seed, which allows it to Leech Seed stall almost any Pokemon with a higher HP stat than it. It also doubles as a great stop to set up Pokemon with its priority Encore. Cottonee can also run a variety of other moves such as Cotton Guard, Stun Spore, or Taunt to increase its defensive capabilities or support its team. It is generally seen with Leftovers for more recovery, or Eviolite to buff its defenses. With entry hazard support, Cottonee can pick apart unprepared teams.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/458.png" alt="Croagunk" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/croagunk"><strong>Croagunk</strong></a><br />
Typing: Poison / Fighting<br />
Base Stats: 48 HP / 61 Atk / 40 Def / 61 SpA / 40 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Ability: Anticipation / Dry Skin / Poison Touch</p>

<p>While this poison frog may appear to be no more than yet another Fighting-type in a tier packed full of it's brethren, it possesses some key characteristics that separate it from the pack, most importantly, its access to an abundance of priority attacks. With a trio of priority attacks in Sucker Punch, Fake Out, and Vacuum Wave coming off of perfectly usable base 61 attacking stats, Croagunk has the ability to come in on many threats and stop their sweep. Croagunk's unique typing also allows it to make a good check to most other Fighting-types, being able to Bulk Up against them and hit them with a powerful Drain Punch. It also has Payback or Dark Pulse for Gastly and Wynaut that think they can switch in and have their way with Croagunk.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/50.png" alt="Diglett" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/diglett"><strong>Diglett</strong></a><br />
Type: Ground<br />
Base Stats: 10 HP / 55 Atk / 25 Def / 35 SpA / 45 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Ability: Arena Trap / Sand Veil / Sand Force (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Diglett is used in Little Cup for one reason only: Arena Trap. This unique ability allows Diglett to switch in after a KO or on one of the many Electric-type attacks thrown around, trapping a helpless opponent, outspeeding it, and KOing it. In addition, if Diglett switches in on a foe Choice-locked into an Electric-type attack, Diglett can set up with Substitute and Hone Claws to raise its Attack to massive levels before sweeping. However, its poor defensive stats mean that Diglett is worn down easily, especially by repeated Fake Outs or Mach Punches, but a careful Diglett user can cause serious damage to a team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/84.png" alt="Doduo" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/doduo"><strong>Doduo</strong></a><br />
Type: Normal / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 35 HP / 85 Atk / 45 Def / 35 SpA / 35 SpD / 75 Spe<br />
Ability: Run Away / Early Bird / Tangled Feet</p>

<p>Doduo is often compared to the more common Normal / Flying-type Taillow, and for good reason. The two are almost completely identical in set and playstyle. The notable differences between the two is that Doduo has a higher Attack stat, giving it 3 extra Attack points at the cost of 1 Speed point. It also lacks U-turn, a huge plus for Taillow. Doduo (and Taillow) most commonly runs a Choice Scarf set, allowing it to revenge kill boosting sweepers such as Scraggy and Clamperl, as well as threaten all of the Fighting-types in the tier with powerful Brave Birds. Doduo has a fairly shallow movepool, so it usually rounds out the set with Return, as well as some combination of Double Hit, Quick Attack, Pursuit, and Drill Peck.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/430.png" alt="Drifloon" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/drifloon"><strong>Drifloon</strong></a><br />
Type: Ghost / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 50 Atk / 34 Def / 60 SpA / 44 SpD / 70 Spe<br />
Ability: Aftermath / Unburden / Flare Boost</p>

<p>The ability to utilize Unburden along with Acrobatics makes Drifloon an interesting sweeper in Little Cup. Boosted by Flying Gem and the effect of Acrobatics, Drifloon's initial Acrobatics reaches a frighteningly high Base Power. Moreover, Unburden doubles its Speed after Drifloon has consumed the Flying Gem, allowing it to reach a Speed of 32. That is not all, however. Drifloon can opt to use a Calm Mind and Oran Berry set. As many of Drifloon's weaknesses are mostly special attacks, it can boost its Special Defense with Calm Mind to tank those attacks, and, once Oran Berry activates, Drifloon can smack the opponent with a boosted Special Attack and high Speed. Drifloon can also use Substitute or Destiny Bond to get out of sticky situations against Sucker Punch users, its biggest weakness.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/557.png" alt="Drilbur" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/drilbur"><strong>Drilbur</strong></a><br />
Type: Ground<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 85 Atk / 40 Def / 30 SpA / 45 SpD / 68 Spe<br />
Ability: Sand Rush / Sand Force / Mold Breaker (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Drilbur pretty much fills the same role as its evolution, Excadrill, did in OU. It needs Hippopotas to be effective, but when in sandstorm, Drilbur is an absolute monster. Base 85 Attack possibly further boosted by Swords Dance makes it amazingly powerful, and when coupled with essentially a 32 Speed stat in sand, Drilbur is one of the most potent sweepers in LC. Sand Rush allows Drilbur to outspeed every single LC Pokemon, even should they be holding a Choice Scarf, making priority moves the only reliable way to revenge kill Drilbur. After a Swords Dance boost, Drilbur has an equally impressive Attack stat of 38, allowing it to make mincemeat out of most switch-ins, especially with entry hazards support. The only thing actually holding Drilbur back is its weak movepool, which comprises of only Earthquake, Rock Slide, X-Scissor, and Frustration / Return.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/587.png" alt="Dwebble" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/dwebble"><strong>Dwebble</strong></a><br />
Type: Bug / Rock<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 65 Atk / 85 Def / 35 SpA / 35 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Ability: Sturdy / Shell Armor / Weak Armor (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Dwebble, unlike many Pokemon in LC, is a one-trick pony. With Sturdy and 16 Speed, Dwebble can almost guarantee Stealth Rock and at least one layer of Spikes. Additional moves usually include Rock Blast, Earthquake, X-Scissor, and Toxic; Rock Blast and Toxic are especially dangerous for Pokemon that try to take the opportunity to set up Substitute, such as Gastly; or Swords Dance, such as Drilbur, respectively. Dwebble can also run a potent Shell Smash set, as with Sturdy it will almost always be guaranteed a Shell Smash.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/102.png" alt="Exeggcute" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/exeggcute"><strong>Exeggcute</strong></a><br />
Type: Grass / Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 40 Atk / 80 Def / 60 SpA / 45 SpD / 40 Spe<br />
Ability: Chlorophyll / Harvest</p>

<p>Exeggcute is known for being able to tear apart whole teams in Little Cup using the combination of Substitute, Oran Berry, and Harvest. Its ability to comfortably switch into Staryu's and Chinchou's attacks is an immense advantage it boasts, and its excellent overall stats help it play any role well. Moves such as Sleep Powder, Leaf Storm, Leech Seed, and Psychic enable Exeggcute to be a sweeper, team supporter, and staller all at the same time. In addition to this powerful set, Exeggcute has access to Chlorophyll to make it a massive threat in sun.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/627.png" alt="Ferroseed" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/ferroseed"><strong>Ferroseed</strong></a><br />
Type: Grass / Steel<br />
Base Stats: 44 HP / 50 Atk / 91 Def / 24 SpA / 86 SpD / 10 Spe<br />
Ability: Iron Barbs</p>

This is everything Pineco wishes it could be. Ferroseed's unique typing and good bulk allows it to switch into many threatening Pokemon and set up Stealth Rock or Spikes, as well as spam annoying status moves such as Leech Seed and Thunder Wave. Ferroseed usually runs Protect to help scout Choice Pokemon, and to gain another turn of Leech Seed damage. In addition, Ferroseed can rack up damage with its ability Iron Barbs, further wearing down Pokemon that utilize contact moves against it. It also has enough attack to threaten opposing Pokemon with STAB Bullet Seed, Seed Bomb, or Gyro Ball.

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/622.png" alt="Frillish" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/frillish"><strong>Frillish</strong></a><br />
Type: Water / Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 40 Atk / 50 Def / 65 SpA / 85 SpD / 40 Spe<br />
Ability: Water Absorb / Cursed Body / Damp (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Much like Jellicent in OU, Frillish makes a fantastic bulky Water-type. Frillish is very capable of walling some of the metagame's most powerful offensive threats, thanks to its great defensive typing and access to helpful support and defensive moves in Will-O-Wisp, Recover, Scald, Toxic, and Taunt. Eviolite boosts its already excellent Special Defense, and also helps to bring its mediocre Defense to a respectable level. This, combined with Frillish's ability to spread burns, allows it to take on many of the physically oriented Fighting-types in the metagame. Furthermore, it has STAB Surf and Shadow Ball, as well as coverage moves such as Energy Ball and Ice Beam to hit a variety of common Pokemon hard.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/92.png" alt="Gastly" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/gastly"><strong>Gastly</strong></a><br />
Type: Ghost / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 30 HP / 35 Atk / 30 Def / 100 SpA / 35 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Gastly is much like Gengar in OU. The pre-evolution boasts one of the highest Special Attack stats in the tier and is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier at 18 Speed, both of which make it very threatening. Gastly commonly runs both Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb in LC, as Steel-types aren't very prevalent, and also runs Hidden Power Fighting for Munchlax, Dark-types, and the few Steel-types that do show up such as Pawniard and Ferroseed. It also commonly runs a set with Substitute and Hypnosis to shut down the opponent's counter, with either Eviolite, Life Orb, or Oran Berry as its hold item. In addition, it can run a good TrickScarf set, capable of both revenge killing most of the metagame and also providing setup opportunities to its teammates via Trick.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/454.png" alt="Hippopotas" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/hippopotas"><strong>Hippopotas</strong></a><br />
Type: Ground<br />
Base Stats: 68 HP / 72 Atk / 78 Def / 38 SpA / 42 SpD / 32 Spe<br />
Ability: Sand Stream / Sand Force</p>

<p>Hippopotas is unique among LC Pokemon, as it summons permanent sand upon switching in. While it can be useful for many kinds of teams, its great bulk and support movepool serve to make it an especially good fit for stall teams. Hippopotas has access to Stealth Rock, vital to any stall team, and is able to Roar enemies away, racking up hazard damage. It also has the all-important Slack Off that grants it instant and reliable recovery, which makes it difficult for any physical attacker to break through. Last but not least, the sand also boosts Pokemon, most notably Drilbur, opening the door for sand sweepers to wreak havoc. Hippopotas's greatest strength isn't its own power, but the support it provides for its team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/228.png" alt="Houndour" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/houndour"><strong>Houndour</strong></a><br />
Type: Dark / Fire<br />
Base Stats: 45 HP / 60 Atk / 30 Def / 80 SpA / 50 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Ability: Early Bird / Flash Fire / Unnerve</p>

<p>Houndour is one of the premier mixed sweepers in Little Cup, and for good reason. Its mixed attacking and Speed stats are absolutely fantastic; for instance, it can Speed tie Mienfoo and KO with Fire Blast after Spikes damage. A Life Orb will make Houndour incredibly powerful, but Choice items are excellent as well. Houndour also enjoys superb dual STAB, which let it hit every Pokemon in Little Cup for at least neutral damage, bar other Houndour. It also gets a priority attack in Sucker Punch, which allows it to pick off weakened faster threats such as Taillow. Additionally, Houndour can boost its Speed with Flame Charge, if Speed tying with Mienfoo and being outpaced by Gastly are turn-offs. Though Stealth Rock rips off a quarter of its HP every time it switches in, Houndour can still cause a lot of havoc on the battlefield.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/666.png" alt="Larvesta" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/larvesta"><strong>Larvesta</strong></a><br />
Type: Bug / Fire<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 85 Atk / 55 Def / 50 SpA / 55 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Ability: Flame Body / Swarm (Unreleased)</p>

<p>With its high Attack, good Speed, and unique typing, Larvesta is one for every team to consider. Great offensive typing that hits most of the tier for neutral coverage, as well as great bulk with Eviolite, sets Larvesta apart from the pack, allowing it to function as a bulky check to many of the tier's threats and also pose a massive offensive threat. Flame Body is a fantastic ability for a bulky attacker such as Larvesta, allowing it to tank and burn physical attackers such as Mienfoo, recovering off any damage with Morning Sun. Larvesta isn't just a one-trick pony either; it can even run a destructive Choice Scarf or Choice Band set to revenge kill most of the tier, or absolutely murder whatever is sad enough to switch in with its powerful STAB Flare Blitz and U-turn. Stealth Rock can be quite a pain for Larvesta, as it loses half of its health per switch in, but that is rarely enough to keep Larvesta from destroying much of the LC metagame.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/345.png" alt="Lileep" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/lileep"><strong>Lileep</strong></a><br />
Type: Rock / Grass<br />
Base Stats: 66 HP / 41 Atk / 77 Def / 61 SpA / 87 SpD / 23 Spe<br />
Ability: Suction Cups / Storm Drain</p>

<p>Lileep is a stalling machine. Its defensive stats are phenomenal, and they are only further buffed by Eviolite and sandstorm. Access to great boosting moves in Curse and Stockpile also increase its ability to wall your team if left unchecked. Its Storm Drain ability allows it to switch in on Water-type attacks with ease, and it has the all-important Recover to regain health. Lileep usually runs either a boosting set with Curse or Stockpile, allowing it to stat up and potentially sweep or stall out a team with its STAB attacks Rock Slide and Seed Bomb, or a more general defensive set, with which it can tank hits and spread Toxic damage. Lileep may also be seen using Substitute to block status, and generally works best on a sandstorm team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/81.png" alt="Magnemite" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/magnemite"><strong>Magnemite</strong></a><br />
Type: Electric / Steel<br />
Base Stats: 25 HP / 35 Atk / 70 Def / 95 SpA / 55 SpD / 45 Spe<br />
Ability: Magnet Pull / Sturdy / Analytic</p>

<p>Magnemite's niche in LC is its ability to trap and remove Steel-types from the match with Magnet Pull and its powerful special attacks. While Magnemite's movepool is fairly limited, it is just diverse enough to grant it the utility it needs. It can run a Substitute attacking set, Magnet Rise, Light Screen and Reflect, Volt Switch, and many other useful moves. Magnemite commonly runs either Choice Scarf or Life Orb to boost its Speed or Special Attack. It is a threat to watch out for if you run Steel-types, as Magnemite has little problem dealing with most of them.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/649.png" alt="Mienfoo" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/mienfoo"><strong>Mienfoo</strong></a><br />
Type: Fighting<br />
Base Stats: 45 HP / 85 Atk / 50 Def / 55 SpA / 50 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Ability: Inner Focus / Regeneration / Reckless (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Mienfoo is a unique Pokemon in LC, as it has great offensive capabilities along with access to the ability Regenerator. Regenerator allows Mienfoo to recover 1/3 of its total HP upon switching out, and with access to U-turn and Fake Out, this can be used effectively not only for scouting, but for self-healing, and racking up tons of residual damage. Although it is frail, Mienfoo's impressive base 85 Attack and average 17 Speed enable it to run a potent Choice Scarf set as well. Mienfoo is also one of two Fighting-type Pokemon in LC that has access to Swords Dance, allowing it to function as an excellent Life Orb sweeper, with moves such as Hi Jump Kick, Stone Edge, U-turn, and Payback.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/200.png" alt="Misdreavus" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/misdreavus"><strong>Misdreavus</strong></a><br />
Type: Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 60 Atk / 60 Def / 85 SpA / 85 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>One of the strongest Pokemon offensively and defensively in Little Cup, it is no surprise that Misdreavus is the most common Rapid Spin blocker and Ghost-type in general. Misdreavus has fantastic typing, which grants it three immunities. Furthermore, it can sweep through teams with Nasty Plot and great two move coverage in Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting. Misdreavus has a plethora of other options, including Will-O-Wisp, Substitute, and Pain Split. Misdreavus is also one of the most effective Choice Scarf users in the metagame, due to its natural bulk and ability to revenge kill devastating Pokemon such as opposing Misdreavus with Shadow Ball (or even Destiny Bond).</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/451.png" alt="Munchlax" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/munchlax"><strong>Munchlax</strong></a><br />
Type: Normal<br />
Base Stats: 135 HP / 85 Atk / 40 Def / 40 SpA / 85 SpD / 5 Spe<br />
Ability: Thick Fat / Immunity / Gluttony (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Munchlax is the premier special wall in LC, and for good reason; its amazing bulk allows it to sponge hits from almost any special attacker and respond with a powerful attack of its own. Eviolite only increases its potential, patching up its inferior Defense and boosting its great Special Defense. Munchlax has access to a variety of useful moves that complement its stats almost perfectly: Curse boosts its average Defense and turns it into a massive threat, Stockpile makes it near-impossible to take down, and Whirlwind allows it to act as a phazer. Also outstanding is Munchlax's offensive movepool, which includes moves such as Return, Earthquake, Crunch, Ice Punch, Fire Punch, and Pursuit.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/198.png" alt="Murkrow" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/murkrow"><strong>Murkrow</strong></a><br />
Type: Dark / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 85 Atk / 42 Def / 85 SpA / 42 SpD / 91 Spe<br />
Ability: Insomnia / Super Luck / Prankster</p>

<p>Boasting some of the highest attacking stats in Little Cup, Murkrow is a deadly threat to every team. Notably, it has two extremely strong STABS that decimate many Pokemon of the tier backed by fantastic mixed stats. Murkrow has Sucker Punch, Brave Bird, Drill Peck, Icy Wind, and even Heat Wave in its movepool, meaning it can 2HKO most things in the tier while outspeeding them as well. The best way to take it down is to make the most of its frailty; if Murkrow opts for Life Orb, it will be worn out rather quickly in conjunction with its weakness to Stealth Rock. Furthermore, Murkrow gained Prankster through the Dream World, meaning it can make the most of its fantastic support movepool, which includes Substitute, Roost, Calm Mind, FeatherDance, Thunder Wave, and even Perish Song. Murkrow commonly runs  a mixed attacking set with Heat Wave to take out Steel-types, a Substitute and Roost set, or a defensive set with Eviolite and support moves; all must be handled differently.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/177.png" alt="Natu" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/natu"><strong>Natu</strong></a><br />
Type: Psychic / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 40 HP / 50 Atk / 45 Def / 70 SpA / 45 SpD / 70 Spe<br />
Ability: Synchronize / Early Bird / Magic Bounce</p>

<p>Natu's greatest draw is its ability, Magic Bounce, with which it can bounce back non-attacking moves, such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, Taunt, phazing moves, and status-inflicting moves; this enables it to effectively break apart most stall. Natu also has an incredibly varied supporting movepool, which can benefit just about every team. Its moves include Thunder Wave, Reflect, Light Screen, Wish, FeatherDance, and Trick, although the last is illegal with Magic Bounce. Despite its mediocre defenses, Natu can contribute some valuable resistances. It has a 4x resistance to Fighting-type moves and immunities to both Ground-type and status moves, which means that, given the right prediction, Natu has ample opportunities to switch in and provide support for the team. Natu also boosts an impressive base 70 Special Attack, and coupled with its decent 17 maximum Speed stat, Natu can also be a potent Choice user.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/138.png" alt="Omanyte" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/omanyte"><strong>Omanyte</strong></a><br />
Type: Water / Rock<br />
Base Stats: 35 HP / 40 Atk / 100 Def / 90 SpA / 55 SpD / 35 Spe<br />
Ability: Swift Swim / Shell Armor / Weak Armor</p>

<p>Omanyte has become a forgotten wonder with time. BW, however, introduced the move Shell Smash and with it gave Omanyte a new lease on life. With a well above average base 90 Special Attack and large movepool, Omanyte becomes a very threatening sweeper few teams are prepared for. Its base 100 Defense also lets it take physical moves excellently, which gives it many opportunities to set up Shell Smash and tear teams apart. With key resistances, such as to Fire-type attacks, as well as Eviolite boosting its already respectable defenses, it makes a solid wall. Additionally, Omanyte has access to all three types of hazards: Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/654.png" alt="Pawniard" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/pawniard"><strong>Pawniard</strong></a><br />
Type: Dark / Steel<br />
Base Stats: 45 HP / 85 Atk / 70 Def / 40 SpA / 40 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Ability: Defiant / Inner Focus / Pressure (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Pawniard reaches a respectable maximum Speed of 16 and sky-high Attack of 19. It receives Swords Dance, and has two very useful STAB moves: Sucker Punch and Iron Head. The former is a very threatening priority move, especially after STAB and a Swords Dance boost, and Iron Head has a chance of flinching slower opponents to death. Pawniard also has Brick Break to hit opposing Steel-types, and Night Slash and Pursuit as other Dark-type STAB choices. Pawniard has a good range of support moves such as Stealth Rock, Taunt, Thunder Wave, and Toxic. Lastly, while its typing may give it numerous weaknesses, it has many handy resistances it can take advantage of to set up on.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/77.png" alt="Ponyta" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/ponyta"><strong>Ponyta</strong></a><br />
Type: Fire<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 85 Atk / 55 Def / 65 SpA / 65 SpD / 90 Spe<br />
Ability: Run Away / Flash Fire / Flame Body</p>

<p>Ponyta's high base 90 Speed, base 85 Attack, and superb movepool speaks for itself: peaking at 19 Speed, Ponyta is one of the fastest Pokemon in the LC metagame, outspeeding threatening Pokemon such as Gastly and Mienfoo. Equipped with a Life Orb, it becomes a hard-hitting sweeper. Ponyta's main attack is Flare Blitz, which can be boosted by Flash Fire to make it even more stronger. Wild Charge lets Ponyta defeat the Water-types that switch into it, and Return rounds off the set, giving it excellent neutral coverage. Ponyta also receives recovery in Morning Sun, which lets it regain health lost to Life Orb, Flare Blitz, or Wild Charge recoil. However, as Ponyta is weak to Stealth Rock and loses a significant portion of its HP each time it switches in, Rapid Spin support is recommended.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/589.png" alt="Scraggy" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/scraggy"><strong>Scraggy</strong></a><br />
Type: Dark / Fighting<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 75 Atk / 70 Def / 35 SpA / 70 SpD / 48 Spe<br />
Ability: Shed Skin / Moxie / Intimidate (Unreleased)</p>

<p>With great typing, bulk, and access to Dragon Dance to boost its already big Attack, Scraggy is one of the scariest Pokemon in Little Cup. Equipped with Eviolite, Scraggy can nab multiple Dragon Dances and easily sweep an under-prepared team. STAB Drain Punch provides Scraggy with a method of keeping its HP high enough to avoid being revenge killed, while Crunch offers great coverage and also enjoys a STAB boost. Furthermore, Scraggy has access to Zen Headbutt to KO Pokemon such as Croagunk, Timburr, and Koffing. Shed Skin allows Scraggy to safely set up against Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Slowpoke, which would otherwise cripple Scraggy with status attacks. More offensive versions of Dragon Dance Scraggy are also effective. Scraggy can use Life Orb and Hi Jump Kick for insane amounts of power after a single Dragon Dance, and Moxie to increase its Attack further after every KO. In addition to Dragon Dance, Scraggy gets access to other stat boosting moves in Bulk Up and Amnesia, which in tandem with Shed Skin make RestTalk sets very threatening when used correctly.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/90.png" alt="Shellder" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/shellder"><strong>Shellder</strong></a><br />
Type: Water<br />
Base Stats: 30 HP / 65 Atk / 100 Def / 45 SpA / 25 SpD / 40 Spe<br />
Ability: Shell Armor / Skill Link / Overcoat</p>

<p>With Skill Link and Shell Smash, Shellder can become a very powerful offensive threat in just one turn by boosting its already impressive base 65 Attack, as well as its usable base 40 Speed. Both Rock Blast and Icicle Spear got buffed in the generation shift, and together, they give Shellder essentially two 125 Base Power attacks to abuse. Shellder also has a new toy in Shell Blade, which rounds out its coverage fairly nicely, and lastly, it receives Ice Shard to beat frail priority users and Choice Scarf revenge killers.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/646.png" alt="Shelmet" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/shelmet"><strong>Shelmet</strong></a><br />
Type: Bug<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 40 Atk / 85 Def / 40 SpA / 65 SpD / 25 Spe<br />
Ability: Hydration / Shell Armor / Overcoat (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Although its typing and stat spread may let Shelmet down in some instances, they also let it capitalize on its strengths, making it a very capable support Pokemon in LC. Its support movepool is nothing to scoff at either; in fact, it's actually fantastic for what Shelmet wants to do. These factors make Shelmet a rather one-dimensional Pokemon, but it's still very effective. 50 / 85 / 65 defenses make it a great defensive Pokemon overall, and even enable it to check powerful Pokemon such as Timburr without Stone Edge and Scraggy. Shelmet's movepool, which includes options such as Recover, Spikes, Encore, Acid Armor, and Yawn, further supplements it in its role as a defensive supporter. Although rare, a fairly unique form of support it can provide is Baton Passing either Curse or Acid Armor to a teammate able to make good use of the boosts.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/79.png" alt="Slowpoke" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/slowpoke"><strong>Slowpoke</strong></a><br />
Type: Water / Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 65 Atk / 65 Def / 40 SpA / 40 SpD / 15 Spe<br />
Ability: Oblivious / Own Tempo / Regenerator</p>

<p>Slowpoke received many boosts this generation, making it a top Pokemon in Little Cup. The introduction of Eviolite gave Slowpoke a further boost to its already impressive defenses, allowing it to deal with many of Little Cup's top offensive threats, such as Mienfoo and Drilbur. Slowpoke also received the ability Regenerator from the Dream World, allowing it to shrug off damage from entry hazards and weather. While Slowpoke cannot use Aqua Tail with Regenerator, it still has a fairly deep support movepool with Slack Off, Thunder Wave, Toxic, Yawn, Scald, and Trick Room. In addition to its STAB attacks in Surf, Psychic, and Zen Headbutt, Slowpoke has access to great coverage moves in Earthquake, Fire Blast, and Ice Beam to hit many of its common switch-ins for super effective damage. Finally, Slowpoke can run a Calm Mind set to make itself a powerful and bulky threat.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/464.png" alt="Snover" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/snover"><strong>Snover</strong></a><br />
Typing: Grass / Ice<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 62 Atk / 50 Def / 62 SpA / 60 SpD / 40 Spe<br />
Ability: Snow Warning / Soundproof (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Behold the ice tree of Little Cup. Much like its big brother Abomasnow, Snover is most notable for its ability, Snow Warning; this fantastic ability allows Snover to switch in and instantly activate a hailstorm. Snover can take on many roles, such as a stall-oriented lead with Leech Seed, an all-out attacking one, a Swords Dance sweeper, a lure set, and even a Choice Scarf user, taking advantage of hail removing the Speed boosts of Sand Rush, Swift Swim, and Chlorophyll Pokemon. Combined with Snover's access to STAB Ice Shard, Blizzard, and Giga Drain, it should come as no surprise that Snover its a highly viable threat that can find a place on any team that fears weather, or just wants a powerful stalling force.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/120.png" alt="Staryu" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/staryu"><strong>Staryu</strong></a><br />
Type: Water<br />
Stats: 30 HP / 45 Atk / 55 Def / 70 SpA / 55 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Natural Cure / Illuminate / Analytic</p>

<p>Staryu is most commonly seen holding an Eviolite to boost its defenses, as with Recover Staryu can check the likes of Gastly and Bronzor without taking excessive damage. STAB Hydro Pump deals massive amounts of damage to anything that does not resist it, and Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, or Hidden Power Fire are all options for coverage moves. Staryu is also the best user of Rapid Spin in Little Cup, as none of the Ghost-types in the tier can switch in and threaten Staryu. Alternatively, Staryu can also be seen holding a Life Orb or Choice Scarf to abuse its good Special Attack and excellent Speed, along with Hydro Pump's massive power. With Life Orb, Staryu can at least 2HKO most of the Little Cup metagame.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/439.png" alt="Stunky" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/stunky"><strong>Stunky</strong></a><br />
Type: Poison / Dark<br />
Base Stats: 63 HP / 63 Atk / 47 Def / 41 SpA / 41 SpD / 74 Spe<br />
Ability: Stench / Aftermath / Keen Eye</p>

<p>Stunky is definitely a notable force in Little Cup, and for good reason. Peaking at 18 Speed, it's one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier. Furthermore, not only does Stunky receive access to the strongest priority attack out there, Sucker Punch, it gets STAB on it too. Stunky is also one of the best counters to a significant and familiar threat in the metagame: Gastly; Stunky can take everything Gastly can throw at it and trap the ghost with Pursuit, or kill it right away with Crunch or Sucker Punch. A respectable base 63 Attack, as well as a decent Special Attack and access to Fire Blast to hit Steel-types, further makes Stunky an excellent sweeper.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/276.png" alt="Taillow" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/taillow"><strong>Taillow</strong></a><br />
Type: Normal / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 40 HP / 55 Atk / 30 Def / 30 SpA / 30 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Ability: Guts / Scrappy</p>

<p>Taillow, like Doduo, most commonly runs a Choice Scarf set abusing its powerful Brave Bird in order to check boosting sweepers such as Scraggy and Clamperl. It also has access to U-turn, allowing it to gain momentum early in the game, while wearing down its Steel-type checks, as well as Return, Quick Attack, and Pursuit. Taillow can also run a Toxic Orb instead of Choice Scarf, making it a powerful attacker instead of a revenge killer. It can then use Guts and Facade in combination with its 19 Speed to wreck almost everything that lacks Ghost, Rock or Steel typing.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/72.png" alt="Tentacool" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/tentacool"><strong>Tentacool</strong></a><br />
Type: Water / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 40 HP / 40 Atk / 35 Def / 50 SpA / 100 SpD / 70 Spe<br />
Ability: Clear Body / Liquid Ooze / Rain Dish</p>

<p>Tentacool is prominent in LC as the premier Toxic Spiker in the tier. Its great special bulk allows it to function as a wall as well, and Eviolite can patch up its low Defense. Additionally, Tentacool has access to a variety of useful support options that let it function fantastically on balanced and defensive teams. For starters, it has a Poison typing and access to Rapid Spin, which allow it to reliably clear the field of hazards. It also receives Knock Off, which can cripple many Pokemon switching in. Haze too can be useful in stopping setup sweepers. Lastly, Tentacool is often seen using Protect and Scald, so be wary of blindly switching in physical attackers.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/560.png" alt="Timburr" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/timbur"><strong>Timburr</strong></a><br />
Type: Fighting<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 80 Atk / 55 Def / 25 SpA / 35 SpD / 35 Spe<br />
Ability: Guts / Sheer Force / Iron Fist (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Timburr brings excellent bulk and Attack to any team, and while it isn't especially versatile, it's great at what it does. Bulk Up and Eviolite grant Timburr humongous physical bulk, allowing it to set up on many threats and plow through the opponent's team. Faster Pokemon do not cause much trouble for Timburr, for it has access to STAB Mach Punch, which becomes quite powerful after a Bulk Up or two. While setting up, Timburr can easily keep itself alive with its powerful STAB Drain Punch; status also doesn't bother Timburr because of Guts and its ability to heal itself with every attack. Rounding off the set with excellent coverage alongside Timburr's Fighting-type STAB moves; Payback gives Timburr the ability to dent Ghost- and bulky Psychic-types.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/659.png" alt="Vullaby" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/vullaby"><strong>Vullaby</strong></a><br />
Type: Dark / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 55 Atk / 75 Def / 45 SpA / 65 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Ability: Big Pecks / Overcoat / Weak Armor (Unreleased)</p>

<p>One glance at its stat spread should leave you in no doubt that a defensive set is exactly what Vullaby excels at. Those great defensive stats coupled with a perfectly suited movepool make Vullaby an incredibly effective mixed wall; moves such as Toxic, Taunt, Roost, and Knock Off make it a great annoyance at best, and downright impossible to kill at worst. A defensive behemoth isn't all Vullaby can be, though. It can also run a fairly effective Choice Scarf set, with moves such as Brave Bird, U-turn, Punishment, and Pluck, which allow it to revenge kill offensive threats such as Scraggy and Gastly, and give it the ability to scout for and rack up damage on potential counters with U-turn. Finally, while rarely used, Vullaby even has access to other cool moves such as Mean Look and Nasty Plot.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/360.png" alt="Wynaut" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/wynaut"><strong>Wynaut</strong></a><br />
Type: Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 23 Atk / 48 Def / 23 SpA / 48 SpD / 23 Spe<br />
Ability: Shadow Tag / Telepathy</p>

<p>Wynaut, like its older sibling Wobbuffet, is used solely to abuse Shadow Tag. Encore allows Wynaut to provide its teammates with setup opportunities, while the combination of Mirror Coat and Counter enables it to remove Choice Scarf Pokemon and most other sweepers from the match with ease. Wynaut can also use Tickle to lower a foe's Defense, enabling a strong STAB Pursuit user such as Stunky or Pawniard to trap and kill it, or use Destiny Bond to eliminate an extra Pokemon before it faints. Safeguard is an option to ensure safe set-up for its teammates when it has used Encore on a status move.</p>
