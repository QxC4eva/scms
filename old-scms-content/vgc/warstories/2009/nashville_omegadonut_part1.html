<h2>THURSDAY</h2>

<p>After my mom finally gave up trying to convince me NOT to drive 3100 miles to and from Nashville, IPL and I left with a truckload of snacks and, for some reason, a baby seat in the back. I had no idea what IPL was doing with a baby seat, but didn't listen to the nagging voice in my mind that told me something was up.</p>

<h2>FRIDAY</h2>

<div class="rightimg"><img src="/media/vgc/1.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Despite being stuck with a flat&mdash;no, shredded&mdash;tire in Tucumcari, New Mexico at 7:30 in the morning, I wasn't worried. I knew how to change a tire, I was just going to find the car jack and tire iron and put on the spare. No biggie. Except all I find in the truck are a wireless router and some beaten-up Dolce &amp; Gabbana sunglasses. One phone call to IPL's roommate later, we confirm that, no, we do not have tire-replacing tools on board.</p>

<p>Shit.</p>

<p>After half an hour of trying to find our position and explain it to the operator, we finally get a guy from Quality Tire &amp; Lube to come out and replace our shredded tire. For $200.</p>

<p>An hour later, we cross the Texas state line. And not ten minutes into Texas, I got pulled over by a Texas ranger who did a U-turn across a median to pursue us. I wasn't surprised&mdash;I was going 75 in a 70 mph zone, and I had heard that Texas rangers were notorious for cracking down on even minor speeding offenders. So I thought all would go well until this happened:</p>

<p>IPL: This isn't our truck.<br />
Me: *facepalm*<br />
IPL: It's my roommate's, her name is (something I forgot).<br />
Trooper: That name isn't what's on the insurance.<br />
IPL: Uh, I think that's her mom's name...<br />
Trooper: ...<br />
Me: ...<br />
Trooper: Sir, please step out of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The trooper interrogated us separately, probably so he could determine if our stories matched up.</p>

<div class="rightimg"><img src="/media/vgc/2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Me: We're, uh, going to a video game tournament.<br />
Trooper: What kind of video game?</p>

<p>No matter how comfortable I've gotten with being an "out-of-the-closet" Pokémon player, it's still tough explaining to a Texas ranger that you're driving 1500 miles to compete in a Pokémon tournament.</p>

<p>Anyway, it looked like we were in the clear, until the ranger looked in the back seat and said "Is that a BABY?!" Ultimately, the Texas ranger was satisfied that we were just crazy fans who were driving all the way to Nashville for a Pokémon tournament, and not entrepreneuring car thieves who ditched a baby a couple miles back. My girlfriend has an alternate theory, however:</p>

<p>"I think he just assumed that, since you had Arizona plates, you were traveling to Massachusetts to get gay married to your gay boyfriend.</p>

<p>Naturally, the baby seat was for the kid we were going to adopt when we got there.</p>

<p>My girlfriend's mom has a clinic in Amarillo, so when I called her to say we were passing through she treated us to Kabuki's&mdash;a Japanese restaurant that was delicious, if not very authentic (Filet mignon? In a Japanese restaurant?)</p>

<p>You can't tell from this picture, but I was too full and tired to drive. (IPL is on the left, I'm on the right.)</p>

<p><em>Awwwww.</em></p>

<p>For those of you wondering, we took turns driving and sleeping. I had hoped to get through Phoenix Wright: Trials and Tribulations through the trip, but I didn't even make it through the second case.</p>

<h2>SATURDAY</h2>

<p>We finally got internet access at a Denny's, so I gave FiveKRunner my number over PM, and he called us and said we could crash at his hotel. Then IPL reminded me we were still four hours from Nashville, so I didn't get to see FiveK, chalky, and tad38 until the tournament doors opened. Once we registered, though, we got to meet mattj, doctorboyfriend, and a few others (let me know if I forgot you).</p>

<p>FiveK and I had time to pull off a few hijinks:</p>
