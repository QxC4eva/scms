Confuses the foe.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Confuses the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>No matter how much those Zubat in Mt. Moon might make you think otherwise, your opponent will still get to attack you over 70% of the time after you use this move. Stick to other status-inducing moves. There are better alternatives out there, even for confusion. It's a highly unreliable move that induces an unreliable status. Not worth the moveslot.</p>
