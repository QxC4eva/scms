[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder ignores <a href="/bw/moves/reflect">Reflect</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/light_screen">Light Screen</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/safeguard">Safeguard</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/mist">Mist</a> when attacking the opponent. These effects can still be ended by an attack, such as <a href="/bw/moves/brick_break">Brick Break</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Most of the Pokemon that have access to Infiltrator have better options. <a href="/bw/pokemon/crobat">Crobat</a> might find it useful in offensive sets, but in the most common cases, <a href="/bw/pokemon/whimsicott">Whimsicott</a> would prefer <a href="/bw/abilities/prankster">Prankster</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/jumpluff">Jumpluff</a> isn't realistically ever going to face Safeguard, even if it wants to use <a href="/bw/moves/sleep_powder">Sleep Powder</a>. Reflect and Light Screen aren't massive worries, and it is usually more effective to just Brick Break them away.</p>
