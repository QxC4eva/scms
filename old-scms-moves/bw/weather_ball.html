<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The move changes type and power depending on the weather conditions present. In rain, it becomes a 100 Base Power Water-type attack.

In normal conditions, it becomes a 50 Base Power Normal-type attack. These attacks also get a power boost from the weather, if applicable.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This move is only useful on weather sweepers such as Victreebel, who can use Weather Ball for a more powerful coverage move than Hidden Power. Crown Raikou also has access to this move and can use it to great effect in rain as it provides good coverage alongside Raikou's STAB move. However, the common Weather Ball users only extends to Victreebel, Raikou, and Roserade as it has terrible distribution. Nonetheless, Weather Ball is a good coverage move on the aforementioned Pokemon when they are used on weather teams.</p>
