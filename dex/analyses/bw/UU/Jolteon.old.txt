[Overview]

<p>Like many other Pokemon this generation, Jolteon fell from OU and dropped into UU. Here, Jolteon finds itself competing with fellow Electric-types Zapdos and Raikou, who boast more bulk and better movepool options. However, Jolteon has some tricks of its own. With a base Speed of 130, Jolteon can outspeed almost every single non-boosted Pokemon in UU. Its base 110 Special Attack stat is nothing to scoff at, either, as it can deal severe damage when equipped with a Choice Specs or Life Orb. Jolteon also has nifty support options such as Baton Pass and Yawn, and can safely switch into Thunder Wave and other Electric-type moves with Volt Absorb. However, the electric critter is extremely frail and is easily knocked out even by neutral moves. A less-than-stellar offensive movepool also does it no favors. Despite these drawbacks, though, Jolteon's amazing sweeping and revenge-killing potentials are just too good to pass up.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Timid nature and Choice Specs equipped, Jolteon reaches 478 Special Attack and 394 Speed, which is more that enough to revenge kill almost every non-boosted Pokemon in UU. However, Jolteon is quite frail; therefore, it is recommended that you bring it into the field after a teammate has been KOed. Alternatively, one member on your team can bring Jolteon safely in by the use of moves such as U-turn, Baton Pass, or Volt Switch. With some prediction, you can even bring Jolteon on Electric-type moves or moves that deal neutral damage. However, any opponent worth his or her salt will try their best to get rid of Jolteon, so this latter option is easier said than done.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt is a very nice STAB move and, with Hidden Power Ice, hits many Pokemon for at least neutral damage. Hidden Power Ice also nails pesky Ground-type Pokemon, such as Flygon or Nidoking, on the switch. Shadow Ball is there simply because it is the only other reasonable coverage move Jolteon can use. It is a good way of dealing with Victini and other Psychic-types not weak to Thunderbolt. Shadow Ball also lets Jolteon hit the extremely rare Shedinja, who would otherwise wall it. The last move on this set, Volt Switch, is a very useful scouting move, and as a bonus, deals a bit of damage as well. However, Volt Switch will fail if your opponent brings in a Ground-type Pokemon, so predict carefully.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is quite simple. Jolteon should always run 252 Speed and a Timid nature in order to tie against other Pokemon with a base Speed of 130, such as Crobat and Aerodactyl. 252 Special Attack allows the electric rabbit to fry anything in its path. This EV spread is standard and should not be changed. What can be changed, though, are Jolteon's moves. Hidden Power Grass can go over Hidden Power Ice to hit threats such as Quagsire, who would otherwise wall Jolteon to no end. Baton Pass can be used over Volt Switch if you are scared of Ground-types switching in on Volt Switch and your opponent gaining a free turn.</p>

<p>Jolteon does not require any specific teammates in order to function perfectly. However, like all offensive Pokemon, entry hazard support is appreciated. Roserade is a good option for Spikes support, as it can use its STAB Grass-type attacks to remove any Ground-type Pokemon that may threaten Jolteon. Teammates that have good synergy with Jolteon are also recommended. Flygon, for example, can easily switch into any Ground-type moves aimed at Jolteon, and continue the cycle of scouting with U-turn. Flygon can also ward off any special walls that Jolteon has trouble with.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Using Life Orb over Choice Specs on Jolteon has many advantages. First of all, Jolteon is no longer locked into one move. This makes prediction easier, and enables Jolteon to act as both a revenge killer and a sweeper. Jolteon can also viably run support moves. However, Life Orb is not as powerful as Choice Specs, so Jolteon will need to rely on entry hazards to compensate for this. Like the Choice Specs set, Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice are chosen since they have great coverage, and Shadow Ball is a nifty coverage move. Charge Beam gives Jolteon a way to boost its Special Attack while revenge killing a weakened Pokemon. Substitute, though, can be used to shield Jolteon from priority attacks, and enables it to KO bulkier Pokemon. For example, Jolteon needs to use Hidden Power Ice twice to KO Nidoking, which would be impossible without Substitute shielding it from Nidoking's Earth Power. Substitute also eases prediction, and since Jolteon has pathetic defenses, that 25% of its HP will not be missed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Jolteon can choose to run a few alternate moves in place of Shadow Ball, since it will no longer be locked into one attack. Yawn is a nice option since it lets Jolteon phaze out the opponent. Protect can be used alongside Yawn in the fourth moveslot. Most opponents would not expect Jolteon to run Protect, so it can Yawn your opponent's switch-in and then use Protect immediately afterward as your foe attempts to attack Jolteon, only to find itself falling asleep. Another possibility to consider is Volt Switch, which gives Jolteon more maneuverability and enables it to scout.</p>

<p>This set relies on entry hazards more heavily than the Choice Specs set. Therefore, it is recommended to have teammates who can set up Spikes and Stealth Rock. Roserade is a nice option to set up Spikes since it can deter most Ground-type Pokemon as well. Other good options are Scolipede, Froslass, and Smeargle, all of which are excellent Spikers. For Stealth Rock, a bulky Pokemon such as Donphan is an excellent choice since it can absorb any physical attack, such as Earthquake, aimed at Jolteon. Just like the Choice Specs set, there are no specific teammates that Jolteon needs. However, Pokemon who naturally draw in Electric-type attacks can help Jolteon nab recovery and a free switch-in.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Jolteon's ability to force frail, slower sweepers such as Azelf and Mismagius out, combined with its excellent Speed stat, enables it to easily set up a Substitute and pass it unscathed. Baton Pass allows Jolteon to quickly escape from the field at the first sight of trouble, and many slower Pokemon will find it impossible to hit Jolteon without a priority move. Baton Pass is also a good way to scout the opponent's team since the mere presence of Jolteon will force many switches. Meanwhile, Jolteon still retains its offensive prowess and excellent neutral coverage with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice. You may wish to use Volt Switch in place of Thunderbolt as a secondary form of scouting. However, Ground-type Pokemon love to switch into Jolteon, so use Volt Switch with great caution.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The teammates who most appreciate Jolteon's ability to regain momentum are frail sweepers such as Azelf and Ambipom. Without Jolteon's Substitute, these sweepers would have a hard time setting up. Other good receivers are Pokemon who resist or are immune to Ground-type moves. Roserade and Shaymin are good examples, as they can easily set up a Substitute + Leech Seed strategy with Jolteon's Substitute, or straight out attack the foe. Jolteon can also pass on boosting moves such as Charge Beam and Work Up along with Substitute. However, since Jolteon is frail, it will rarely have the opportunity to pass both a Substitute and a boosting move at the same time.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Jolteon has a few other tricks it can use. On all three sets, Jolteon can run Hidden Power Grass over Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Grass deals heavy damage to a couple of notable problematic Pokemon, most notably Quagsire and Swampert. However, Jolteon will lose coverage overall, and will have trouble dealing with Pokemon such as Nidoking and Flygon. Rain Dance is a nifty option as it allows Jolteon to fire off 100% accurate Thunders; rain teams will also appreciate Jolteon's ability to absorb incoming Electric-type attacks. Speaking of abilities, Jolteon can opt to use Quick Feet over Volt Absorb. With Quick Feet, a statused Jolteon will not have trouble outspeeding Pokemon who commonly carry a Choice Scarf or uses*a Speed-boosting move. Discharge can replace Thunderbolt if you'd like an increased chance of paralysis, but with Jolteon's lack of bulk, it is generally better to knock out Pokemon outright with Thunderbolt. Jolteon can use Fake Tears to force opponents out or fry special walls, but once again, Jolteon's fragility makes this hard to pull off.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Unless Jolteon runs Hidden Power Grass, Quagsire and Swampert can come in and wall Jolteon all day long. If Jolteon does run Hidden Power Grass, though, then it will have trouble dealing with Roserade and Flygon. Pokemon who use priority moves can gain an upper hand against Jolteon. Hitmontop, for example, can take a hit and then proceed to 2HKO Jolteon with Technician Fake Out + Mach Punch. Choice Band Azumarill can pick off Jolteon with Aqua Jet, but it cannot switch directly into an attack. Bisharp is an interesting counter, as it can use Pursuit to OHKO Jolteon if it switches, or set up with Substitute + Swords Dance. Finally, despite all of its power, Jolteon cannot break through special walls such as Snorlax and Registeel. Registeel isn't even 3HKOed by Choice Specs Thunderbolt, and can 2HKO Jolteon with Earthquake.</p>
