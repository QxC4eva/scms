<p>September 2009 with moot at PAX in Seattle. I think he's the first Smogonite I met that I didn't know offline already. It was a quick meetup before we both had to run our separate ways.</p>

<p>September 2010 with moot again in Seattle for another PAX. At this point I'd met a few others at VGC Seattle! Both of us exhausted and meeting up to hang out for a few minutes before my bus home.</p>

<p>May 2011 with Brain and Vineon while I was visiting Montreal. I'd met Brain when he was visiting Vancouver about five months earlier, but first time getting the chance to butcher Vincent's name in person.</p>
