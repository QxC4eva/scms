Overview
########

Onix is a niche Pokemon because of its unique stats and ability. Due to its Speed, it functions differently than Geodude due to it being able to Taunt and KO Pokemon faster than Geodude can. This is important when dealing with Sticky Web and Shell Smashers. Compared to Gligar and other Stealth Rock users, Sturdy gives it the ability to reliably check a large amount of Pokemon, even ones that use super effective moves like Magnemite.

Moves
========

    Earthquake is Onix's main STAB attack.
    Rock Blast is a very useful secondary STAB attack to deal with other Sturdy Pokemon as well as Substitutes from Pokemon such as Swirlix and Torchic.
    Stealth Rock is one of the main reason to use Onix. Due to its high defense and Sturdy, it will have enough turns to set it up which can be a hard thing to find in fast-paced games.
    Taunt makes Onix the perfect counter for Shell Smashers and Restalkers, as well as preventing set-up by Swirlix or status moves such as Will-O-Wisp from Vulpix.
    Roar can more reliably get Pokemon out of Onix isn't fast enough to Taunt or strong enough to KO, vs Pokemon such as Gligar.

Set Details
========

    EVs are standard; max Speed to outpace most middling Pokemon such as Dwebble or Tirtouga. Attack is maxed and 76 for HP is useful because it lets Onix hit 21 HP.
    It should be noted that at this Speed, Onix still ties with Timid Surskit.

Usage Tips
========

    Onix has two major ways to influence a game.
    If there is a Pokemon that the team needs it to counter such as Murkrow, it can be kept alive and sent in whenever Murkrow makes an appearance and set up Stealth Rock.
    If there is not a Pokemon that Onix needs to be saved for or there is a Pokemon such as Spinarak who is aiming to set up on the first turn, Onix functions as an exceptional lead due to its ability to beat - or almost beat many Pokemon one on one while still getting Stealth Rock up.

Team Options
========

    Onix is a Pokemon that works on just about any team in need of a reliable Stealth Rock user.

Other Options
########

    A Curse + Dragon Tail set could probably be used, but it's outclassed immensely by most other Pokemon.
    Heavy Slam can be used to hit fairies.
    Toxic can be used to hit Hyper Cutter Gligar switch-ins.
    An offensive set could also work, but Onix lacks the power to be threatening enough after a Rock Polish.



Checks & Counters
########

    Onix has the most trouble with certain set up Pokemon that outpace it or have multi-hit moves. Gligar and Shellder come to mind as Pokemon who Onix generally wants to stay away from, but Roar helps.
    Onix has very low Attack, so any Fighting-type can switch into Earthquake and recover HP via Drain Punch.
