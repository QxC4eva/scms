Overview
########

· Great base 140 Attack and good offensive movepool with Earthquake, Rock Slide, Megahorn, Fire Punch and Ice Punch makes it a powerful attacker.
· Good Physical bulk and Solid Rock allows it to take physical hits with ease.
· However, poor special defense and bad defensive typing is easily exploited by common pokemon such as Rotom-Wash, Mega Charizard Y and Grass types.
· Low speed means that it appreciates Trick Room a lot.

Moves
========

· Earthquake is its most powerful STAB move
· Rock Slide has good coverage with EQ, a good 30% flinch chance, and does not hit teammates.
· Stone Edge is a stronger alternative to Rock Slide and Megahorn, and can avoid Wide Guard.
· Ice Punch hits Landorus-t and should be used with Life Orb to OHKO it at -1o
· Protect allows it to last longer and gives its partner a turn to set up Trick Room

Set Details
========

· Max Attack allows it to hit hard and Max HP for bulk.
· Life Orb can be used to boost Rhyperior’s power, while Sitrus Berry gives it more longevity.


Usage Tips
========

· Rhyperior should stay out of the field until Trick Room is up, using Protect and switching out when necessary.
· Rhyperior is a great late-game sweeper in Trick Room, so it and a Trick Room partner should be kept until late-game to sweep.

Team Options
========

· Light Screen support is great, and Rhyperior loves Trick Room.
· Grasses are good for sponging Water/ Grass Attacks that Rhyperior hates, as well as resisting EQ. Trevenant is a good partner as it also has an immunity to Fighting and access to Trick Room.
· Levitate users and Flying types make great partners to Rhyperior as they are immune to Earthquake.
· Cresselia can provide Trick Room, Light Screen (Mentioned above), Helping Hand support, and can also do well against two mons that threaten it— Landorus-t and Hitmontop with Ice Beam/ Icy Wind and Psyshock respectively. It also has Levitate.
· Sand can be used to boost Rhyperior’s low Special Defense.

Other Options
########

· Lightningrod can be used to redirect electric attacks from its teammates, but it sacrifices the bulk that Solid Rock gives.
· Explosion can be used, but is usually outclassed by other options which provide better coverage.
·Megahorn can be used to hit Cresselia and Grass types.
· Avalanche can be run outside of Trick Room as a stronger alternative to Ice Punch.
·Lum Berry sets can be run to avoid burns and other status
· Assault Vest can be used to boost Rhyperior’s low Special Defense at the expense of Protect.
·Weakness Policy can be run to take advantage of its many weaknesses and Solid Rock. These items, however, are very situational
·Stealth Rock can be used to cut down the longevity of Charizard Y, Talonflame, Pinsir, Volcarona, etc.
· Swords Dance boosts Rhyperior’s attack to aid it in sweeping.
· Drill Run bypasses Wide Guard, hits harder than EQ, and does not affect your teammates.

Checks & Counters
########

**Speed Control**: Cutting Trick Room support from Rhyperior by means of Taunt, Roar/Whirlwind, or another Trick Room will hurt it badly.
**Attack Control **: Rhyperior, as a physical attacker, does not like the physical drop of Intimidate and will thus usually be forced to switch out. Hitmontop and Landorus-T are good examples of this.
**Utility Moves **: Wide Guard prevents Rhyperior from using its two STAB spread moves, Rock Slide and Earthquake, but Rhyperior can bypass this by running Stone Edge, Megahorn or Ice Punch.
**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Ammonguss, with enough physical investment, can switch into any of its moves bar Ice Punch and Fire Punch and 2HKO back with Giga Drain.
·Checking it is easier however, and Rhyperior’s 4x weaknesses in Grass and Water, and its low speed are exploitable by Pokemon like Rotom-Wash and Mega Charizard Y.
