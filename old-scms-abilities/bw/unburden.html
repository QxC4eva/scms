Speed increases when an item is used or lost.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder consumes an item or has one removed from it (for example via <a href="/bw/moves/knock_off">Knock Off</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/bug_bite">Bug Bite</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/fling">Fling</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/natural_gift">Natural Gift</a>) its Speed is doubled until it switches out. This boost is not a change to the wielder's Speed stage, so if it were to use <a href="/bw/moves/agility">Agility</a> after Unburden activates, it would have four times its original Speed. The Unburden boost cannot be <a href="/bw/moves/baton_pass">Baton Pass</a>ed, and losing items after the first does not provide additional boosts. Unburden will not activate if the wielder simply has no item; an item must be removed for it to activate.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>As Unburden is only available on a few viable Pokemon, its competitive use is limited. <a href="/bw/pokemon/sceptile">Sceptile</a> is probably the main user and can take advantage of it to get a further boost out of item and ability combinations like <a href="/bw/items/flying_gem">Flying Gem</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>. Otherwise, Unburden is barely seen, as all the other Pokemon with the ability are not fit for competitive OU battles, and the Speed boost cannot be Baton Passed.</p>
