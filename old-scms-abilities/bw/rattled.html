<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is hit by a Bug-, Dark-, or Ghost-type attack, its Speed is raised by one stage. A Speed boost will be granted for each hit of a multi-hit attack.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/granbull">Granbull</a> prefers <a href="/bw/abilities/intimidate">Intimidate</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/dunsparce">Dunsparce</a> has <a href="/bw/abilities/serene_grace">Serene Grace</a> as its only gimmick. <a href="/bw/pokemon/sudowoodo">Sudowoodo</a> really needs the Speed boosts, but is usually too frail to get fast enough before dying. In short, don't expect to see Rattled much competitively, as it is both situational and located on less than stellar Pokemon.</p>
