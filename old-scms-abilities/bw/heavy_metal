<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder's weight is doubled. This increases the power of the wielder's <a href="/bw/moves/heat_crash">Heat Crash</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/heavy_slam">Heavy Slam</a>, reduces damage taken from an opponent's Heat Crash and Heavy Slam, and increases damage taken from an opponent's <a href="/bw/moves/grass_knot">Grass Knot</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/low_kick">Low Kick</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/bronzong">Bronzong</a> will always prefer its other abilities simply because they have more defensive utility. <a href="/bw/pokemon/aggron">Aggron</a> prefers <a href="/bw/abilities/rock_head">Rock Head</a> to be able to use <a href="/bw/moves/head_smash">Head Smash</a> without worry, as opposed to a slightly more powerful Heavy Slam.</p>
