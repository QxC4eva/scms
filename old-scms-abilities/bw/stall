[SHORT DESC]
The wielder moves last.

[LONG DESC] 
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder will move last as long as its opponent chooses moves in the same priority bracket. If two Pokemon that have Stall are out at the same time, the faster Pokemon will move last. If the wielder is facing a Pokemon holding <a href="/bw/items/lagging_tail">Lagging Tail</a> or <a href="/bw/items/full_incense">Full Incense</a>, the Pokemon with Lagging Tail or Full Incense will move last. If a Pokemon with Stall is holding one of these items, Stall is ignored. Stall ignores all effects of <a href="/bw/moves/trick_room">Trick Room</a> for this Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The only user is <a href="/bw/pokemon/sableye">Sableye</a>, and Sableye relies on Prankster to be effective, so there is no competitive use currently for this ability, and no foreseeable one in future generations. About the only thing it does for Sableye is ensure a full-powered <a href="/bw/moves/payback">Payback</a>, which isn't really worth going last every turn.</p>
