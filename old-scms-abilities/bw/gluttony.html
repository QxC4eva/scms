<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A pinch Berry (<a href="/bw/items/liechi_berry">Liechi</a>, <a href="/bw/items/salac_berry">Salac</a>, etc.) will be consumed by the wielder at 50% maximum HP or less instead of the usual 25% or less.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Gluttony's early activation of pinch Berries can be immensely helpful for sweepers reliant on such Berries. In the fourth generation, <a href="/bw/pokemon/linoone">Linoone</a> loved to use Gluttony to activate its Salac Berry right after a <a href="/bw/moves/belly_drum">Belly Drum</a> to line up a possible Belly Drum sweep. Unfortunately, Gluttony isn't useful at all without those handy Berriesâ€”and even more unfortunately, despite being available now in BW, the multitude of powerful, fast threats and priority moves have rendered the strategy somewhat obsolete. If you feel like humbling someone in NU, though, there's no better candidate for the job than Belly Drum Linoone.</p>
