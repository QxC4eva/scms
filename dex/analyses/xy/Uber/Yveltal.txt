Overview
########

A beast even the game acknowledges as the Destruction Pokemon, Yveltal is an incredibly versatile terror with a potent mix of offensive and defensive qualities. Offensively, its Dark- and Flying-type dual STAB is resisted by few Pokemon and hurts mightily coming off a solid base 131 Special Attack stat. Dark Aura further augments Yveltal's offensive prowess by giving it a free Life Orb boost to its Dark-type STAB attacks. Yveltal's power is nicely supplemented by a solid base 99 Speed stat; while not the fastest threat, it does allow Yveltal to easily outspeed all of the Ubers stuck in the base 90 crowd, and it can tear a huge chunk out of faster opponents with the strongest Sucker Punch in the game. Furthermore, Oblivion Wing gives Yveltal surprisingly high sustainability for an offensive Pokemon, allowing it to remain a prominent threat throughout the entirety of a match. Defensively, Yveltal boasts impressive bulk, coveted resistances to Ghost- and Dark-type attacks, useful immunities to Ground-type attacks, Spikes, and Sticky Web, and reliable healing in Roost. Dark Aura-boosted Foul Play enables it to check top sweepers such as Swords Dance Arceus and Mewtwo and hit quite hard without even needing to invest in its offensive stats.

Yveltal's flaws are few but nonetheless annoying. Fairy-type Pokemon such as Xerneas and Fairy Arceus make life very difficult for Yveltal as it has significant trouble breaking through them. Yveltal's typing also leaves it with some annoying weaknesses to Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks that somewhat hamper its defensive abilities. Overall, Yveltal's powerful attributes and ability to cover its uninvested stats with the right moves make it a prominent threat to watch out for in Ubers.


Taunt + 3 Attacks
########
name: Taunt + 3 Attacks
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Oblivion Wing
move 4: Sucker Punch / Focus Blast / Foul Play
ability: Dark Aura
item: Life Orb
nature: Mild / Rash
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Yveltal is one of the few Ubers-viable Pokemon that learns Taunt, a move that it puts to great use in shutting down walls, foiling status moves, and blocking attempts to use Defog or set up entry hazards. It allows Yveltal to break stall teams pretty efficiently and is a useful move to pair with Sucker Punch as it will force opponents to use an attack. Bolstered by Dark Aura, Dark Pulse is an extremely potent STAB option with few resists and great power: it easily 2HKOes 252 HP Arceus formes (assuming Arceus is not a type that resists Dark) and deals significant damage to most other Pokemon that attempt to switch in. Oblivion Wing is Yveltal's other primary STAB option; aside from demolishing Fighting-types and hitting Fairy-types neutrally, Oblivion Wing also allows Yveltal to sustain itself for an admirably long time by draining huge amounts of HP from its targets. Sucker Punch is generally the best move to round out the set as it provides Yveltal with a way to cleanly finish off faster switch-ins; for example, Dark Pulse followed by Sucker Punch is an easy 2HKO on Pokemon such as Palkia, Zekrom, and Kyogre. Sucker Punch also OHKOes Mewtwo, making Yveltal a very good check to it thanks to its immunity to Psychic-type attacks.

Yveltal also has a few other moves it can run in place of Sucker Punch. Focus Blast is a solid option as it obliterates Tyranitar who otherwise completely walls Yveltal. Focus Blast also does much more damage to Heatran, Dialga, and Rock Arceus than Dark Pulse. Foul Play can be used to 2HKO Ho-Oh, who avoids the 2HKO from Dark Pulse due to its great Special Defense, and wreck boosting physical sweepers such as Swords Dance Arceus that might attempt to set up. Foul Play can also potentially be used over Dark Pulse as it still hits a lot of Pokemon for a 2HKO in conjunction with Sucker Punch, but be warned as without Dark Pulse Yveltal cannot threaten to 2HKO 252 HP Arceus. U-turn is also a decent option as it allows Yveltal to bait in and pivot out of defensive Fairy-types into a trapper such as Mega Gengar, leaving them helpless and Yveltal potentially free to wreak havoc later in the match. However, U-turn does not offer much in the way of additional coverage and isn't very useful against offensive teams.

Set Details
========

Mild is generally the best nature for Yveltal to run as it provides it with a sizable power boost, and it can still outspeed neutral natured base 90 Speed Pokemon, Rayquaza, and Kyurem-W. Sucker Punch also reduces the need for a Speed-boosting nature as well. Mild is generally preferred since Yveltal's resistances are predominantly for Special attacks, though Rash can also be used to better take hits from Mega Mewtwo X and physical Ghost Arceus sets. A Modest nature can also be run if not using Sucker Punch; in this case, shift the 4 EVs in Attack to Defense so as to not be wasteful. Running a Hasty (or Naive/Timid) nature can also work if you absolutely need to ensure that Yveltal will outspeed all base 90 Speed Pokemon, Rayquaza, and Kyurem-W.

Generally simply maximizing Special Attack and Speed is best for Yveltal so it can be as strong and as fast as possible, but between useful utility options in Foul Play and Sucker Punch, Yveltal can afford to make some creative tweaks to its EV spread. Running Sucker Punch could possibly allow for more bulk investment, and using Foul Play with some Defense EVs to check Mega Mewtwo X and Swords Dance Arceus can work decently as well.

Usage Tips
========
Just kill things
Good wallbreaker, can harass support Arceus with Oblivion Wing and then Taunt them when forced to Recover.
Try not to be predictable with Sucker Punch. Thankfully, Yveltal isn't reliant on it.
Strong at all points of the game, and can likely survive for that long.

Team Options
========
Works well with something that can check Xerneas. Scizor, Klefki, Jirachi, and Bronzong are good options. They can also check Fairyceus and Rockceus, but watch out for possible burns.
Mega Gengar can trap and kill Fairyceus.
If you don't have Foul Play, use a good Stealth Rock setter such as Groudon, Landorus-T, or Dialga to help keep Ho-Oh at bay. You can also run a dedicated counter such as Rock Arceus, but it may not be required if you can keep SR up.
A Zekrom check is appreciated. Groudon, Dialga, Landorus-T, and Ground Arceus are fair options. These Pokemon also check Tyranitar who is annoying to a Yveltal without Focus Blast. RP Groudon/SD Arceus-Ground are nice offensive partners since Yveltal can easily come in on many things that wall them such as Gliscor.
Dialga also checks Rockceus/Eleceus who are annoying for Yveltal.
Defog support to get rid of Stealth Rock - Giratina-O or support Arceus formes. It's not required since Yveltal can heal itself with Oblivion Wing, but it's helpful to switch around more.

Physical Tank
########
name: Physical Tank
move 1: Foul Play
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Toxic / Sucker Punch
move 4: Roost
ability: Dark Aura
item: Leftovers / Rocky Helmet
nature: Bold / Impish
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD

Moves
========
Foul Play helps this set define its role - it allows Yveltal to punish powerful physical attackers, while using its respectable physical bulk to tank them.
Taunt grants it an additional utility as a stallbreaker.
Toxic cripples Fairyceus and Xerneas, as well as things like Ho-Oh, Lugia, etc.
Roost is mandatory for sustain -- Oblivion Wing will not recover enough to make it a dedicated staller
Sucker Punch can be an option. It is still extremely powerful even without investment, easily OHKOing Mega Mewtwo Y, and it gives Yveltal additional utility as a revenge killer.

Set Details
========
Is physically bulkier than 252/252+ Skarmory
Use Impish if using Sucker Punch, otherwise use Bold to minimize Foul play damage from enemy Yveltal.
Rocky Helmet can put +2 Extremekiller into Foul Play kill range if it decides to use Extreme Speed.


Usage Tips
========

It can check Mega Mewtwo X (as well as special Mewtwos/Deoxys-A without Ice Beam) and various forms of Swords Dance Arceus. Notable ones include Ground, Normal, and Ghost.
You may need to predict switch ins with Taunt or Toxic. However, since this set is designed to be bulky, you'll find yourself switching in often, so you have a lot of chances to punish.
Don't try to stall out special attackers with this set, unless you know that they'll be doing less than 50%.
Avoid getting Toxiced or Burned as it completely kills your stalling ability.
Relatively straightforward set

Team Options
========
As a designated counter to certain Pokemon, it is best that you don't build your team around this Yveltal. Rather, you should fit Yveltal in based on your team's needs. Need a Ghost resist? Extremekiller giving you trouble? Throw this in.
A cleric such as Xerneas, Sylveon, or Blissey are decent partners to help remove surprise status conditions that can fatally ruin this set.
Klefki beats Xerneas and can help spread Toxic around to stall/set up Spikes.
Use with Defog support preferably. Mega Scizor is neat since it also checks Xerneas, which this set can give free switches to.
Ground-types are still good partners since Yveltal can't wall Zekrom.


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Dark Pulse
move 2: Hurricane
move 3: Foul Play / Oblivion Wing
move 4: U-turn / Focus Blast
ability: Dark Aura
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Modest
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========
Dark Pulse is pretty spammable and can flinch your way to victory (hi there Melee_Mewtwo)
Hurricane gets a guaranteed OHKO on Mega Mewtwo X and hurts Fairies a lot. Rain support is helpful to patch up its accuracy.
Foul Play can revenge kill high attack targets such as Swords Dance Groundceus and Ghostceus
Oblivion Wing grants it a longer lifespan than most Scarfers. It is also somewhat spammable, but is pretty weak without an item boost - for example, it doesn't OHKO M2X (96% max)
U-turn can scout for things but don't expect it to hurt.
Focus Blast OHKOes Darkrai and wrecks Tyranitar.
Toxic can also be used to catch Fairies/Ho-Oh by surprise.
Set Details
========
Modest nature is recommended Scarf Yveltal isn't particularly strong and appreciates the extra power. Yveltal still outruns most of the relevant scarfers without the +Speed.
Faster than +1 base 90s and 95s, and Speed ties with Scarf Genesect if you go Timid.

Usage Tips
========
If your team needs a Ghost-resisting Scarfer that can take on all Mewtwo formes, SD Groundceus, Ghostceus, and Rayquaza, Scarf Yveltal can work for you.
Not very easily punishable - Dark Pulse is pretty spammable and Oblivion Wing gives it recovery if you use it.
Solid cleaner, so look for the lategame.

Team Options
========

Don't build around Scarf Yveltal -- bring Scarf Yveltal based on your team's needs.
Nothing really different from the earlier sets - Defog and things that beat Fairies (Steels).
Poisonceus is cool with this set as it can CM on most Fairies and appreciates Yveltal's ability to switch in on and wreck Mewtwo + Yveltal is immune to both of Poisonceus's weaknesses.
Mega Gengar can take out Fairies that Yveltal U-turns out of.
Kyogre is nice to patch up Hurricane's accuracy Hurricane. Yveltal can check Grass Arceus for Kyogre, but be warned as both are weak to Electric.

Other Options
########
Substitute / Disable can cause a lot of headaches. Substitute in general can synergize with Sucker Punch and Oblivion Wing, so it's not a bad pickup on the mixed set.
Assault Vest is a viable pickup for Yveltal as it has the power and bulk for it. Furthermore, it can sustain with Oblivion Wing. You do lose the ability to Taunt, however, which makes Yveltal less effective against stall.
Weakness Policy can be very frightening if successfully pulled off. Yveltal is probably one of the best Pokemon in the game at using this item due to its high stats, recovery from Oblivion Wing, and the ability to destroy Scarfers with Sucker Punch.
Choice Specs Yveltal deals a lot of damage (its Dark Pulse is roughly as strong as that of +2 Darkrai), but not being able to Sucker Punch freely or make real use of Taunt restricts its flexibility. It can however potentially 2HKO Ho-Oh with Dark Pulse.
A Specially Defensive version of the tank set is viable. Instead of specifically checking certain threats, it aims to use the combination of its special bulk and Foul Play to form a sturdy, general wall. However, most of Yveltal's weaknesses are specially based which hurts its tanking ability.
Rock Slide can be used if you really hate Ho-Oh.
Thief is decently strong and can mess with walls by stealing their Leftovers, though it doesn't affect support Arceus which makes it a lesser option. It does have the ability to cripple Geomancy Xerneas by stealing Power Herb however.
Steel Wing 2HKOes Diancie.


Checks & Counters
########
Fairyceus, Sylveon, and Xerneas are probably your best counters, but they all despise Toxic. Refresh Fairy Arceus hardcounters Yveltal, although that variant is rare.
Klefki dislikes Taunt but otherwise walls Yveltal's STABs and can Spike/Toxic.
Physically defensive Ho-Oh is quite solid as Regenerate helps combat Toxic, although LO Dark Pulse still hurts.
Tyranitar destroys it if it lacks Focus Blast, though it can be worn down by Toxic.
Rock Arceus doesn't like Dark Pulse too much and hates Focus Blast/Toxic but is otherwise a fine check.
Electric Arceus can set up Calm Mind on sets without Toxic and destroy Yveltal with STAB Judgement.
Zekrom and Kyurem-W can hit it with SE STABs but keep in mind that Dark Pulse and Sucker Punch will hurt.
Kyogre kills defensive Yveltal.
Status is annoying - Toxic ruins defensive sets and burn cripples Sucker Punch/Foul Play.
