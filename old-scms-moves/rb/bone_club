<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to flinch.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This move should never be used competitively, due to its poor Base Power, low flinch chance, and poor distribution; the move is learnt only by Cubone and Marowak. However, not only are they rare sights, they would both prefer to use the more powerful Earthquake or Bonemerang.</p>
