		<p>Hello readers!</p>
		
		<p>This month has been very exciting on the sim and in the webzine! PSPL has recently finished with Italiano being crowned the winners after weeks of battling. Congratulations to them! The webzine has also had a lick of paint from <a href-"/forums/members/quarkz.206020/">Quarkz</a> who has been updating the layout to be more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
		
		<p>This issue has been a rollercoaster to release but the end product is marvellous! Big thanks especially to MiniArchitect for doing a fantastic job with the Spiritomb for this issue's cover art. I hope you enjoy reading this issue as much as we did.</p>
		
		<p>Happy Halloween!</p>

		<p>Issue 4 has some fantastic reads, such as the <a href="sky-battles-102">Sky Battles 102</a>, <a href="interview-with-briyella">Interview with Goddess Briyella</a>, and Spydreigon's look at <a href="staff-communication">how staff communicate</a>. Thanks to <a href="/forums/members/shaymin.178207/">shaymin</a>, <a href="/forums/members/quarkz.206020/">Quarkz</a>, and <a href="/forums/members/offler.208105/">offler</a> for their help during release, and I wish you a pleasant read!</p>
