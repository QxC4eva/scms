Overview
########

- Finally useful because of Mega Evolution
- After it Mega Evolves, its Special Attack becomes the highest of any Electric- or Dragon-type at 165 and it still retains above average bulk
- That combined with low Speed makes it perfect for a bulky Trick Room attacker
- Desperately needs Trick Room and Wide Guard support to reach potential

Mega Trick Room Attacker
########
name: Mega Trick Room Attacker
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Dragon Pulse
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Protect
ability: Static
item: Ampharosite
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD
nature: Quiet

Moves
========
- Thunderbolt and Dragon Pulse are powerful STAB moves with excellent coverage
- Focus Blast wrecks Tyranitar, Heatran, and Scrafty
- Protect allows Ampharos to scout or evade damage while its partner sets up Trick Room or takes out one of its counters

Set Details
========
- Quiet + 252 SpA - max power
- Max HP - best overall bulk, Speed investment is unhelpful because Mega Ampharos is meant to be used in Trick Room
- Ampharosite - only reason to use Ampharos. Without it, it would be outclassed

Usage Tips
========
In Trick Room as a powerful battering ram taking out or weakening one pokemon at a time

Team Options
========
- Trick Room support is essential as it allows for Ampharos to get around its only low stat, its Speed. Among Trick Room users, Aromatisse can also strike the Dragon-types that scare Ampharos while being immune to their Dragon-type attacks, while Cresselia and Gourgeist resist the Ground-type attacks that are fired Ampharos's way.
- Wide Guard support is necessary given Ampharos's weakness to Earthquake and Blizzard. Notable Wide Guard users include Aegislash, which resists the Dragon- and Ice-type attacks that threaten Ampharos, while Hariyama and Conkeldurr scare away Ice-types with their Fighting-type STABs.
- With Politoed, Ampharos can fire off powerful 100% accurate Thunders, dealing more damage than Thunderbolt. However, in other weathers, Thunder's accuracy very unreliable.
- Ice-types threaten Dragon- and Ground- types. Glaceon and Regice fit well in Trick Room; unfortunately, Mega Abomasnow and Mega Ampharos can't be used together.

Other Options
########

- Discharge - useful spread move, but it is not powerful enough to achieve several 1HKOs and 2HKOs.
- Thunder Wave - useful support for slowing down opponents to around Mega Ampharos's Speed, but it is counterproductive in Trick Room
- Agility - patches up its Speed, allowing it to be used on non-Trick Room teams
- Heal Bell could support team but it is better off attacking

Checks & Counters
########

**Earthquake**:

Mega Ampharos's weakness to Earthquake will often lead to its demise. Outside of Trick Room, Garchomp, Landorus, and Zygarde can outspeed and take it out. Inside of Trick Room, Rhyperior can also outrun it. However, Wide Guard on Ampharos's side of the field often leads to a wasted turn.

**Dragon-types**: 

Garchomp, Salamence, and Dragonite prey on its weakness to its own type, outspeeding and KOing. However, during Trick Room, Ampharos gains the upper hand in Speed.

**Mega Abomasnow**: 

Another crippling issue is Ampharos's Blizzard weakness. Mega Abomasnow outspeeds Ampharos when Trick Room is in play and destroys it with Blizzard.

**Gengar**: 

While not exactly a counter to Ampharos, it can beat almost every Trick Room user, rendering Ampharos extremely slow and easy to outspeed and KO by most of the above Pokemon.
