<p>Okay, I'm not going to tell you about my subway ride to Nintendo World, though my brother and me were pissed since the D Train made all local stops. So we arrive at Nintendo World at 47-50 Street, which was in need of a makeover. FYI, I didn't enter the tournament because there were to many fat people... Anyways...</p>

<p>The people who were there for 13 and over were 50% fat, 10% 20+, and 40% Asian (including myself).</p>

<h2>Heros or Spectators</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Jimmy 'Blazemxx' Dang</dt>
<dd>He apparently has a fan club full of noobs and crap... noobs who need tic-tacs...</dd>
<dt>Peter 'Pikachu' Something</dt>
<dd>The fattest one, not actually a hero. Sports Munchlax wear and is too fat for his own good. I've might of said gj, but that's a lie! Blazemxx doesn't know his last name...</dd>
<dt>Peter 'Pikachu' Something</dt>
<dd>He lost in the third round, but imo the most skillful. Good job to you.</dd>

<p>And, a couple of smart hispanics and Asians...</p>

<p>We're standing outside Nintendo, but I thought this was the national tourney. So I'm looking for any Smogoners on line, but there was nobody there. Turns out this were actually the second New York regional. So I'm like "cool, three tournaments in New York..." So it was raining that day and we say a fucking kid that thought he was cool for sliding on the streets with his shoes. My brother's like "Hey Jimmy, I'm going to trip that kid." So he was about to, but the kid's mother told him to stop doing that so I'm like "WTF?" Anyways, I saw a couple of people sparring before the tournament by doing a link battle. This guy named Miguel, who I believed had a good strategy. He leads with Dusclops and Mewtwo, both who have Pressure. He starts off with two protects, so he can pressure stall. An enemy Kyogre used a Water Spout on them, making it waste all its PP. The enemy Ludicolo tried a Fake Out, but nothing worked. Turn two, the Dusclops Imprisons the foes to block Protect, and then Mewtwo blew up. Kyogre fainted iirc and Ludicolo survived. Then, I missed the rest since a fat guy blocked the way. Anyways, they let us in the store...</p>

<p>Registration for the 12 and under tournament began, but it didn't start yet. I run into an annoying 8 year that was a fucking noob at everything, using six ubers and thinking he's big. He's like blowing his nasty breath on me, and his brother is like "You need a TicTac" and I'm like "lol." He's like "Me and my brother is a big fan of my work," and shit like that and I'm like "my work? What the fuck you talking about?" So he tells me to rate his team, and I'm like "Return is better Hyper Beam, 102 x 2 = 204 is better than 150 idiot" and he's like Hyper Beam is the strongest attack I got. He thinks Hyper Beam is better because of the power. I'm looking through his noobish move sets like Mewtwo using Psychic / Hyper Beam / Recover / Shadow Ball, and shit like that. So he wants my friends' sharked Celebi and shit like that. He tells me to battle him and I lose because I forgot I was battling a person who doesn't switch and uses Groudon and Kyogre on the same team. I had sharked non ev trained Pokémon so I felt sorry for him. At first he was sweating and purposely using stupid moves like Eruption on 2v2 with on my Snorlax when it was raining and I'm like "lol." This battle was stupid so I'll skip it, I ended up having to forfeit because his mom was getting pissed since she was tired. So I traded my Celebi (who had Water Pulse / Psychic / Shadow Ball / Giga Drain, which was funny) for a fucked up lv.100 Jirachi (Doom Desire / Psychic / Double Edge / Thunderbolt).</p>

<p>Twelve and under tourney started around 11 iirc... They announced the matches for the first of round one, but I'll skip to the end. Funny thing that happened though, a kid that had 75 Groudon, 86 Raichiu, 64 Charizard, and 84 Rayquaza made it to the second round. I felt sorry for the guy who lost to him.</p>

<p>*plays fast forwarding thingy* This match actually had people with brains. This first finalist had a joke Wooper which he named OMG Woopa, and I'm like cool, joke Wooper.</p>

<p>The kids were Josh vs. ZERO (ingame names, I forgot the real ones...). It starts off with Kyogre and Mewtwo against Mewtwo and Lugia respectively. ZERO's Mewtwo used a Protect and Lugia Substituted. Both were faster so I assume he EV trained. Kyogre Protects and Mewtwo blows up. John (the announcer and my old friend who I haven't seen in a long time) and everyone is like "Ohhhhh! Dissed!" The Sub fades away... So he replaces Mewtwo for a Ho-oh. Next turn, Lugia Thunders Kyogre for ~75% and then Ho-oh Thunders Lugia. Lugia has ~1/5 HP left. Lugia tries to Sub again, but he has too low health. Next turn, they hit Mewtwo who has ¼ HP left. Lugia Recovers. I forgot what happens around this, so I'll skip... ZERO sends out a Kyogre and it goes 2on1 with Ho-oh. Ho-oh kills Lugia and to an upset, Kyogre kills the max HP Ho-oh. John is like "What an upset!" The kid gets a prize or something and gives his gamepak to get checked...</p>
