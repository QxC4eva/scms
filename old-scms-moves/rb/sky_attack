<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Charges up turn one, and then attacks turn two.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Like all moves that take a turn to charge up, Sky Attack is not a good competitive move. In fact, Sky Attack is probably the worst of the charge-up moves, due to the fact that it does not allow the user to avoid most attacks, meaning it will most likely take a large hit while Sky Attack is charging. Sky Attack's imperfect accuracy also presents a problem, as it will sometimes give the opponent two free turns instead of one. Like all charge-up moves, Sky Attack allows the opponent to easily switch to a counter that can easily absorb the Sky Attack, giving the opponent momentum. Do not use this move.</p>
