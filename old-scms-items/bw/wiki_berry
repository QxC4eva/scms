<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Restores the HP of the holder by 1/8 of its maximum HP when at 50% HP or less. Consumed after use. If the holder has an Adamant, Careful, Impish, or Jolly nature, it will also confuse the holder upon activation. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Rock-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Interestingly enough, merely staying in for two turns with Leftovers will heal the exact same amount as Wiki Berry, without even being used upâ€”or, indeed, confusing you. Indeed, even in fast-paced metagames where you are unlikely to get the time to heal even this much with Leftovers, there are better options available. For VGC and Battle Subway, Sitrus Berry heals twice as much of your HP, and in Little Cup, Oran Berry will heal more HP in every single case. Long story short, don't bother using this.</p>
