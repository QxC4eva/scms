<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to boost the user's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>

<p>AncientPower is not an especially useful move competitively. It is not even the most powerful special Rock-type attack, as Hidden Power Rock packs greater power and considerably more PP. When you add this to the fact that the majority of Rock-types have abysmal Special Attack, and that most do not even learn the move, you will realize that the damage output from AncientPower is never going to be great. Therefore, unless you plan on getting very lucky with AncientPower's 10% effect chance, it is probably not worth using. It may, however, see some use in finishing off weakened Pokemon, giving a potential sweeping chance with no obvious drawback, and may be used with a Serene Grace Pokemon such as Togekiss, since the chance of a stat increase is doubled.</p>
