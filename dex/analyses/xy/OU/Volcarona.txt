Overview
########

Despite a typing that makes it 4x weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to every entry hazard, Volcarona is able to be a threatening Pokemon because of its unique features. It is by far the best offensive user of Quiver Dance, one of the best boosting moves in the game, which makes it a powerful sweeper. It has good STABs as well, giving it solid coverage and power. Access to Roost allows it to stick around all game until it is ready to sweep, and its typing helps it check several offensive threats. Its Speed is good for sweeping, but it's not great unboosted. Volcarona is also very weak to priority, making it difficult in some games. However, it can still be a formidable sweeper if its counters are removed.

Bulky Quiver Dance
########
name: Bulky Quiver Dance
move 1: Quiver Dance
move 2: Roost
move 3: Bug Buzz
move 4: Fiery Dance
ability: Flame Body
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 240 HP / 252 Def / 16 Spe

Moves
========

Quiver Dance is a phenomenal move, and with this set Volcarona can set up multiple boosts. Roost pairs well to give Volcarona reliable recovery and not get worn down. Its two STABs work well in the last slots. Bug Buzz can hit through Substitutes and is a fairly powerful move, and gets decent coverage with Fiery Dance. That is its best Fire STAB, giving it a good chance of additional Special Attack boosts. Not many options can be used instead of these moves. If you want to have insurance against status instead of one-turn recovery, then Rest can be used with a Chesto Berry instead of Roost and Leftovers.

Set Details
========

The EVs and Timid nature allow Volcarona to outspeed Jolly Breloom unboosted, base 130 Speed pokemon after 1 boost, and everything after 2 boosts. The rest is put into Defense and HP to let it get as many boosts as possible. The HP EV's allow it to take less damage from Stealth Rock so it can switch in twice, and Defense is maximized. Flame Body is useful to have a chance of burning physical attackers.

Usage Tips
========

Volcarona doesn't hit exceptionally hard, so it should be preserved for a late-game sweep. Before then, it can pivot into some attacks that it resists when Stealth Rock isn't up. It needs Pokemon that can revenge kill it like Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Azumarill removed in order to sweep. When it does set up, it should get multiple boosts with Roost. It's also important not to set up if your opponent has phazers that you can't easily beat like Hippowdon.

Team Options
========

A Rapid Spinner or Defogger is necessary to let Volcarona avoid hazard damage whenever possible. Excadrill, Latios, Latias, and Skarmory can supply this. Volcarona also appreciates hazards on the other side, which can be supplied by Hippowdon, Landorus-T, or Tyranitar. Tyranitar can also deal with Talonflame with ease. Wallbreakers like Specs Keldeo, Aegislash, and Kyurem-B also help. Mega Charizard Y can help wear down Volcarona's counters, but it will compound the Rock weakness. 

Other Options
########

An Offensive Quiver Dance set is good too, with max Special Attack, max Speed, a Life Orb or Lum Berry, and Giga Drain or Hidden Power Ground instead of Roost. Fire Blast or Flamethrower can be used over Fiery Dance if you desire, since they are fairly similar. Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Talonflame on the switch. Choiced sets can be used, but they are dubious with Volcarona's hazard weakness.

Checks & Counters
########

- **Stealth Rock**: If you can keep this up, it will be very difficult for Volcarona to be effective.

- **Status**: Toxic puts a timer on Volcarona, and Paralysis lets it be revenge killed.

- **Special Walls**: Although they need Toxic to actually stop Volcarona from sweeping, Chansey, Blissey, Heatran, Tentacruel, and Jellicent can all wall Volcarona without too many boosts.

- **Revenge Killers**: Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Azumarill can always take out Volcarona. Azumarill also resists its STABs.

- **Offensive Pokemon that resist both STABs**: These pokemon can easily switch in on an unboosted Volcarona and check it. This includes Dragonite, Terrakion, Azumarill, Gyarados, Keldeo, Talonflame, and either Mega Charizard.
