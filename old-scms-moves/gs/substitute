<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Takes 1/4 the user's max HP to create a Substitute that takes damage and blocks non-damaging moves until it's broken or the user switches. If Substitute "blocks" something, it means that if a Substitute is up, whatever is blocked will fail if targeted at the Pokémon behind the Substitute. Unless specifically noted, all moves work normally when used by a Pokémon that has a Substitute up.</p>

<p>Substitute blocks all status effects. Future Sight does damage to the Substitute. All other end-of-turn damage is done to the Pokémon, not the Substitute. Substitute blocks flinching.</p>

<p>Substitute blocks Leech Seed, Ghost-type's Curse, Dream Eater, Lock-On, Mimic, Mind Reader, Nightmare, and Sketch.</p>

<p>Substitute does not block Destiny Bond, Disable, Foresight, Haze, Perish Song, Psych Up, Roar, Spite, Transform, or Whirlwind.</p>

<p>Present damages the Substitute if it rolls damage, but heals the Pokémon if it rolls healing.</p>

<p>Rage does not boost Attack when a Substitute is hit.</p>

<p>If a Pokémon has a Substitute up and switches out, the Substitute will take the damage from Pursuit.</p>

<p>Moves that leech damage still leech when used on a Substitute.</p>

<p>If a multi-hit move breaks the Substitute, successive hits will damage the Pokémon that was formerly behind the Substitute.</p>

<p>When Baton Passed, Substitute keeps its HP. The Substitute does not take damage from Spikes; the Pokémon receiving the Substitute does.</p>

<p>Partial-trapping moves (Bind, Clamp, Fire Spin, Whirlpool, and Wrap) do their single-hit damage, but do not do any end-of-turn damage, nor do they trap for 2-5 turns. Substitute blocks the effects of an enemy's full-trapping move (Mean Look and Spider Web).</p>

<p>Damage due to a Pokémon hitting itself in its confusion goes straight to the Pokémon, not to the Substitute. Recoil goes to the user, not the Substitute. Substitute blocks both the stat boost and the confusion of Swagger.</p>

<p>Pokémon cannot Counter or Mirror Coat damage done to Substitutes. Pokémon cannot store energy via Bide with damage done to a Substitute.</p>

<p>Super Fang does damage based on the Pokémon's HP, not the Substitute's. False Swipe can break Substitutes.</p>

<p>Substitute blocks the item-removing aspect of Knock Off. Substitute does not block the secondary effects of Rapid Spin.</p>
