Overview
########

- Although the newly introduced fairy type nerfed dragon types, Zekrom actually improved a lot during the generation shift
- unlike most dragons and special attacks, Zekroms strongest STAB option, Bolt Strike, was not nerfed
- the slower, yet still offensively inclined metagame is a not as hostile to Zekrom as the B/W meta
- With the rising popularity of Ho-Oh and Lugia as well as Yveltal, Zekrom serves as a fine check to all of those pokes
- With most of the metagame specially oriented, Zekrom is also one of the premier physical attackers
- Zekrom can fulfill roles as a mixed attacker, Choice Band/Scarf user also has some utility moves like Volt Switch, Substitute and Tailwind in its movepool
- Furthermore, Zekrom cannot be paralyzed, which is huge on Scarf/Tailwind sets
- that said, Zekrom, especially choiced variants are incredibly reliant on prediction sometimes, since there are immunities to both of its STABs now
- No boosting moves outside of Hone Claws
- Base 90 is still a bad speed tier by uber's standards
- Gained an additional weakness to fairy type moves

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Volt Switch / Dragon Claw
move 4: Dragon Claw / Draco Meteor / Sleep Talk
ability: Teravolt
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Naughty / Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

- Bolt Strike is a strong STAB option that hits many popular threats in the X/Y meta for super effective damage
- Outrage is a strong and reliable move that lets Zekrom clean late game if the opponent's dragon check (fairy types in particular) has been removed
- The presence of Outrage forces people to keep their fairy type or a bulky steel type alive
- Volt Switch to keep momentum
- Dragon Claw is a better option than Outrage early game. Draco Meteor hits Arceus Ground for about the same damage while hitting Groudon slightly harder. Sleep Talk is nice if you want Zekrom to be your sleep absorber. The last two moves, however, tend to make you Mega Gengar fodder.
- Naive / Hasty / Jolly allows Scarf Zekrom to outspeed Deoxys-A but doesn't do anything outside of that

Set Details
========
- Max Attack to hit as hard as possible
- Max Speed is important to be able to speed tie with opposing base 90 Scarfers late game (Kyogre and Zekrom in particular)
- Attack boosting nature ensures the 2HKO vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Arceus: 222-262 (50 - 59%)
- Running Sleep Talk lets you switch into Dakrai very easily
- EVs can be shifted into SpA to give DM more power, although you generally want to keep max speed

Usage Tips
========

- Really, just click the appropriate move and watch things get decimated
- Prediction is VERY important because of all the immunities around
- That said, once your opponent sees what you've locked yourself into, it's easy to play around Zekrom

Team Options
========

- Kyogre can handle Groudon and Groundceus well. Kyogre and Zekrom can also take many hits aimed at the other
- Hzard support is nice - Ferrothorn, Skamory, and Forretress can take Dragon and Fairy-type attacks aimed at Zekrom
- Mega Gengar works well as it is able to trap and kill fairies - before mega evolving, Gengar is also immune to Ground-type attacks, acting as a one time switch in allowing it to evolve
 
Other Options
########
- Choice Band
- Mixed Attacker
- Tailwind Support
- Substitute
- Hone Claws
- Roost
- Hopefully some other moves it gets in X/Y
- Dragon Tail can be used on the Mixed set to force opposing switch ins like groundon into KO range of DM easier
