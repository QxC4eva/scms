Overview
########
- Unique typing gives it a 4x water resistance and an unrivalled role as a Kyogre check. Neutrality to most types and only 2 weaknesses is a nice plus.
- Base 100 Speed lets it outpace the numerous base 90-99s that populate Ubers
- Great Base 150 SpA complemented by quality STABs and the necessary coverage moves confer huge offensive prowess on it
- This blend of typing, speed, and power make it one of the most defining Pokemon of the tier with few, if any real flaws. Functions as a glue to many teams
- Has a usable support movepool comprising status, phazing, and Rest. This, in tandem with a good base 120 SpD, allow it to use a defensive set to good effect
- The newly introduced Fairies are not good news for it. (Geomancy) Xerneas stands out among these as a key threat
- All its commonly used attacking options bar Spacial Rend got nerfed
- Can still be exploited by threats with superior power and speed, with a couple of new additions in Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Blaziken

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Spacial Rend
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Thunder / Thunder Wave / Rest
ability: Pressure
item: Lustrous Orb / Assault Vest / Leftovers
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
- Hydro Pump is strong STAB; boosted by Lustrous Orb and coming off base 150 SpA it hits neutral targets considerably hard. Rain skyrockets its damage output.
- Spacial Rend is Palkia's second STAB option, complementing Hydro Pump in providing excellent neutral coverage; it also hits opposing Palkia, Giratina, and Rayquaza super effectively and is a consistent, fairly powerful move
- Fire Blast is mandatory coverage against the numerous Steel-types in the tier, notably Ferrothorn, which resists both of Palkia's STABs
- Thunder hits Kyogre, Water Arceus, and Lugia super effectively. While the 30% chance of paralysis should not be counted on, it is high enough to be significant.
- Thunder Wave is excellent for crippling Arceus switch-ins and preventing setup from the likes of overeager Geomancy Xerneas/some CM Arceus formes
- Rest grants Palkia more longevity and sustainability as a Kyogre check and works particularly well in tandem with cleric support and Leftovers
- Surf can be used if Hydro Pump's accuracy is a problem but the power drop is significant
- Draco Meteor can be used over Spacial Rend as a stronger Dragon-type move that notably ensures a KO on opposing Assault Vest Palkia, can KO 0 HP Groudon outright (37.5% chance, 75% after SR), and proves situationally more useful against opposing Arceus switch-ins; however, the SpA drop can be taken advantage of by opportunistic setup sweepers. The consistency of Spacial Rend is generally more appreciated.
- Slot 4: Dragon Tail phazes switch-ins, racking up residual hazard damage. This should ideally be used with Assault Vest. Toxic is an option for crippling walls and pressuring opposing support Arceus.

Set Details
========
- Max Spd and SpA with a Timid nature to make the best of its Speed tier and hit as hard as possible
- Lustrous Orb gives Palkia's STABs a much-welcomed power boost (calcs)
- Assault Vest allows Palkia to stomach special attacks, especially from the likes of Kyogre, much more comfortably. The inability to use non-attacking moves such as Thunder Wave must be taken into consideration, though. Notably, this makes Palkia more prone to setup sweepers. Dragon Tail can be run to phaze sweepers, but note that Fairies are immune to the move
- Leftovers gives Palkia a more wiggle room in switching in and increases its longevity somewhat. If Palkia is using Rest, Leftovers should definitely be used.
- Haban Berry can be used to allow Palkia to beat other Palkia 1v1, although in a metagame where Dragon-type attacks are less prominent, this is now a lesser option

Usage Tips
========
- Switch Palkia in on Kyogre, especially early-midgame, to scout its set and minimise damage done to the team. It's likely going to be the only thing that's 4x Water-resistant on your team; make use of that. Don't get cocksure with predictions till lategame, when you might then want to capitalise on predicted Thunders/Ice Beams by switching into other Pokemon
- Don't switch Palkia in rashly on anything else especially if you see Kyogre in Team Preview, you don't want it to be unable to check Kyogre when you need it to. For example, it's a bad idea switching Palkia into Landorus-T's Earthquake, even if you can force it out afterward, because Palkia will now be in KO range by any of Kyogre's moves.
- Spam Palkia's STAB Hydro Pump when it can force something out, especially if the opponent's Arceus form is unrevealed and he does not have an obvious Palkia check (Blissey, Sylveon) in Team Preview. This can be a good way to get the opponent to reveal his Arceus form early game as few other things are really able to stomach Palkia's STAB Hydro Pump. Using Thunder Wave to catch these Arceus on the switch is also a good idea
- Palkia's moves are quite weather-dependent. Hydro Pump and Thunder are best used under rain, while Fire Blast can be used in any weather but. Try to manipulate the weather to your advantage with your teammates for optimum effectiveness.

Team Options
========
- Palkia is a very self-sufficient Pokemon with its blend of power, coverage, and speed, such that it requires relatively little team support... With that said, many Pokemon are good teammates to have
- Teammates to deal with Fairies are required. Steel-types like Scizor and Heatran are good choices, as is Ho-Oh
- A Ground-type is good to deal with (Scarf) Zekrom, which can come in to revenge kill Palkia. Groudon is a good option, as are Landorus-T/Gliscor. These can also set SR, and Groudon brings sun that boosts Palkia's Fire Blast
- Kyogre is a good teammate as Drizzle gives Hydro Pump a 1.5x power boost + makes Thunder 100% accurate (mention how water spam is pretty effective this gen and having 2 users of powerful Water-type moves is a good thing)
- Have a teammate(s) that can take advantage of Blissey, a hard counter to Palkia. Ho-Oh does this, as do powerful physical attackers like MMX
- Have a good switch in to all Mewtwo; they threaten Palkia massively with superior Speed and powerful STAB moves. Fairy Arceus and Xerneas can deal with MMX, while Yveltal and Giratina-O can handle MMY/LO Mewtwo
- Answers to common support Arceus formes like Fairy, Water, Grass, and Ghost, and answers to common CM Arceus like Electric, Ghost, and Fairy are required
- An Arceus of your own is good to deal with opposing Palkia. Fairy and Ghost Arceus are good for this purpose; these also help with Mewtwo
- Mega Gengar can remove Fairies, support Arceus formes, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Blissey not carrying Shed Shell, aiding a Palkia cleanup late-game

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Surf / Spacial Rend
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Thunder Wave / Fire Blast
move 4: Rest
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========
- Surf is this set's most consistent mono-attacking option, hitting most Pokemon neutrally. Super effective coverage on Grounds/Ho-Oh/Heatran is nice
- Toxic, in tandem with Rest, allows Palkia to pressure (and win 1v1) many common support Arceus formes such as Rock, Water, and Ghost Arceus
- Thunder Wave cripples setup sweepers like Geomancy Xerneas. Dual status can be viably run on Palkia and can catch the opponent off guard
- Rest gives Palkia the longevity it needs; it is a necessity on this set, which prioritises staying power over offensive presence
- Spacial Rend and Fire Blast can be used in slots 1 and 3 over Surf and Thunder Wave, letting Palkia forgo its STAB and secondary status move for good all-round coverage that lets it get past Steels as well as pick off weakened things and retain a reliable STAB move
- Dragon Tail could be run as move 3 to ensure CM Arceus that have already accrued boosts when you switch in do not overwhelm you, though Palkia finds it difficult to accommodate the move. Sleep Talk can also be run in this moveslot to allow Palkia to spread status even while asleep.

Set Details
========
- The EV spread maximises Palkia's special bulk and works well with Palkia's neutrality to most types. Scarf Kyogre is doing a maximum of 29% to this set with Thunder. Judgment from a type-neutral 4 SpA Arceus does a maximum of 30%
- Leftovers is a mandatory item to prolong Palkia's lifespan and let it live through its Rest turns

Usage Tips
========
- This is a prime check to Kyogre, so switch it in aggressively against that
- With its EV spread, Toxic, and Rest, Palkia now fares well against most common support Arceus barring Fairy Arceus, so switch it in against these as well. Hazard support should be employed to further pressure switchins
- Try not to let Palkia sustain any unecessary damage otherwise, as Rest isn't exactly reliable recovery and Palkia should be as healthy as possible to tackle the listed threats, of which checks to are in short supply. Letting it get hit by Earthquake/Psystrike/Brave Bird unecessarily will leave it too crippled to perform its role effectively later in the game
 
Team Options
========
- Hazard support to make the best of this set's ability to deal with common support Arceus. SR also checks Ho-Oh, which is otherwise a threatening Pokemon to this set
- Teammates to deal with Fairies: Steels, Ho-Oh, Mega Gengar
- Cleric support is much-appreciated as it works great in conjunction with Rest. Fairy-types are friend as much as foe: Sylveon and Xerneas are reliable clerics that can also handle opposing Palkia and wall Dragon-type attacks this set is vulnerable to
- Ground-type to handle Zekrom
- Checks to Mewtwo and its Mega Evolutions
- Check to opposing Palkia; again, a support Arceus form is good
- A check to strong physical attackers/sweepers is required. Landorus-T can check Extreme Killer/SD Groundceus and also set SR + handle Zekrom. Ghost Arceus/Giratina-O can handle Ekiller + Mewtwo

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Draco Meteor / Spacial Rend
move 3: Thunder / Spacial Rend
move 4: Fire Blast / Spacial Rend
ability: Pressure
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spd
nature: Timid

Moves
========
- Hydro Pump hits very hard with Choice Specs equipped; doing 57%-68% to 248 HP Arceus. Having no immunities, it is Palkia's most spammable move
- Draco Meteor is a nuke but the SpA drop can be capitalised upon. Spacial Rend is a weaker, more consistent Dragon STAB. In most cases, Draco Meteor is the preferred option as Choice Specs Palkia is by and large a hit-and-run Pokemon anyway, but Spacial Rend has certain advantages such as pressuring Grass Arceus switch-ins more effectively. Note that Fairies are immune to Dragon-type moves regardless
- Thunder hits Kyogre, Water Arceus, and Lugia. The power boost from Specs makes it very damaging against these Pokemon, hence making it a rather useful move on this set
- Fire Blast handles Steel-types barring Heatran. It also allows Palkia to get past Grass Arceus under neutral or sunny weather
- Spacial Rend can be run in slots 3 or 4 if Draco Meteor is used as move 2. Fire Blast is not a necessity on this set as Grass Arceus can be kept in check with Spacial Rend. Steel-types are KOed by Specs Hydro Pump anyway; Ferrothorn can be overwhelmed under rain

Set Details
========
- Maximum Spd and SpA with a Timid nature to hit as hard and fast as possible. This spread is fairly straightforward and non-negotiable
- Choice Specs allows Palkia to pressure/beat some of its would-be checks, notably support Arceus formes and bulky Fairies

Usage Tips
========
- Spam Hydro Pump most of the time as it 2HKOs practically all neutral targets barring Blissey and will punish type-neutral Arceus formes that attempt to switch in. Try to have rain active when doing this; the power boost is very significant
- Having hazards up is also a great way to further pressure switch-ins and soften up the opponent's team for a cleanup by a sweeper/Scarfed Pokemon
- Dragon spam is no longer as effective as it used to be; a simple switch into a Fairy-type can reverse your momentum. Be prudent in spamming Spacial Rend/Draco Meteor
- Under sun, spamming Fire Blast would be the way to go over Hydro Pump spam
- Try to bring it in via double switches; this set's main aim is still to check Kyogre and it is not wise to let it sustain unecessary damage. Status is also very debilitating for this set; paralysis destroys its speed advantage and burn/poison wears away at it

Team Options
========
If anything, a solid answer to Fairies is more necessary than ever here due to this set's inability to switch moves. Aegislash and Heatran are good examples of such teammates. Mega Gengar is another great teammate in this regard

Other Options
########
- Choice Scarf: A Choice Scarf set with the same moveset as the Choice Specs set can be run. This set has lost much of its appeal this gen, predominantly due to the opportunity cost of not using one of the other sets. The presence of Fairies severely impairs the effectiveness of spamming Scarf Dragon-type moves. As a revenge killer, it faces tough competition from Scarf Kyogre and Zekrom, as well as new options in Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal. It still retains a niche due to its speed tier, can act as a glue of sorts due to its typing and speed, as well as being a good measure against Sticky Web teams, but is a lackluster set overall
- An offensive Trick Room set can be used with a Quiet nature. This allows Palkia to outspeed anything above 212 Speed under Trick Room; this works nicely with its great coverage and high Special Attack. However, this is somewhat counterproductive given Palkia's speed tier. This set should really only be used if one's team has multiple members who benefit from Trick Room
- Focus Punch on the offensive set to deal with Blissey
- Roseli Berry
- Chesto Berry

Checks & Counters
########

**Blissey**: The pink blob is the best hard counter to Palkia one can get. Choice Specs Hydro Pump in rain is merely a 3HKO on 252 HP/252 SpD Blissey with a Calm nature. With its gargantuan Special Defense, reliable recovery in Softboiled/Wish, and access to Toxic, Blissey is guaranteed to beat Palkia in a one-on-one situation and can switch in on it quite handily.

**Fairy-types**: These are a pain for Palkia to get around as they are immune to its Dragon STAB moves. Fairy Arceus, with its superior speed and good natural bulk, takes 46%-54% from a Lustrous Orb Hydro Pump in neutral weather, meaning it can switch into one comfortably enough and proceed to force Palkia out with the threat of a super effective Judgment. Xerneas does not like switching into Palkia, but one-on-one, it can KO Palkia with STAB Moonblast or set up a Geomancy on it. Bulkier Fairy-types like Sylveon and Clefable can stall Palkia out of Hydro Pump PP with Wish and Protect, and proceed to overwhelm it with their STAB moves.

**Type-Neutral Arceus Formes**: Arceus formes that take neutral damage from Palkia's attacks can check it provided it is not raining. These consist of Electric, Ghost, Fighting, Dark, and Psychic Arceus. They can all switch into any of Palkia's moves and overcome it with Recover and Judgment. Electric and Ghost Arceus are commonly seen using Calm Mind sets; these are more threatening as they can set up Calm Mind on Palkia if it chooses to stay in. However, note that most Arceus formes are vulnerable to status, and while they can generally overcome offensive Palkia, they will fall to specially defensive Palkia one-on-one. Extreme Killer Arceus can set up a Swords Dance on all Palkia and threaten a sweep afterward.

**Mewtwo**: STAB Psystrike from Mewtwo or Mega Mewtwo Y targets Palkia's weaker Defense stat and will cleanly 2HKO it, or even KO outright if Palkia has taken prior damage (252 SpA Psystrike from Mega Mewtwo Y with a Timid nature does 70%-81% to offensive Palkia). STAB Low Kick from Mega Mewtwo X is even more damaging, doing a minimum of 81% to offensive Palkia. While none of them can switch into Palkia's STAB moves comfortably, they can all do so in a pinch, and are especially deadly as revenge killers.

**Dialga**: The only Dragon-type that takes neutral damage from other Dragon-type moves, specially defensive Dialga can take 2 Spacial Rends and KO back with Draco Meteor. Other variants of Dialga can take a Spacial Rend comfortably and KO back as well.

**Shadow Tag**: Mega Gengar can trap Palkia and force a double KO with Destiny Bond; this is especially detrimental for the Palkia user as he loses his Kyogre check, hence Mega Gengar deserves mention as something Palkia must look out for as it can be extremely threatening especially if paired with Pokemon like Kyogre. Gothitelle, albeit rare, can trap and set up on specially defensive Palkia. Wobbuffet can trap and KO offensive Palkia with Mirror Coat, and Encore specially defensive Palkia into a support move that can then be taken advantage of.

**Revenge Killing**: Choice Scarf Zekrom and Choice Scarf Xerneas stand out among these, as they are relatively commonly seen and can 1HKO Palkia with their STAB moves. Mega Blaziken with Protect is very dangerous as well. Other lesser-seen Choice Scarf users like Dialga and Yveltal are threatening as well.

(the following checks are inconsistent as they are quite weather-dependent)

**Grass Arceus**: Grass Arceus can check offensive Palkia only in rainy weather, and can beat it one-on-one in neutral weather. Specially defensive Palkia will come out on top of it, though.

**Lugia**: Barely avoiding the 2HKO from Thunder, Lugia theoretically checks Palkia in neutral and sunny weather, with a combination of Toxic, Roost, and Thunder's poor accuracy. However, Thunder's 30% Paralysis rate, coupled with the fact it is inadvisable for Lugia to be EVed to outspeed offensive Palkia, mean it is a shaky check at best and should only ever be counted on under sun.

**Water Arceus**: Like Lugia, Water Arceus only wants to check Palkia in sunny weather, as Thunder from offensive Palkia can 2HKO it, and its 30% paralysis chance is too high to be ignored. Also, Palkia is 4x resistant to its STAB Judgment. Calm Mind Water Arceus with Refresh is much more dangerous, as it can accrue multiple boosts while shrugging off damage and status with Recover and Refresh, eventually overwhelming Palkia. It can also set up on specially defensive Palkia, unless most other Arceus formes.

**Aegislash**: Only barely checks Palkia in neutral weather; rain-boosted Hydro Pump and sun-boosted Fire Blast are too damaging it for it to handle. Also, it cannot to much to Palkia short of Toxic-stalling it

**Ferrothorn** The steel durian is only able to check Palkia with a combination of Leech Seed and Protect if it is raining; Fire Blast being 4x effective on it prevents it from doing so in any other weather
