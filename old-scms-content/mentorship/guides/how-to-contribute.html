<p>Some say the best way to get involved is to jump right in. Others prefer guidance, but for those who want to contribute to the community straight away, these are the easiest ways!</p>

<h2>Tier Forums</h2>
<p>One of the easiest ways to make your mark on here is by being a great battler. It's not exactly contributing for the most part, but it's at least showing that you're pretty good at Pok&eacute;mon, which Smogon respects. If you're really good, you can participate in suspect tests (which are posted in each forum whenever they're happening). If you can complete certain pre-requisites you may be selected to vote and potentially change the face of the tier you're involved in. You can find out more about these by checking out the tier you're most interested in.</p>

<h2>Tournaments</h2>
<p>Apart from actively playing in all kinds of tournaments, the best way for you to contribute to the Tournaments section is to host tournaments of your own (approved by our Tournament Director staff, of course). This isn't quite as simple as just throwing players into a bracket, though - a good host must be efficient, reliable, and a good communicator. If you have an idea for a tournament that you'd like to host, please make sure that it hasn't been done before by searching through the Tournament Listing here. If you'd like more information on what hosting a tournament requires, the TD staff have already put together a great guide located in the Tournament Rules and General Guidelines thread. It's located here under "Hosting", and it includes all of the sections afterward. Happy hosting!<p>

<h2>Battling 101</h2>
<p>If you're good at Pok&eacute;mon, then you could consider applying to become a tutor for Battling 101. You'd need to be known enough to an extent in order for your application to be successful (since you do need references). You can check out how to apply <a href="/tutor/apply_tutor">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Mentorship</h2>
<p>You can even contribute to the community in this forum. We have a simple questions sticky which you can reply to and help out with, you can <a href="/forums/threads/how-to-become-a-mentor.3523494/">become a mentor</a>, or you can simply welcome someone in the introduction thread, since all everyone really wants is to feel welcome!</p>

<h2>Rate My Team</h2>
<p>RMT stands for Rate My Team, and is the name of a subforum where you can look to improve your teams, or help fellow users improve their teams. There exist sections for every official Smogon tier, which means the RMT subforum can be used by everyone, no matter what tier you prefer to play. Contributing to the section is simple; as mentioned above, it is possible to both post a team that needs development, and rate other teams that are posted. However, there are a number of rules that apply when posting a team, and some general guidelines for rating teams. In addition to these rules and guidelines, there are a couple of smart tricks to make your RMT's and rates more pleasant to read; using a good format with pictures and readable text does a lot for the reader, and makes your post more appealing to reply to in general. When you fulfill these requirments, though, there is nothing hindering you from learning or teaching a lot about teambuilding, which is one of the most important aspects within competitive battling.</p>

<h2>Pok&eacute;mon Showdown</h2>
<p>If you love the server and spend a lot of time on there, you can contribute by becoming staff and helping the auth moderate the chat. Becoming staff isn't easy though and it does take time in order to prove that you have what it takes to be able to lead the chat. Luckily Darnell has guides to help make things easier, explaining how to obtain <a href="/player/issue3/promotion-guide-voice">voice</a> and <a href="/player/issue4/promotion-guide-driver">driver</a>.</p>

<h2>Wifi</h2>
<p>There's a few ways you can contribute to wifi. People always love free Pok&eacute;mon and if you have some spare, the giveaways section will definitely appreciate your time and effort. You can also make people happy by replying to <a href="/forums/threads/...item-requests-etc-go-here-no-hacking.3522448/">the simple questions thread</a> and helping them get an item or something.</p>

<h2>Orange Islands</h2>
<p>If you're amazing with Pok&eacute;mon in-game, then Orange Islands might be for you. You can contribute in a variety of ways. There's always new things that can be researched, especially when a new game comes out. Just check out what the current things are that need researching and you're all good. You can also help out in either of the simple questions threads <a href="/forums/threads/...aq-in-first-post-read-before-posting.3523153/">here</a>and <a href="/forums/threads/have-a-question-ask-it-here.3476944/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Sixth Generation Contributions</h2>
<p>If you have technical ability, Contributions &amp; Corrections is looking for people like you. First off, you need to check out <a href="/forums/threads/html-primer-updated-2009-10-16.32432/">this</a> and <a href="/forums/threads/smogon-html-101-the-utter-basics.3477029/">this</a> before going any further. Once an article or letter has reached the GP phase, it is ready for HTMLing, and the first person to gets to it is the one that gets to do the HTML. Again, be sure to check differences in HTMLing for Smogon, as there are numerous elements of the content management system that reduce the workload required. If your technical ability goes a bit further and you've created some sort of program that might be helpful for competitive battlers, show it off in the <a href="/forums/forums/technical-projects.107/">Projects subforum</a>! Competitive battlers are always looking for the next cool applet. All of this is the Contributions &amp; Corrections subforum; there is sure to be something you can help with.</p>

<p>If you demonstrate proficiency in a certain metagame through your posts within a metagame's analyses subforum, you may be able to join the Quality Control team of that metagame and ensure the analyses of others are concise and informative. If you want to check grammar, try applying for the Grammar-Prose team (look at <a href="/smog/issue17/gp">this guide</a> for some tips). Just remember to prove your abilities before requesting to join these teams, as you will otherwise be summarily rejected.</p>

<p>If you're an aspiring writer, or feel you know a lot about a specific Pok&eacute;mon, then writing analyses might be for you. The process may seem intimidating but there's a lot of guides you can follow in order to know what to do. These threads <a href="/forums/threads/welcome-to-c-c-a-beginners-guide-to-contributing.3500343/">here</a> and <a href="/forums/threads/smogon-writing-101-getting-started-and-writing-tips.3476887/">here</a> will help you.</p>

<p>GP stands for Grammar Prose and is a crucial step in the analysis progress. During this stage, GP members look over your now written analysis and check for all grammar errors. These posts are usually color coordinated and tell the user exactly what to remove and what to add. GP members are accepted through filling out an application, but anyone can provide checks; checks from unofficial GP members are called amchecks. However, never copy and paste a check over your analysis; this will cause more errors in your works then if you didn't implement the check at all! There are two main methods of implementing GP checks, the first being simply looking through the check and updating the opening post! The second way is a bit more complicated to get a grasp on at first, but is a much more efficient way of implementing checks. To do this method, simply quote the check and begin removing all of the things the checker says to remove, this is where the color coordination comes in. For example, deleting everything red in your analysis is usually what you will be doing. From here, you can select all and click the remove all text formatting option; now you've got a copy paste version of the check! This is how I personally implement GP checks and I find it to be much more time-saving than other methods. Every analysis receives two GP checks, and afterwords this analysis is done! This stage is the final stage in the process before your analysis is shiny and ready for upload! These two threads <a href="/forums/threads/grammar-dojo-see-post-61.3508366/">here</a> and <a href="/forums/threads/spelling-and-grammar-standards.3490681/">here</a> should help you out.</p>

<h2>The Smog, The Competitor and The Player</h2>
<p>These are Smogon's three e-zines and they are always looking for more contributors. If you know Pok&eacute;mon, the tournament scene or PS, then you're going to fit in just fine in these e-zines.</p>

<p>The Player is the Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! webzine, dedicated to the publication of content that highlights the various facets of PS!, from server-exclusive metagames to the rooms you, as players, chat and battle in. The Player differs from other webzines such as The Smog, which focuses on primarily Smogon-related content, and The Competitor, which revels in the latest in official and user-hosted tournament news. There's a plethora of ways to contribute to The Player, from writing articles to creating art or coding. If you're a writer interested in becoming an author, you simply need to come up with a topic that is relevant to Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! in some fashion and create a thread in the Article Submissions subforum. At that point, a Player staff member will review your submission and approve or decline it from there. If you're approved, you will gain access to a new subforum to begin the writing your article. If you want to contribute art to The Player, this requires messaging a Player staff member a few sample pieces for approval. If you're more interested in coding for The Player, you should message Vacate asking for an HTML screening. Lastly, you can also contribute ideas if you're a brainstormer more than you're an author. Message your ideas for articles to a Player staff member and, if they're decent and have yet to be written, they will be included in a conglomerate of potential ideas. There are other ways to contribute to the success of The Player such as grammar checking, but this can only be done by official Grammar Prose team members. If you're interested in the Grammar Prose team, read this thread. Player staff members that can be contacted for more information include <a href="/forums/members/vacate.189371/">Vacate</a>, <a href="/forums/members/shaymin.178207/">shaymin</a>, <a href="/forums/members/antemortem.192841/">Antemortem</a>, and <a href="/forums/members/spydreigon.169106/">Spydreigon</a>.</p>

<p>If you're good at writing about a specific topic, then cool, we really need you. If you're on the grammar team we will definitely need you. If you're a HTMLer you're just as valuable, we need you. And if you're an artist, you're pretty rare and will likely be bombarded with love (not to say the other positions aren't as important, but artists are a lot harder to find). The following threads <a href="/forums/threads/...aspiring-contributors-inquire-within.3471473/">here</a>, <a href="/forums/threads/how-to-get-involved.3503726/">here</a>, and <a href="/forums/threads/how-to-contribute-to-the-player.3524389/">here</a> will explain how to really get involved.</p>

<h2>Social Media</h2>
<p>If you have Twitter, Facebook, Twitch, Youtube... any of these accounts, you can pretty much help out Smogon. We want the word to get out there that Smogon is the #1 competitive Pok&eacute;mon site, and that can only be done with the help of dedicated Smogoners. Showing your Pok&eacute;mon knowledge through Smogcasts, or tweeting about important tier related changes, or even just streaming gameplay is all important, as it helps share knowledge with people who aren't as involved in the site. It's a lot easier than scrolling through the site!</p>

<p>Smogon has it's own YouTube channel for members of the community to sit down and watch whenever they want. Videos contributed to the channel are mainly made from users willing to dedicate their time to help entertain many of our channel subscribers and for those who want to be educated on what is happening with Smogon. If you feel you would like to contribute to the Smogon YouTube channel, it is simple. Firstly, create a video (If you do not have any ideas, watch some videos on the channel or feel free to PM Zodiax or Ace Emerald.) Secondly, upload the file onto www.mediafire.com or www.dropbox.com. These are both free websites and the sign-up takes seconds. Lastly, PM <a href ="/forums/members/zodiax.202547/">Zodiax</a> and <a href="/forums/members/ace-emerald.43686/">Ace Emerald</a> the video file from either website for both of them to review and give some feedback. When it is up to satisfaction it will then be uploaded to the channel!</p>

<p>For more information on how to contribute to the other two areas, look <a href="/forums/threads/smogon-affiliated-twitter-accounts.3515633/">here</a> and <a href="/forums/threads/want-to-write-for-the-facebook-page-look-here.3509023/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Create a Pok&eacute;mon</h2>
<p>Wanna build a snowman? Or help create a brand new concept? You can help out with Smogon's Create a Pok&eacute;mon program. You can read more about it <a href="/cap/process/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Art</h2>
<p>Are you an artist? Or even an aspiring one? If you're either of these, you can contribute art to the community and make the site a lot more flashier. There's a few ways you can get involved (and you can unofficially start off making art for tournaments and threads if you want) which you can read about <a  href="/forums/threads/...-guide-to-contributing-art-to-smogon.3488041/">here</a>.</p>

<p>For all of these we have a related badge that you can earn if you're really good at what you do. You can read more about the badges <a href="/badge_faq">here</a>.</p>

--

<p>Once you have a badge you can contribute to Inside Scoop, which is Smogon's badgeholder-only section, where you can help change the shape of the site by giving direct feedback and suggestions to upper staff as well as contribute to threads posted there. Another thing you can do as a badgeholder is contribute to the on-site content. There's a guide as to how to use the SCMS in Inside Scoop. If you're really helpful with the SCMS, constantly updating things, you may be nominated for site staff and if you complete Oglemi's HTML test you may be able to update information on-site without having to wait for someone to cache it. New badgeholders will also be nominated in Inside Scoop where users can comment on whether they are suited for the badge or not.</p>

<p>You can also become a moderator of Smogon by actively contributing to the forum you care the most about. If there's a staff vacancy and you go above and beyond what the normal user would be doing, then you may be able to become a moderator of the forum, and help improve it. You could also get project mods (which have limited powers, meaning you can only edit, lock and do the basic mod commands) if you contribute a lot to a forum but you're not quite ready for the moderator title.</p>

<p>That's about the basics of how to contribute. There's a few other ways to contribute to Smogon but I'll leave that up to you!</p>
