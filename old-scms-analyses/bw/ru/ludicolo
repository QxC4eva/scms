[Overview]

<p>Ludicolo is a staple of rain teams in RU mostly because of its partial Grass typing, which gives the dancing duck the ability to mow through many common bulky Water-types that usually wall rain teams. In addition, Ludicolo possesses lightning-fast Speed in rain thanks to Swift Swim, and is in general an all-around solid Pokemon. However, Ludicolo does suffer a bit from its rather unimpressive 70 / 90 attacking stats, with Swords Dance being the only option to increase its middling Attack stat.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ludicolo has an extremely solid movepool, which allows it to hit most of the common RU Pokemon with its two STABs and clear away many common answers to rain teams. Hydro Pump and Surf are the main moves competing for Ludicolo's primary STAB option. In general, Hydro Pump should be used if power is more important, whereas Surf provides greater overall reliability. However, due to the extremely offensive oriented nature of the rain teams that Ludicolo often finds itself on, Hydro Pump is usually a superior option to Surf, as its significantly greater power allows Ludicolo to get the most out of the few turns of rain it has available.</p>

<p>Giga Drain is an interesting new addition to Ludicolo's (competitive) movepool this generation. Thanks to its increase in power from previous generations, it's now a superior option to Energy Ball or Grass Knot; it is only slightly weaker, but also allows Ludicolo to recover large portions of its HP. This especially helps Ludicolo against the many common priority moves in the tier. Ice Beam fits well into the third slot on this set, enabling Ludicolo to eliminate bulky Grass- and Flying-types. Finally, Rain Dance rounds off the set in order to set up a few extra turns to sweep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs allow Ludicolo to outspeed everything up to +1 positive-natured base 95s, most notably Lilligant and Primeape. Ludicolo doesn't hit many important Speed tiers by investing significantly more in Speed, other than Choice Scarf Galvantula. However, this much Speed investment usually isn't worth it as Ludicolo would need to run a Timid nature, and the drop in power is clearly noticeable. In a similar vein, because Ludicolo needs all the power it can get, Life Orb is the preferred option on this set. Damp Rock is also a viable item, though it too is not recommended.</p>

<p>Naturally, Ludicolo pairs extremely well with other Swift Swim Pokemon and Rain Dance setters, due to the fact that bulky Water-types typically have trouble with it. However, Ludicolo does fail to eliminate some common rain checks, such as Ferroseed, as well as many dedicated special walls, such as Cryogonal, especially if you choose not to run Focus Blast. Therefore, it should be be paired with Pokemon capable of removing those threats, such as Kabutops and Omastar, who both fit easily onto rain teams.</p>

[SET]

move 2: Waterfall

ability: Swift Swim
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Swords Dance Ludicolo is much less common than specially based Ludicolo simply due to Ludicolo's significantly higher Special Attack. However, Ludicolo has an interesting toy in the form of Swords Dance, which allows it to hit an incredible 524 Attack and lets it break through almost all of its common switch-ins.</p>

<p>Swords Dance is the crux of the set, powering up Ludicolo's otherwise weak base 70 Attack to sky-high levels. Waterfall and Seed Bomb, Ludicolo's main STAB moves, form the core of the set, with the former receiving a significant boost from rain. Finally, the last slot on Ludicolo's moveset is entirely up to personal preference; Ice Punch decimates Torterra, Lilligant, and other bulky Grass-types, Zen Headbutt mainly hits Qwilfish and Weezing, and Drain Punch fells Ferroseed and provides some recovery.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set's EVs allow Ludicolo to outspeed positive-natured +1 base 95s in rain. However, unlike specially based Ludicolo sets, this set cannot afford to run more Speed in order to outspeed faster threats. Ludicolo really needs all the offensive power it can get, because even with Swords Dance, Ludicolo's Attack is still rather lacking, especially considering that it's been boosted.</p>

<p>The best partners for this set are, again, other Swift Swim sweepers and bulky Rain Dance inducers. Kabutops, Omastar, and Gorebyss all fill the former role; Kabutops benefits from Ludicolo weakening physical walls, while Omastar and Gorebyss can exploit Ludicolo's luring in and eliminating special walls. In terms of Rain Dance support, Uxie, Altaria, and Drifblim are all solid options capable of providing support in some way other than just Rain Dance (Heal Bell, for example).</p>

[SET]
name: SubSeed
move 1: Leech Seed
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Scald / Ice Beam
item: Leftovers
ability: Rain Dish
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Ludicolo's great defensive stats and few weaknesses. Ludicolo can set up on weaker support Pokemon, namely bulky Water-types, as well as resisted Choice-locked moves. This set can be used with or without rain support, but when rain is provided, Ludicolo has the potential to recover 25% of its health per turn, which counterbalances the health lost from Substitute. Toxic is used to cripple Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed, and it also helps wear down bulkier opponents. Ludicolo's STAB Scald has a nifty 30% burn rate which could potentially cripple physical attackers, while Ice Beam hits Grass-types and most Flying-types, such as Mandibuzz, super effectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are tailored to boost Ludicolo's physical bulk, as it already has a decent Special Defense stat. Swift Swim can be used if you want a faster, more offensive Ludicolo, or you can tweak the EVs to give Ludicolo more special bulk with a Calm nature. Protect can be used over Toxic for extra stalling capabilities, but this leaves Ludicolo helpless against most Grass-types. Finally, Giga Drain is a second STAB option that pairs well with Substitute, and is useful for quickly restoring large amounts of health.</p>

<p>Toxic Spikes are helpful to wear down the opponent, and they work excellently in tandem with Protect and Substitute. Entry hazards are helpful in general, as this set will cause a lot of switches. Drapion can set up Toxic Spikes and Taunt the opponent, Ferroseed can set up Spikes and Stealth Rock, and Sandslash can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards. Remember, when using entry hazards, carry a Ghost-type such as Rotom on your team to block Rapid Spin. Clefable is an excellent partner for this set as it can abuse Encore to give Ludicolo an easier switch in, and provides Wish support.</p>

<p>Faster opponents that carry Substitute generally ruin this strategy, and Ludicolo doesn't have the attacking power to break them without any investment. To combat this, a Taunt user can prevent the use of Substitute, while a phazer can force opponents off the field. Ferroseed is another problem for this set, mainly because Ludicolo can't touch it with any of the listed moves, and Ferroseed can use this time to set up. Magneton can trap Ferroseed with Magnet Pull, and Hidden Power Fire will make short work of it.</p>

<p>If you decide to use Scald in last slot, it may be worth pairing Ludicolo with Pokemon that can remove Grass-types. Fire-types such as Entei, Bug-types such as Scyther, and Flying-types such as Mandibuzz are all excellent partners. Finally, the last thing to consider are Pokemon who can cover Ludicolo's weaknesses. Archeops resists the Flying-, Bug-, and Poison-type moves aimed at Ludicolo, who can easily sponge any Water-type moves intended for Archeops in return. Crustle is another good choice; it can switch into the Poison-type attacks aimed at Ludicolo, and also set up Spikes and Stealth Rock for your team.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive Tank
move 1: Scald / Hydro Pump
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Synthesis
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
ability: Rain Dish
nature: Modest
evs: 160 HP / 252 SpA / 96 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set focuses on Ludicolo's 4x resistance to Water-type moves, which allows it to be brought in safely against most Water-types in RU. With its above average base 90 Special Attack and access to a recovery move in form of Synthesis, it can act as a good check to Pokemon such as Omastar, Lanturn, and other Ludicolo. Ludicolo can also use Synthesis to heal recoil damage caused by Life Orb, if it is chosen as Ludicolo's item. Also, unlike the Rain Special Attacker, this Ludicolo set requires less team support, and can be used on nearly any team that struggles with the previously mentioned Water-types. Life Orb is the preferred item for this set, since it gives Ludicolo a considerable power boost, but Leftovers is also an option if the recoil damage from Life Orb is unappreciated. Giga Drain and Scald are used as Ludicolo's STAB moves; both are reliable, and the latter also has the chance to burn the opponent's Pokemon. However, Hydro Pump can be used over Scald for additional raw power, but it forfeits Scald's accuracy. Ice Beam rounds out Ludicolo's coverage, hitting the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist its STAB moves. Synthesis is used to heal Ludicolo, giving it more longevity. However, even with Synthesis to heal it, Ludicolo shouldn't be played as a defensive Pokemon, since most strong STAB moves, such as Crawdaunt's Crunch or Rotom's Thunderbolt, will still deal huge amounts of damage to it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Rain Dish is the superior ability on this set, as rain is only seen on dedicated Rain Dance teams, and the opponent's Swift Swim sweepers are most likely going to outrun Swift Swim Ludicolo anyways, since its Speed isn't fully invested. As such, recovery from Rain Dish is usually better. However, Swift Swim can be used on Ludicolo if you decide to run 252 Speed EVs or something close to that. This isn't a good idea though, since the loss in bulk is considerable. Also, 96 Speed EVs are enough for this set's purpose, allowing Ludicolo to outrun all Adamant Aggron and anything slower than that. Surf is an option over Scald or Hydro Pump, but it's completely outclassed by both, since it doesn't gain any important KOs over Scald, which has the added chance to burn the opponent's Pokemon. If more power is really desired, Hydro Pump is usually the superior option, though it has imperfect accuracy. If Ferroseed is a nuisance, either Hidden Power Fire or Focus Blast should be considered as an option over Ice Beam, but even without those moves, Ludicolo can easily beat Ferroseed one on one, making them an inferior option to Ice Beam.</p>

<p>Pokemon such as Clefable can easily defeat Ludicolo, as they don't take too much damage from its STAB moves and can overcome Scald's burns with Magic Guard and Heal Bell. Offensive teams usually have a harder time against Ludicolo due to its amazing coverage. Also, offensive teams have a more difficult time fitting one of the previously mentioned Pokemon on the team and so have to rely on either revenge killing Ludicolo or proper prediction, which is risky and might not always work. Pokemon that have good synergy with Ludicolo and benefit from its ability to defeat most Water-types in RU, such as Regirock and Moltres, are good partners for it. Last but not least, Ludicolo likes to have strong Fighting-type Pokemon such as Hariyama and Hitmonlee by its side, since they can easily take down most of the Pokemon with high Special Defense that bother Ludicolo while benefiting from its ability to counter Slowking, most teams' answer to the previously mentioned Fighting-types.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>While it is usually seen using only its STABs and an Ice-type coverage move, Ludicolo has a surprisingly large movepool. Rain Special Attacker Ludicolo can use Focus Blast or Hidden Power Fighting in order to break down Ferroseed. Swords Dance Ludicolo also has a bunch of other options worth consideration, such as ThunderPunch and Fake Out; however, the former doesn't really provide any additional coverage, while the latter simply wastes rain turns.</p>

<p>Ludicolo has a few other interesting options available to it. Most notably, the more gimmicky Counter, which can be used on a lead set in conjunction with Fake Out; however, this is rather inefficient due to Team Preview. Finally, Ludicolo can pull off some defensive sets reasonably well thanks to Haze.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>With it raining on the field, Ludicolo can be surprisingly difficult to counter, because despite its middling offenses, it still outspeeds everything and hits pretty hard with its STAB rain-boosted attacks. In general, however, most Pokemon with Water Absorb or those who resist Hydro Pump, and that can take a hit from Giga Drain as well, can check Ludicolo, though perhaps not very easily. For example, Poliwrath and Lanturn are both capable of switching in on anything other than Giga Drain from the Rain Special Attacker and subsequently force out or damage Ludicolo. In addition, many specially bulky Pokemon are capable of taking hits from Ludicolo. For example, Uxie and Cryogonal can take a few hits from Ludicolo, with the former paralyzing it with Thunder Wave while Cryogonal can Toxic Ludicolo or stall out the rain turns with Recover.</p>

<p>Swords Dance Ludicolo is a bit harder to handle. However, Tangrowth can wall it and either Sleep Powder or Power Whip the Mexican pineapple. In addition, after you've determined what coverage move Ludicolo is running, Ferroseed or Qwilfish can check it pretty easily as well, with Qwilfish being especially effective thanks to Intimidate.</p>

<p>Finally, Ludicolo really hates taking hits from strong priority, as its defenses are good but by no means excellent. Taking repeated hits from ExtremeSpeed and Sucker Punch from high-powered threats such as Entei and Absol will wear Ludicolo down extremely quickly.</p>
