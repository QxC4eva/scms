[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder is immune to Fire-type moves, and the power of the wielder's Fire-type moves by 50% when they are hit by a Fire-type move, regardless of whether the Fire-type move deals damage. Once the user is hit by a Fire-type move, Flash Fire activates. If the user is targeted by another Fire-type move after Flash Fire is activated, the user will be immune to the move but it receives no further boost. If the wielder loses Flash Fire by an ability-changing effect, the boost to Fire-type moves is lost and is not regained if Flash Fire is restored to the original wielder (until it is targeted by another Fire-type move).</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Flash Fire is a great ability. On teams that need to patch up a Fire-type weakness, Pokemon with this ability do a great job at doing so while also giving a big boost to their Fire-type moves. Activating Flash Fire under the sun makes for a devastating ability that inflicts massive damage, making Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/chandelure">Chandelure</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/heatran">Heatran</a> ridiculously powerful.</p>
