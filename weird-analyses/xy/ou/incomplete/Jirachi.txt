Overview
########

    Diverse movepool
    Malleable stats
    Serene Grace
    Good synergy with rain teams
    Uncommon typing
    King's Rock doesn't stack with Iron Head's flinch chance (so the 2.4% of you using it, you should probably stop).
    Steel nerf, multiple new mons/Mega evolutions that beat it, no more perma-rain and Knock Off buff hurt it
    Weak to common attacking types (Ghost, Fire, Ground, Dark)
    Often uses luck-based sets
    Sets tend to be rivaled by other mons (Togekiss for Parafusion, Genesect for Scarf, Chansey/Blissey for Wish, etc.)


Wishmaker
########
name: Wishmaker
move 1: Wish
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Thunder Wave/Body Slam
move 4: Healing Wish/U-turn/Stealth Rock/Protect
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 224 Def / 32 Spe

Moves
========

    Wish gives cleric abilities
    Iron Head allows Jirachi to flinch through its checks, namely Tyranitar
    Thunder Wave guarantees paralysis, Body Slam deals damage and can paralyze Ground types in exchange for failing to paralyze 40% of the time
    Last move team-dependent, Healing Wish allows Jirachi to bring a weakened teammate back from the brink of death, U-turn allows momentum and easier Wish-passing, Stealth Rock allows Jirachi to set up rocks for a team, and Protect increases Jirachi's longevity by stalling out the charge turn of Wish and getting extra Leftovers recovery.


Set Details
========

    Max HP gives Jirachi maximum mixed bulk
    32 Spe gives Jirachi enough speed to outrun Jolly Tyranitar (Banded Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar).
    Remaining EVs are put in to physical bulk to tank hits better.
    Leftovers gives passive recovery
    252 HP / 136 SpD / 120 Spe Careful can be used to outrun Jolly Mega Tyranitar and attempt to flinch him to death


Usage Tips
========

    Set is useful for slower, bulky teams due to Paralysis + Wish
    Beware of physical attacking Dark types and Scizor
    Fairly easy to come in on walls due to Toxic immunity
    Jirachi tends to do better on rain teams


Team Options
========

    Edgequake users (Terrakion, Lando-T, etc.) are Jirachi's best friend
    Mandibuzz partners well defensively, as it can tank Dark, Ghost, and Ground type hits. Also beats Aegislash.
    Fighting types (especially Keldeo) can threaten many of its checks
    Specially bulky Fairies help it beat Greninja and other Dark types.
    Water types like Gyarados or Greninja help with Ground and Fire weaknesses


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Iron Head
move 2: Fire Punch/Thunderpunch/Ice Punch
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Trick/Healing Wish
ability: Serene Grace
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

    Iron Head is the star of the set, allowing you to flinch your way through a very annoyed opponent
    Fire Punch can be used to beat Scizor, Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Genesect, though it fails to OHKO Mega Lucario. Thunderpunch lets you hit bulky waters like Gyarados, while Ice Punch lets you OHKO bulky Grounds and Dragons.
    U-turn keeps momentum and lets Jirachi bounce off of Pursuit users that switch in.
    Last move depends on what your team would prefer. Trick can cripple stall mons, while Healing Wish can bring one of your other mons back from near-death.


Set Details
========

    EVs maximize Attack and Speed. Jolly nature is needed to speed tie other base 100s.
    4 EVs put in SpD gives Gene an Attack boost rather than a SpA boost
    Choice Scarf is needed to outrun most mons, notably Scarfed Genesect

Usage Tips
========

    Best used to flinch through your opponent
    Avoid Pursuit trappers and faster Scarfed mons
    Running with a Thunder Wave user is highly recommended to increase flinch chance

Team Options
========

    Klefki pairs well with Jirachi for psychological reasons: your opponent begins the match with tears already in his eyes
    Edgequake users to cover Fire and Aegislash weakness
    Mandibuzz for Aegislash
    Fighting types with coverage (Keldeo) for Heatran, Greninja, and other Dark types.
    Water types help with Ground and Fire weaknesses
    Electric types such as Mega Manectric help beat Skarmory and bulky Water types that Jirachi does little damage to

Paraflinch
########
name: Paraflinch
move 1: Iron Head
move 2: Body Slam/Thunder Wave
move 3: Drain Punch/U-turn
move 4: Ice Punch/Fire Punch
ability: Serene Grace
item: Assault Vest/Leftovers
evs: 224 HP / 252 Atk / 32 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

    Iron Head gives STAB and an annoyingly high flinch chance
    Body Slam lets Jirachi spread Paralysis while dealing damage and being able to para Ground types, while Thunder Wave guarantees paralysis on everything else (note that T-wave shouldn't be used with AV)
    Drain Punch allows for recovery (ideally used with AV), while U-turn lets Jirachi hit and run. Both hit Greninja for super-effective damage, though both fail to OHKO
    Ice Punch and Fire Punch both allow it to beat some of its checks. Ice Punch kills bulky Grounds (namely, Gliscor), while Fire Punch can keep Scizor from Pursuit trapping you.


Set Details
========

    EVs maximize bulk and Attack
    32 Spe EVs to outrun Jolly Tyranitar
    Assault Vest lets it tank crazy hits, like Aegislash's Shadow Ball and Greninja's Dark Pulse
    Leftovers has more staying power, and allows Jirachi to recover while the enemy can't move


Usage Tips
========

    Avoid Pursuit trappers, who still ruin your day
    Main goal is to stop your opponent from moving till their pokes die or they ragequit
    While AV can survive hits from some Jirachi checks with this set, it should be noted that Jirachi usually fails to OHKO back.

Team Options
========

    Wish passer to ease recovery, ideally a bulky Fairy type to help against Greninja
    Mandibuzz (reasons mentioned in earlier sets)
    Edgequake users (reasons mentioned in earlier sets)
    Fighting types with coverage (again, mentioned in earlier sets)
    Water types (earlier sets)
    Electric types help get through some Water type walls


Other Options
########

    Air Balloon
    Choice Band/Expert Belt (subpar power in this Generation)
    Lead (outclassed)
    Rain Special attacking sets (also outclassed)
