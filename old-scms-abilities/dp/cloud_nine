[SHORT DESC]
Blocks the effects of weather. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>All effects of fog, hail, rain, sandstorm, and sunlight are temporarily disabled as long as this Pokemon is in play. The weather condition will continue to prevail until it fades or is replaced, but the battle will act as if there is no weather condition in play. However, the game will report the messages about what weather is active, and weather-related forms, such as Cherrim and Castform, will still change and take effect.</p>
