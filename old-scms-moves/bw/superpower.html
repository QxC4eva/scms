Lowers user's Attack and Defense by 1 stage.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Lowers the user's Attack by one stage 100% of the time, and lowers Defense by one stage if and only if Attack is attempted to be lowered by the effect of this move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In a sea of competition from other high-powered Fighting-type moves, wide distribution is Superpower's saving grace; a large number of non-Fighting-type Pokemon receive Superpower as a tutor move and can make good use of it. Scizor's Choice Band set simply isn't complete without Superpower, which gives it a way to smash through enemies that resist Bug and Steel, such as Heatran. With only Heat Wave and Hidden Power to break through Steel-types otherwise, Honchkrow loves using Superpower to bust through walls without a second thought. Finally, for giggles, Contrary Spinda can use Superpower to boost its Attack and Defense to a nearly passable level.</p>
