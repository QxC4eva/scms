<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Two months ago, I was picked to play in the Battle of the Week versus ReachZero. Needless to say, I felt a lot of pressure to put forth a good performance. Because of that, I set out to make a brand new team. I started off testing a handful of new sets that I thought had promise. Each set seemed to work well individually, but the team never felt whole, because the members did not work well together. With the deadline drawing near, I started to go through a frenzy of tests, trying out at least 15 different iterations the team. What resulted was one of the best teams I have ever created: Team Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! I went with this name, because just like the Power Rangers, this team rarely ever loses  (and because they're both ridiculously bad ass). This team is designed to constantly put your opponent in a defensive position by using dual screens and bulky hard hitting Pokemon, so they cannot ever set up offensively. If your opponent is using a defensive team, they will also struggle to stop the myriad of sweepers who are hard to wall, such as CM Wish Jirachi and Salamence. This team netted a nice record of 60-3, taking out many big names and only losing in matches where huge hax was involved (except for versus Zak91, who although got lucky on two occasions, just played really well overall for his win in ST6). Without any further ado, here is...</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/485.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Uxie</strong> @ Light Clay<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 36 Def / 4 SpD / 216 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Light Screen<br />
- Reflect<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- U-turn</p>

<p>So I'm convinced that Uxie is currently the best overall lead in the game right now. With incredible defenses, access to great moves, and an impressive base speed of 95, Uxie just beats everything. With this particular set that I decided to go with, I have an action plan for every lead I have ever faced. Versus faster Taunt leads (Azelf, Aerodactyl, Gliscor), I just U-Turn out to break their sashes. You might notice that Gliscor and Uxie share the same base speed, which is why I opted to not max my speed (I hate speed ties). Instead of wondering who will be faster, I like to let Uxie take the Taunt (or even Toxic from non-lead Gliscors) and U-Turn out so that my switch in will remain uninhibited. With Jolly and 216 EVs in speed, Uxie also outpaces Roserade leads, allowing me to break their sashes with U-Turn, and go to Mence to take the Sleep Powder with Lum Berry. Now Roserade cannot set up her Toxic Spikes and is forced to die or switch out. Versus slower powerful leads like Metagross and Heatran, I can set up the appropriate screen and laugh at any attack they throw at me, while setting up my own SR. By the time Uxie leaves the scene, I am usually set up with SR and dual screens, ready to bring in whatever beast U-Turn tells me to bring. To top it all off, Uxie is usually so bulky that I can often bring it in again midgame to set screens up again before she goes down for good. At the very least, I can usually keep Uxie for a status absorber, or a death fodder Pokemon later in the match, which is always welcome for a team like this.</p>

<p>Every single member on this team becomes insanely hard to kill behind screens. Uxie also loves to draw in Dark/Ghost/Bug attacks, which gives Heatran a good opportunity to come in and wreck havoc. As I said earlier, Uxie also is the team's designated status absorber and scout. This means that anytime something comes in, and I'm not sure what set it is running, Uxie is a great switch-in. If my opponent makes a wrong move, then they will have fun watching Uxie set up some more screens. Worst case scenario, Uxie comes in, takes a big hit, and allows a free switch for another member to come in and become an instant threat.</p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Shuca Berry<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 36 HP / 252 SpA / 220 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Magma Storm<br />
- Hidden Power Grass<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Explosion</p>

<p>Heatran is usually the first Pokemon I go to once I get screens up. This beastly set usually manages to take out at least two Pokemon before going down. It is designed to trap its counters with Magma Storm, and proceed to KO them before they can take Heatran out. The extra 6.25% per turn that Magma Storm does is actually very significant in many situations. It allows Heatran to kill 4HP Latias with Dragon Pulse after SR. It allows Swampert users to not scout for HP Grass anymore by switching out. It allows you to Explode on Blissey without worrying about a switch to a Ghost. The best bonus of Magma Storm, is knowing that your opponent cannot pull a double-switch on you, so you can bring in a guaranteed counter if Heatran must switch out. The EVs are designed to allow Heatran to outspeed everything aiming at beating Jolly Tyranitar. Max special attack with Modest is required to net certain kills. You might be thinking, why not Naughty over Modest, since I'm running Explosion? Well, Explosion is pretty much only used for Blissey, who dies after Magma Storm even with a -attack nature. Because you want this Heatran to take hits and then hit back harder, you really do not want to lose out on your defensive capabilities. Shuca and screens also allows Heatran to weather any attacks and blast everything back, including things like EQs from Mix Mence.</p>

<p>The biggest selling point for using this Heatran, is it draws out and kills/weakens otherwise problematic Pokemon to other members on the this team. This beast baits and kills the likes of Swampert and Scarf Latias, who both check Salamence, Blissey, who walls Latias and Suicune, and Salamence, who can be a general pain to any team. Heatran also does a great job at drawing Pokemon out who allow me to set other members up, such as Gyarados, who is just bait for Suicune to come in and set up.</p>

<p><strong>Jirachi</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Serene Grace<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Wish<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Flash Cannon</p>

<p>Everybody should be familiar with CM Wish Jirachi by now. However, everybody seems to always jump to the Bold, defensive version when they pick it. I personally prefer this spread for almost all situations. Outspeeding the likes of Lucario and everything slower comes in handy more often than you would imagine. Jirachi also just has the natural bulk to not miss those defensive EVs very much (especially since I'm running screens on this team). Wish is always a huge asset on teams with many bulky Pokemon such as this one. Jirachi also serves another huge role on my team: stall breaking. With an immunity to Toxic, and the ability to heal off damage, Jirachi is usually only stopped by Tricks coming from other Jirachis on stall teams, which they only have one chance to pull off. I went with Flash Cannon over Psychic on this set for two reasons: Latias and Tyranitar. Electric + Steel also provides respectable neutral coverage, only being resisted by a few Pokemon in OU.</p>

<p>Jirachi is a great defensive switch in once Uxie can no longer scout for me. Excellent resistances with the ability to heal other members of my team is amazing. Also, Jirachi's typing works fantastically with Latias and Salamence, who resists Fire and Ground attacks, allowing them to come in and heal up with ease. Jirachi also works very well at finishing off the weakened special walls or tanks at the end of the game, that my team gradually weakened throughout the match.</p>

<p><strong>Suicune</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Hidden Power Electric<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Surf</p>

<p>Offensive Suicune just does not die under screens. You had better hope you're carrying Blissey, or else this thing is likely to either sweep you clean, or severely dent key players. Some people like to use Life Orb on their offensive Suicunes, but that is a huge mistake, IMO. Keeping your opponents in the dark about what kind of sets you are running is more beneficial than the extra 1.3x on your attacks. I have had so many people switch in things like Gyarados, attempting to Roar Suicune out, just to get OHKOed by HP Electric, or Brelooms switch in just to get outsped and OHKOed by Ice Beam. People really underestimate the damage output that this thing can maintain while still taking hits like a champ. Because of this natural bulk, Suicune also does an excellent job of checking offensive threats such as Gyarados and Salamence. I decided to max out speed, just to speed tie other uncommon 252 speed Suicunes. The investment is only slightly more than what I would need to beat Jolly Gyarados anyways, so the bulk I am missing out on is almost negligible. This team could have easily just been Uxie + Suicune, because matches often end with that. </p>

<p>Suicune playes so many roles on this team, it's ridiculous. When paired with Salamence's Intimidate (when screens are down), Suicune can practically check every offensive threat in the game. People also tend to scramble when they see this thing, because aside from Blissey, nothing is stopping it without losing a huge chunk of health. I usually bring Suicune out fairly early for a few reasons. First of all, if screens are still up, I can often win matches before my opponent ever gets to set anything up. Secondly, once my opponents realize that this is an offensive Suicune, they usually do not hesitate to Trick a Choice item on her, which means they often won't have one to throw onto Jirachi later in the match. Suicune also helps me scout teams really well, because people tend to switch around a few times once they figure out what kind of set I'm running.</p>

<p><strong>Latias</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Surf<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Trick</p>

<p>Choice Specs Latias is such a huge threat in today's metagame. It basically comes in on any one of its many useful resistances and says "If you don't have Tyranitar, you're at a huge risk of losing a Pokemon." I was originally running this with Skarmory on the team, because after dual entry hazards, this beast 2HKOs pretty much everything not named Blissey. However, Specs Latias hits so hard that it was still very effective even without Skarmory, so I kept it on. Not to mention, Latias's typing is just way too convenient to pass up. Latias also provides me with Trick support, which can really help versus set-up Pokemon, or Blissey. A hard-hitting sturdy Pokemon with unmatched resistances who can also lock opponents onto a single attack? What's not to love! </p>

<p>If I haven't said it enough, Latias provides this team with some much needed type resistances, namely Electric. With natural special bulk and speed, this thing can rip teams apart by just spamming Dragon Pulse at times. Although I will usually open up with Surf, spamming Dragon type attacks later on helps me scout possible Steel types to prepare for when I am ready to bring out Salamence. Latias also helps Suicune sweep sometimes, by netting a Trick on Blisseys. You might have noticed by now that I am using four special attackers as my sweepers. However, three of the four are able to take out Blissey, which is essential for helping Suicune out.</p>

<p><strong>Salamence</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Fire Blast</p>

<p>It is no secret that I think Salamence is the best Pokemon currently in OU. The raw power and speed, mixed with the factor of uncertainty makes him a wild card that is incredibly hard to predict and stop. I decided to go with this particular set for a few reasons. First of all, behind screens, this guy can almost litterally set up on any Pokemon. I do not fear any status attacks, because of the Lum Berry, and I can take even Ice attacks from bulkier Pokemon. Lum Berry also allows me to bluff Life Orb while setting up my Dragon Dances, which makes people reluctant to leave their Steel types in, for fear of a LO Fire Blast. I left Fire Blast on anyways, though, because 2HKOing things like Skarmory switch-ins is always fun. It is also really fun to Outrage something, just to have my opponent switch to Scizor on my second Outrage, thinking they can scare me away with their Bullet Punch or Confusion, just to have Lum Berry snap me out of it. Because I also don't take LO damage, Scizors cannot just come in for a free revenge kill; my opponent has to get some previous damage on me first (and hope that Reflect is no longer up). People also always seem to fall for the Lum Berry trick. They do what they can to bait out an Outrage, just to lose their Pokemon and have my Salamence back to his senses at +1 still. Max speed with a positive nature is necessary for getting at least a speed-tie with the Choice Scarf base 100's. +1 Outrage still does a ridiculous amount of damage, even without Life Orb, or being Adamant/Naughty. I have used almost every Salamence set known, and this one is by far my favorite. </p>

<p>Although Salamence is usually thought of as a pure sweeper, he serves many more purposes than just that on my team. As I mentioned before, I use Salamence in conjunction with Uxie versus Roserade leads, to guarantee that I do not have to deal with Toxic Spikes with my Suicune. I also use Intimidate to help soften blows against Suicune, so she can revenge-kill almost any offensive threat. Although I'm not running Roost on this set, I can still find ways of healing my Salamence by using his resistances and immunity to Ground attacks, paired with Wish from Jirachi. He also works very well with Latias, both wearing down Steel types for one another, until one breaks through for a clean sweep.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>When I decided to write this RMT, a lot of people asked me why I wanted to make my best team public. The answer is, just like in my Team of Torment RMT, because I wanted to try and inspire people in their team building process (and of course, show off a little at the same time ). Whereas Team of Torment was made to inspire creativity and originality when building teams, this was made to inspire synergy. Every member of this team helps each other out in many different ways. Whether it's helping to weaken each others counters, or teaming up to stop threats, or setting each other up to sweep, synergy is constantly being utilized. Because of this, I can usually overwhelm my opponents by the end of the match, opening up multiple options for victory.</p>
