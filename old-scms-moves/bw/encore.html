Causes the target to repeat its last move for 3 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This move forces the target to repeat its last successfully executed move for 3 turns. It does not prevent the target from switching out, and switching out negates the effect. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute. If Disable is used on the target after Encore, then the target is forced to Struggle until the effects of either move wear off. Similarly, if Torment is used after Encore, the target is forced to Struggle on every other turn. If the affected move runs out of PP, the effect ends. Fails if the target is already under this effect, if it has not moved yet, or if the move has 0 PP. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p> 

<p>Encore fails against the following moves:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Encore</li>
<li>Mimic</li> 
<li>Mirror Move</li> 
<li>Sketch</li> 
<li>Struggle</li>
<li>Transform</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Encore is a great move since it can cripple an opponent for 3 turns. By locking it into a useless move, one of your own team members can set up safely or finish it off. Furthermore, Encore forces switches, so it is very useful for a stall team. One notable user is Whimsicott with Prankster, as the opponent will not be able to change moves once the cotton ball switches in. Another is Wobbuffet, since its Shadow Tag ability prevents the opponent from switching, even if it knows Encore is coming. Beware of sticking this move on any Pokemon; not every Pokemon can use Encore to its greatest effect.</p>
