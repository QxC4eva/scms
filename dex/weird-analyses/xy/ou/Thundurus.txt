Overview
########
- Thundurus is still as threatening as ever, topping its Electric-type competition thanks to Nasty Plot and Prankster, and a number of attacks such as Taunt, Focus Blast, Superpower, and Knock Off.
- He is placed in a great tier, outrunning key threats such as non-Scarf Latios, Keldeo, and Landorus.
- The Hidden Power nerf is a problem, as it will lack power in cases where its checks are still active.
- Often has coverage problems, but has no other notable flaws despite this.

Thunder Wave + Three Attacks
########
name: Thunder Wave + Three Attacks
move 1: Thunder Wave
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Focus Blast / U-turn
ability: Prankster
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
nature: Timid / Naive
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Thunderbolt, Focus Blast, and Hidden Power Ice provide overall great coverage.
- Although Thundurus-I is already fast, Thunder Wave allows it to severely cripple faster threats, giving your other offensive teammates breathing room.
- U-turn can replace either Focus Blast or Hidden Power Ice for a reliable scouting move, and has the great benefit of luring + nailing Celebi.
- Substitute and Taunt offer utility, but compromises precious coverage.
- Psychic can be used for nailing Conkeldurr and Mega Venusaur.

Set Details
========
- Leftovers gives Thundurus some a substantial amount of longevity, allowing it to come in, attack, and cripple things more often.
- For a more offensive angle, Life Orb should be used to make Thundurus-I even more threatening.
- Naive nature is optimal if running U-turn; otherwise, run Timid.
- Prankster gives Thunder Wave priority. Don't consider Defiant.

Usage Tips
========
- This set is a solid crutch check for fast or boosted threats such as threats with too many Speed boosts and Scarf Jirachi.
- Use Thunder Wave scarcely and only when necessary; because of Thundurus-I's already great speed, the speed decrease is actually unnecessary to it in most situations.
- If the opposing team has a threat that you badly need paralyzed, try to be conservative when switching Thundurus-I in until it successfully does it job.
- This is not a sweeper; rather, use this Thundurus-I to attack and keep up the pressure.

Team Options
========
- Thundurus appreciates teammates that can make up for its coverage issues, which tend to crop up horribly if it uses U-turn over other moves.
- Offensive Pokemon appreciate Thundurus-I's ability to paralyze things immediately, so that they can KO the Pokemon for themselves. Mega Gardevoir and Landorus are several examples of powerful threats with middling Speed.
- Also appreciates hazard support to amplify offensive pressure. Even a simple layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock helps in the long run, and can easily be provided by Deoxys-S, Mew, and friends.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Flying
move 4: Focus Blast / Substitute
ability: Prankster
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- On a Pokemon as quick and strong as Thundurus-I, Nasty Plot is a natural move of choice to consider.
- Thunderbolt is used for consistent, reliable damage.
- Focus Blast is mandatory for coverage against a few significant defensive threats, especially Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and other Rock-types.
- Hidden Power Ice completes coverage against Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-types that commonly resist the previous two moves.
- Hidden Power Flying gives Thundurus different coverage, hitting most threats neutrally and most importantly of all, hitting Conkeldurr and Mega Venusaur where it hurts.
- Substitute is pretty cool because it prevents status (allowing Thundurus to basically walk all over Trevenant, Klefki, and Gliscor), and prevent/scout for potential revenge kills
- Psychic can also be used to hit Venusaur and Conkeldurr if you want Thundurus to keep Hidden Power.

Set Details
========
- Maximize Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature, as Thundurus-I ideally wants to hit hard and fast without relying on boosts.
- Leftovers gives Thundurus-I great flexibility and doesn't wear it down as often as Life Orb. However, Life Orb gives Thundurus-I initial power and allows it to hit hard regardless of a boost.
- Grass Knot can also be used; it provides a more reliable hit on Tyranitar, and also allows Thundurus-I to get past Ground/Water types immediately. It can be used over either HP Ice or Focus Blast.

Usage Tips
========
- This set forces out plenty of threats and has decent defensive typing, giving it plenty of opportunities to set up.
- Remember that Thundurus-I is perfectly strong enough without a boost, so determine whether or not you actually need one in specific situations. Don't be afraid to attack directly in dire situations.

Team Options
========
- This set appreciates teammates that can make up for its coverage issues, which tend to crop up horribly if it uses Taunt instead of Hidden Power Ice. Specifically, if it uses only Thunderbolt + Focus Blast, it needs help against Landorus-T, Celebi, Latias, and Goodra.
- Insurance against special walls such as Blissey and Celebi is required, though it can handle either depending on the move(s) employed.

Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Superpower
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / U-turn / Taunt
ability: Defiant / Prankster
item: Life Orb
nature: Naive
evs: 76 Atk / 180 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Aside from Superpower, Knock Off, and U-turn, most of this set's moves are self-explanatory.
- Superpower allows Thundurus-I to break through its normal counters more reliably. Targets include Blissey, Heatran, and Tyranitar.
- Knock Off is a great move to use against Latias, Latios, Chansey, and Aegislash, as well as other defensive checks in general.
- U-turn acts as a reliable scouting move, and makes a great escape tool in the face of checks and counters.
- Taunt prevents defensive Pokemon from doing whatever they want (status or healing), and is also a good answer against Baton Pass teams if using Prankster.

Set Details
========
- 72 Atk EVs allow Thundurus to OHKO Latios with Knock Off after Stealth Rock.
- While Life Orb gives Thundurus a guaranteed boost in all moves, it also wears down its HP quite a bit.
- Since this set does not employ status moves, Defiant is the better ability, as the attack boosts might actually come in handy in some situations. Taunt, however, is much better when used with Prankster.

Usage Tips
========
- This set acts as a wallbreaker for other teammates, but at the same time it is a basic attacker. Don't fret if you don't manage to get the satisfaction of luring and surprising Blissey, Celebi, and friends.
- Best used early- to mid-game, where Thundurus-I's checks and counters will likely be alive, and more vulnerable to being lured and killed by this set. Additionally, don't be afraid to attack head-on, as Thundurus-T is likely to be faster than its designated targets, and thus has the freedom of switching moves on them.
- Coverage issues can be solved by other offensive teammates.

Team Options
========
- This set wants entry hazard support in order to get guaranteed KOes against designated targets. Blissey, for example, isn't OHKOed unless at least one layer of Spikes are on the field.
- Several Pokemon in particular appreciates Blissey, Celebi, Tyranitar, and other specific Pokemon out of the field. Latias, Landorus, and Talonflame are all but just a couple of Pokemon that fit under this category.
- Insurance against special walls such as Blissey and Celebi is required, though Thundurus can handle either depending on the move(s) employed.

Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Fly
move 3: Wild Charge
move 4: Superpower
ability: Defiant
item: Power Herb / Leftovers
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
- Bulk Up boosts Thundurus's Attack and Defense, turning it more powerful.
- Fly + Power Herb gives Thundurus good coverage, and also gets surprise nails against Venusaur and Conkeldurr.
- Wild Charge is mandatory, but practical, because Thundurus has the luxury of being one of the few Electric-types that can use it well. Fries Skarmory and Water-types. However, it results in a bad amount of recoil over time.
- Superpower hits Tyranitar and Heatran, both of whom would wall Thundurus otherwise.

Set Details
========
- Use Defiant for this set because it's purely physical and it helps against Intimidate and King's Shield.
- Maximize Attack and speed with a Jolly nature.
- Power Herb surprise kills several threats so you don't have to deal with double switches, Substitute, or Protect.
- Leftovers is also good to alleviate Wild Charge recoil, and regain more recovery while in mid-air.

Usage Tips
========
- The element of surprise is important.
- Using Bulk Up is not totally necessary, but should be used against unsuspecting or weak walls. Otherwise, go nuts against bulky waters and other physically-weak pokemon with Wild Charge and Fly.
- If you're used to using Thundurus, keep in mind that this variant minds burn a WHOLE LOT more than the other sets. In other words, don't switch this set recklessly into Sableye or Scald too much.
- Don't be in a rush to lure threats.

Team Options
========
- Keep Stealth Rock off the field by using Rapid Spin or Defog; this is important considering Thundurus will rely on Wild Charge for consistent damage.
- Use this set with threats that like Venusaur and other special walls out of the game, but keep yourself equipped with other methods of handling them.

Defiant
########
name: Defiant
move 1: Wild Charge
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Superpower
move 4: U-turn / Fly / Hidden Power Ice
ability: Defiant
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Naive

Moves
========
- Wild Charge is Thundurus's most powerful physical Electric-type STAB, and puts hurt on non-resistant targets. It, however, has the unfortunate effect of recoil, so don't be reckless with it early-game.
- Knock Off is a very useful utility move that hits Aegislash, Latios, and Latias super effectively. After Defog, hits lots of Pokemon resistant to Wild Charge hard.
- Superpower brings coverage against Heatran and Tyranitar.
- U-turn allows Thundurus to escape counters (a common situation considering this set has more notable physically-oriented counters).
- Fly is used to deal huge damage to Mega Venusaur, Conkeldurr, and whatever switches in place of them.
- Hidden Power Ice is still a useful option to hit the ever-common Landorus, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor.

Set Details
========
- You want to use Defiant for this set because it's purely physical and it helps against Intimidate and King's Shield
- Maximize Attack and speed with a speed-boosting nature. Please use the Naive nature only with Hidden Power Ice.
- Leftovers is also good to alleviate Wild Charge recoil, and regain more recovery while in mid-air.

Usage Tips
========
- This set is meant to be used on Deoxys-D or Deoxys-S offensive teams to bait in Defog. It does not work on other teams otherwise.
- Gooey and Intimidate also help Thundurus gain Defiant boosts.
- Try not to use Wild Charge too recklessly, since recoil can add up very fast in conjunction with Life Orb.
- Do not treat this set as a sweeper, but rather as a glue or supporting attacker.

Team Options
========
- Keep Stealth Rock off the field by using Rapid Spin or Defog; this is important considering Thundurus will rely on Wild Charge and Life Orb for consistent damage.
- Use with Deoxys-S or Deoxys-D, and use a spinblocker in case the opponent relies on Rapid Spin rather than Defog
- When using this set, get offensive support against Venusaur as well as bulky Ground-types.

Other Options
########
- Choice Specs and Choice Scarf are considerable options; however, Thundurus greatly appreciates the ability to switch attacks, and Thunderbolt is a horrible move to get locked into.
- You may be considering using Volt Switch over U-turn. This is not advised, however, as U-turn hits a wider range of targets including Ground-types and Pokemon with Lightning Rod and Volt Absorb. On top of this, both moves are used exclusively for scouting, and failing to switch out of these targets would risk a large amount of momentum.
- Thundurus is one of the few Pokemon with access to priority Swagger, Thunder Wave, and Foul Play, which opens up the possibility of running a Parafusion set. However, Thundurus's stats aren't too suited for this strategy, and it would be a waste of his offensive talents.
- Thundurus also has access to Rain Dance, which can be used on dedicated rain teams to change the weather in case Drizzle Politoed is unable to do it at any given time.
- Dark Pulse offers neutral coverage and hits some of Thundurus's checks and counters, including Trevenant, Gourgeist, Aegislash, Celebi, Latias, and Latios, quite hard without relying on special attack boosts.

Checks & Counters
########
- **Faster Attackers**: Because of Thundurus's high attack stats and list of powerful attacks, a reliable way of getting rid of him is by revenge killing. This includes naturally fast Pokemon such as Talonflame and Greninja, threats with a Choice Scarf, or priority users. However, most risk taking heavy damage on the switch-in, or being paralyzed and thus rendered mostly useless by Prankster Thunder Wave.
- **Specially Defensive Pokemon and Tanks**: Thundurus commonly uses special attacks. Therefore, Pokemon with a naturally high Special Defense stat or an Assault Vest can tank several attacks, and respond by wearing it down. Blissey, Chansey, Conkeldurr, Goodra (with or without Assault Vest), and Mega Venusaur are great candidates for this, as they take very little damage from Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Ice, and Focus Blast. Latias and Celebi also apply as well, though they risk being hit and perhaps KO'd by a fast U-turn or Knock Off. Generally, all of the aforementioned threats also have to watch out for sets that employ Fly and other physical moves, and can even be defeated by the Nasty Plot set with proper timing.
- **Residual Damage**: Contrary to what those average defenses might say, Thunudurus actually likes being preserved throughout the match. That is to say, while status, sandstorm, hail, and Leech Seed aren't too particularly threatening for Thundurus at first, he does not enjoy being hit by these due to them shortening his lifespan quite significantly. Additionally, Stealth Rock is always annoying to switch into, and burn severely cripples sets that are reliant on physical attacks and/or Life Orb.
