[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder uses a move that is not very effective on its target, the damage is doubled.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Tinted Lens is a great ability, and it's a shame it is only limited at the moment to some quite shockingly bad Pokemon. The main users at the moment in OU are <a href="/bw/pokemon/yanmega">Yanmega</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/venomoth">Venomoth</a>, both Bug-types, but neither really able to make a lasting impression in that tier. Both of these are monstrous threats in the lower tiers, but in the OU metagame, Tinted Lens is an ability you very rarely see.</p>
