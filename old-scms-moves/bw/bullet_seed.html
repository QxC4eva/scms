[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. It has a 1/3 chance for the move to hit either 2 or 3 times, and a 1/6 chance to hit either 4 or 5 times. If a Focus Sash or the ability Sturdy is activated through one of the hits, another hit will KO the target. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate for every hit taken, and every hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock, Razor Fang, or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. Color Change will only activate on the last hit of the move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat all the hits as a single attack. If this move breaks a Substitute, the attack can still continue and hurt the target. If the target holds a Rindo, Jaboca, or Enigma Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. If the user has the ability Skill Link, this move will always hit five times.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>With a considerable power buff this generation, Bullet Seed finally sees some competitive use. Though it is on average weaker than Seed Bomb, Power Whip, and Leaf Blade, the abilities Technician and Skill Link change this, making it the primary choice. Cinccino and Breloom, which have Skill Link and Technician, respectively, are a major force with this move. Otherwise, this move has a niche use in hitting through Substitutes and Focus Sashes, but is not especially useful.</p>
