Overview
########

- Scraggy is a strong Dragon Dance sweeper with its fantastic bulk and STAB options.
- STAB Knock off allows Scraggy to tear defensive cores apart before attempting to Swep. 
- The commonness of FIghting-types in LC gives Scraggy a lot of competition, but STAB Knock Off and access to Dragon Dance sets Scraggy apart.

Moves
========

- Dragon Dance is the crux of the set, and is used to set up a sweep late-game, only once it's checks and counters are weakened.
- Knock Off is the main attack move, and should be used early- to mid-game to weaken your checks and counters.
- Drain Punch is the primary attack move, and can be used to regain health.
- High Jump Kick is super strong, and can KO stuff easier than Drain Punch can.
- Poison Jab can 2hko Spritzee after a little prior damage and Knock  Off. Iron Head can be used over it for the same purpose, it just depends  on whether you'd prefer Poison or Flinch.

Set Details
========

- EVs maximize speed, bulk, and power. A jolly nature is chosen to outspeed 21 speed scarfers.
- Shed Skin is chosen so you don't have to worry so much about status.

Usage Tips
========
- While Scraggy is a strong late game sweeper, it should be abused often for its powerful Knock Off
- Scraggy's inherent bulk allows it come in on neutral Stab attacks and threaten the opponent with Drain Punch
- Scraggy should Knock off the opponent's fighting-types before attempting to sweep

Team Options
========

- Fletchling can kill Fighting-types, and Scraggy kills flying-resists in turn.
- Pawniard forms a double-dark core, so the two can weaken eachother's checks and counters so one can sweep.
- Scraggy enjoys entry hazards from pokemon such as Ferroseed or Dwebble as it gurantees some important OHKOs on pokemon such as Mienfoo and Tirtouga
- Fighting-type resists such as Misdreavus and Trubbish are great partners.


Other Options
########

- Scraggy can run an effective Bulk Up set with Bulk up , Drain Punch, Knock Off, Rest, but Scraggy's lack of speed and weaknesses to commonly physical moves makes this set less appealing.
- Scraggy can run a bulky Intimidate Set effectively, but the existance of Pawniard and Defiant,  along with weakness to the pokemon who you would want to intimidate makes this set much worse
- Choice Scarf can be used in tandem with Moxie. 

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types** - Stuff like Mienfoo, Timburr, Meditite, and  Croagunk. They can take Scraggy's moves with a bulkier set, and can KO  with their STAB.

**Flying-types** - Fletchling, Murkrow, etc. They can revenge kill it  and usually outspeed (unless scraggy is boosted) while hitting it with  super-effective STAB. Fletchling doesn't care about Scraggy's speed boost since it gets priority Acrobatics

**Fairy-types** - Resists both STABs, hit 4x super effective.

**Misdreavus**: Faster than Scraggy before it boosts, Misdreavus threatens Scraggy with a 4x effective Dazzling Gleam.

**Abra**: Magic Guard+ Focus Sash guarantees Abra's survival as it can OHKO in return with Dazzling Gleam
