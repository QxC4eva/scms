<p>This week kicks off OMPL with a bang, pairing up many great players versus each other. Special highlight is Pikachuun versus Asterat, two wonderful Balanced Hackmons players. Ultimately, Pikachuun overcame Asterat for the win. Beginning this week we had the Bedroom Blisseys paired against the Childish Charizards. This was by far the closest pairing this week, with w0rd carrying through and pulling the Blisseys to victory. This begining was a bit rough for the Swamperts, along with the latis, but this was only the first match! This week was a great kick off and helped the players get a feel of what they were up against.</p>

<p>This was one of the more dissapointing weeks, with many of the matches being uncompleted; this is not to say there weren't good battles, however! Of the battles that got played, many new strategies were being showcased and developed. Ultimately, every team on the left side lost, this includes the Lively Latis, the Stupendous Swamperts, and the Squirmy Earthwyrms. In contrast, every team on the right side won, including the childish Charizards, the Mewtwo Maniacs, and the Bedroom Blisseys! So far, the Mewtwo Maniacs and the Bedroom Blisseys were both undefeated.</p>

<p>Week Three pairs up the two undefeated teams, the Mewtwo Maniacs and the Bedroom Blisseys, together for wonderful matches! With more battles completed this week, we had much more fun and had higher scores in general. This was the half way mark of OMPL, with Bedroom Blisseys remaining undefeated. However, the Stupendous Swamperts have yet to win a week a this point. This is not to say they are out yet though!</p>

<p>This week, the Stupendous Swamperts finally score a victory, could they be making a comeback? The Bedroom Blisseys are still undefeated at this point, while the Mewtwo Maniacs are turning for the west. In contrast, the Childish Charizards are also making a comebcack! Very exciting week with good battles and nearly all player finishing their battles. Special shoutout to LLW Gao Changgong vs Kl4ng, two amazing Balanced Hackmons players that were paired together; ultimately, Kl4ng took the victory. </p>
