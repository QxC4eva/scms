<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Provided the move hits, the user must recharge the following turn, and may not attack or switch.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>All the recipients of Frenzy Plant have more reliable options, including Giga Drain and Energy Ball, on hand; some can even use attacks such as Wood Hammer and Leaf Storm, which pack near equal power without the horrid one-turn recharge period. Frenzy Plant has nearly no competitive use; save it for slaying Team Plasma with your Serperior in-game.</p>
