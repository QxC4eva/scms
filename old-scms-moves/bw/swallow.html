<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals the user. Fails if the user has not used the move Stockpile before this move. After Swallow is used, the Stockpile counter is reset, and the user loses all Defense and Special Defense boosts gained through using Stockpile. The percentage of max HP restored depends on the number of Stockpiles used before this move, as follows:</p>

<table class="sortable">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Number of Stockpiles</th>
<th>Percentage of max HP restored</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr><td>1</td> <td>25%</td></tr>
<tr class="a"><td>2</td> <td>50%</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td ><td>100%</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Just about any other source of recovery is better than Swallow; abandoning the Defense and Special Defense boosts accumulated with Stockpile isn't the best of ideas. If the Pokemon in question lacks a reliable recovery option, such as Roost or Recover, try using Rest instead; after a few Stockpile boosts, your Pokemon should be able to endure the turns spent sleeping.</p>
