<p>Greetings yet again, Smogon! I'm back after my brief... er... fact-finding trip and ready to start the endless stream of ridiculously hard trivia questions again! Hopefully Lady Salamence and Mack the Knife did a good job in my absence. Were last issue's questions hard enough? Were they too hard (I don't think so)? If you have any feedback or complaints, you can <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/private.php?do=newpm&amp;u=118474">send them directly to me</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless, Cereza really deserves our hearty congratulations, as they have managed to trump Lady Salamence's and Mack the Knife's gauntlet of eclectic offerings, even giving more answers than the trivia-masters themselves for questions 6 and 9! You can collect your prize of a blank label from any administrator of your choice; just tell them what you want written on the label, and they'll paste it on your postbit for you. Let's take a look at the questions they had to conquer, so that we can scoff at how "easy" the questions were. </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Name all the abilities which affect wild encounter rates.</strong><br />
Arena Trap, Compoundeyes, Cute Charm, Hustle, Illuminate, Intimidate, Keen Eye, Magnet Pull, No Guard, Pressure, Quick Feet, Sand Veil, Snow Cloak, Static, Stench, Sticky Hold, Suction Cups, Swarm, Synchronize, Vital Spirit, and White Smoke all affect wild encounter rates in one way or another.</li>
<li><strong>What are the towns of Johto named after?</strong><br />
"Plant-related things." Whoa, don't blame me, that's the answer Lady Salamence gave. Anything close to this answer will probably be accepted...</li>
<li><strong>Who is the only Elite 4 member to use an Eeveelution introduced in Generation 1?</strong><br />
Flint, who is unfortunately forced to use what is arguably the worst Eeveelution, Flareon.</li>
<li><strong>Who voiced Flannery in the Japanese anime?</strong><br />
Rio Natsuki voiced Asuna (i.e., Flannery's Japanese counterpart). </li>
<li><strong>What is the only Pokémon used by Pike Queen Lucy that is not based on a serpent?</strong><br />
Shuckle is based on a cross between a fungus growing on a rock and a turtle, which is quite a bit different from a serpent.</li>
<li><strong>Name all abilities that affect accuracy.</strong><br />
Coumpoundeyes, Hustle, Keen Eye, Moody, No Guard, Sand Veil, Snow Cloak, Tangled Feet, Victory Star, and Wonder Skin. I bet you guys forgot Wonder Skin, didn't you??</li>
<li><strong>What characters can you play as in the most recent Pokémon Mystery Dungeon game?</strong><br />
Unsurprisingly, the popular Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott, Pikachu, and Axew are all playable characters.</li>
<li><strong>Which anime character made a baseball reference nearly every time he/she appeared on screen?</strong><br />
Casey. What a jock.</li>
<li><strong>Name at least two Pok&eacute;mon in the TV show that have appeared at one time or another at a size larger than usual.</strong><br />
In order of appearance, Krabby, Dragonite, Tentacruel, Kangaskhan, Onix, Magikarp, Bulbasaur, Pidgeot, Rhydon, Charizard, Sunflora, Magcargo, Goldeen, Gulpin, Whiscash, Skarmory, Claydol, Mantine, and Staraptor are all possible answers.</li>
<li><strong>What was the English name of the first BW anime episode?</strong><br />
It was called "In the Shadow of Zekrom!", an evident attempt to market the game mascots. Bah humbug.</li>
</ol>

<p>Moving on, it's time to up the ante with a new set of devious trivia questions of the highest order! I decided that it would be a good idea to sort this month's questions in order of increasing difficulty...</p>

<ol>
<li>How many moves had their priorities changed between Generations IV and V?</li>
<li>In Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, there are ten different IQ groups that depend on a Pok&eacute;mon's species. Which is the only group to contain a Pok&eacute;mon of every type?</li>
<li>If I were to add up the priorities of every single move to exist, what would the sum be?</li>
<li>I'm fighting in a Double Battle, and Trick Room is active. My +6 Speed Ninjask (with the maximum base Speed number) uses Baton Pass, while my Slowking (with its Custap Berry activated) uses Surf. Meanwhile, the opponent's Rhyperior uses Rock Slide, and his Dragonite uses Aqua Jet. What is the order of the moves this turn?</li>
<li>Suppose we score every Pok&eacute;mon based on their weaknesses and resistances; an immunity scores 3 points, a 4x resistance 2 points, a 2x resistance 1 point, a 2x weakness -1 points, and a 4x weakness -2 points. Which Pok&eacute;mon would score the highest, and what would its score be?</li>
<li>How many numbered routes in Unova can one traverse (i.e., get from one entrance to another) without stepping in any grass patches?</li>
<li>Name a Pok&eacute;mon which loses all the weaknesses it has in the main games in the Pok&acute;mon Mystery Dungeon series.</li>
<li>Not including moves that only boost one stat by one stage, name all the boosting moves that exist as a sub-effect of other boosting moves (for example, Calm Mind is a sub-effect of Quiver Dance because Quiver Dance includes Calm Mind's +1 boosts to Special Attack and Special Defence in addition to its further +1 Speed boost).</li>
<li>Two Pok&eacute;mon in the main games can be heard landing on the ground when released from their Pok&eacute; Balls, despite having the ability Levitate. Name one of them.</li>
<li>Name one Pok&eacute;mon with a unique EV yield.</li>
</ol>

<p>As always, send your answers in a private message titled "Issue 28 Trivia" to The Smog. Good luck, and remember: Bulbapedia is your friend!</p>
