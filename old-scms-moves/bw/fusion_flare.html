Power doubles if used after Fusion Bolt.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. If this move is used after another Pokemon has used the move Fusion Bolt in the same turn, its Base Power will double. If another Pokemon uses the move Fusion Bolt after this move has been used in the same turn, then the Base Power of that Fusion Bolt will double. If the user is frozen, using this move will thaw it out immediately.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>A relatively strong move, Fusion Flare is limited to Victini, Reshiram, and Kyurem-W. Reshiram and Victini will rarely run this move, if ever, as Victini will always want Fire Blast. To top it all off, Victini usually prefers V-create, thus pushing most of its special sets out of the competitive scene. Reshiram will always want Blue Flare, as it has much more power. While Fusion Flare could be a substitute for Flamethrower, Flamethrower's higher PP is much more desirable in a metagame infested with Pressure users. Kyurem-W, however, loves this move, as it provides a strong attack that rounds off its amazing coverage, hitting Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress, for super effective damage.</p>

<p>In doubles, however, this move has much more usefulness. Fusion Flare is almost always the preferred option over Blue Flare, as not only does it provide perfect accuracy, its ability to either power up or be powered up by Fusion Bolt is nothing to overlook. Should this happen, a 200 Base Power attack is nothing lousy, and will be a pain to face. Due to this, Fusion Flare is always the preferred STAB move on Reshiram in doubles.</p>
