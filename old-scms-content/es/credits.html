<p>The Spanish Translations Project is an idea that underwent several months of extensive planning. There were many tight ends that needed to be loosened before launching the project, and without the help of a select few individuals, the project would not be where it is today. A warm thank you goes out to all of of the people who put forth their time and effort toward releasing this project into the public realm with extraordinary success.</p>

<h2>Heads of the Project</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=29254">Bloo</a></li>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=32828">Setsuna</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These two individuals were the ones responsible for coming up with the idea of translating English DPP information into Spanish. Together, they organized all aspects of the Spanish Translations project to ensure that it ran smoothly. Both of these individuals put forth countless hours towards translating, HTMLing, and uploading the majority of the content that is currently located <a href="/es/items/">here</a>.</p>
