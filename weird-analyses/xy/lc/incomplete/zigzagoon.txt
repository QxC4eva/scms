Overview
########

    Zigzagoon has mediocre to terrible stats all around
    It also has a relatively sparse movepool
    However, these flaws are mitigated by its access to its signature Belly Drum + Extreme Speed combination, which allows it to quadruple its Attack and sweep with a reasonably powerful STAB with +2 priority

Moves
========

    Belly Drum is used to quadruple Zigzagoon's Attack, giving it an effective 52 Attack stat; this allows it to OHKO thew majority of the tier
    Extreme Speed is Zigzagoon's main STAB move; it is powerful and it has a priority of +2, which means it is almost always guaranteed to go first, and it does massive damage to anything at +6
    Thief for Misdreavus and Tirtouga, will elaborate more in analysis
    Seed Bomb's main use is to get past the bulkier Rock-types in the tier that resist Extreme Speed, but it also has the advantage of being able to OHKO Hippopotas at +6
    However, Protect can be used to scout random Fake Outs


Set Details
========

    The EV spread maximizes Zigzagoon's Attack, while also allowing it to survive a Misdreavus's Dazzling Gleam 94% of the time at 50% health, while also letting it live through a Gligar's 110 BP Acrobatics at 100%. The rest is invested in Speed, which allows it to outspeed Jolly Tirtouga
    Pickup is convenient to obtain more Berry Juices; while rare, it is still helpful in some situations
    Berry Juice is to heal back to 100% health after a BD
