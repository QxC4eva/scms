<p>Welcome to Issue 2 of The Player! I'm not quite sure what I was expecting from Issue 1, to be honest - the popularity of PS obviously gave me hope, but having 7,500 views on our release thread (funnily enough, that's the exact amount) is hugely satisfying. It's an apt recognition of the fantastic quality of the articles and art we received, and it's our stellar contributors who make the project something worth being a part of. I'd like to give a particular shoutout to <a href="/forums/members/173056/">Andrew</a> for the extremely cute cover art. Our customary interview this time is user <a href="/forums/members/190823/">Darnell</a>; poll winner, sim mod and dedicated Togepi fan (no, I don't know why either). Briyella lost out by a fraction - she's already massing her army of followers to try and get over the line next time, I'm sure.<br />

<p>Along with that, we hope you enjoy articles about the Wi-Fi Economy, scavenger hunts and our music room's artist of the month Savant, among other pieces this issue. We've also added a new staff member to the team, <a href="/forums/members/192841/">Antemortem</a>! He's been helping us out a lot recently, and an extra pair of hands to help out isn't something we're going to say no to. Plus, he's a driver now too, so if you see him give him double the congratulations!<br />
