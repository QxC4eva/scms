<p>With all the busyness and commotion of late, we figured it would be nice to just take a step back and reintroduce each member of the admin team. They've been split into four different categories &ndash; Owners, Leaders, Advisors, and Maintenance &ndash; so without further ado...</p>

<h3>Owners</h3>

<p><a href="/forums/members/zarel.102803/">Zarel</a> created Pokemon Showdown back when he was still known as aeo, and has been diligently making it more awesome since. He's pretty chill and easily approachable, but clearly defined "policy" as "Things I don't care about". Zarel generally just wants to work on Pokemon Showdown, and have fun, so providing one or both of those will surely put you in his good books.</p>

<p>The grand old man of competitive Pokemon, <a href="/forums/members/chaos.1/">chaos</a> is part time owner of Smogon and part time <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C5nE4UqqLk">grizzly bear</a>. When he's not coding for Smogon, you'll be sure to see him either playing Randbats (his name would be ++++++++++++++~chaos if the ladder challenge had stacked) or hosting the newest edition of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SmogonU">Smogcast</a>. He's been doing this for over 10 years, so if anyone knows their stuff it's this guy.</p>

<h3>Leaders</h3>

<p><a href="/forums/members/hugendugen.32362/">Hugendugen</a> has been a policy mover and shaker for a long time and, as a result, is on good terms with most of the staff. His impeccable judgement and kind demeanor help to counterbalance his terrible hygiene, leaving him extremely approachable for staff and users alike. In short, when it comes to handling people, Hugendugen is one of the best.</p>

<p><a href="/forums/members/jasmine.141145/">Jasmine</a> is a veteran on Pokemon Showdown. She essentially ran policy before the Smogon merge and is now back in full force. While it is still unclear whether she is in fact Zarel's waifu or a cleverbot, her kindness and enthusiasm makes her fantastic at dealing with troubled users. She is an ideal public face between the staff and the general userbase and we're lucky to have her back.</p>

<p>One of Smogon's elderly statesmen, <a href="/forums/members/haunter.12656/">Haunter</a> has been an admin on the sim since the Pokemon Online Smogon University server. He has huge experience running policy as well as a vast vocabulary of Latin legal terms. Despite his molestatoring ways, Haunter is a very approachable guy. Ask him about Italian football or his motorbike and he'll keep you entertained for hours. His simulator experience makes him a great asset to the team and an important part of the long-term policy decision making process.</p>

<h3>Advisors</h3>

<p><a href="/forums/members/bmelts.117453/">bmelts</a> showed up on Pokemon Showdown when a man of his beardliness was required. A terrific programmer and extremely nice person, bmelts used to contribute a lot to the technical side of Pokemon Showdown. Although no longer as active as he once was, bmelts is ALWAYS WATCHING, and will show up just when you need him most.</p>

<p>When <a href="/forums/members/aldaron.12630/">Aldaron</a> talks, you shut up and listen. He's a no bullshit kind of guy and has run Smogon's simulator policy since mid-2011. He's heavily involved with OU tiering and is a Tournament Director on Smogon. He's very vocal with his opinion, and just like Haunter, is vital in helping with long-term policy decisions.</p>

<h3>Maintenance</h3>

<p>Researcher extraordinaire, <a href="/forums/members/v4victini.87165/">V4</a> is the second coming of Marty (RIP in pieces). He probably knows more about Pokemon mechanics than Game Freak and has put in huge amounts of work implementing them on PS. He may be a technical Admin, but he also has significant experience in policy discussion, having been a Leader for almost exactly a year and a Mod since god knows when.</p>

<p>If you've ever looked at the ladder usage stats and wondered "which magnificent human being is responsible for this?" then <a href="/forums/members/antar.45129/">Antar</a> is your man. He ran the Pokemon Online Smogon University server for a while before the transition to Pokemon Showdown and is now our full time stats man. He also has an active <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Antar1011">YouTube page</a>, so if you've ever got some time to kill, spend an hour or three listening to one of Smogon's finest voices.</p>

<p><a href="/forums/members/the-immortal.62285/">The Immortal</a> is probably most well-known for being the secretive programmer, constantly lurking on PS from his hideout in Dubai. TI  has been contributing as a programmer for well over 2 years! He's a powerhouse when it comes to technical improvements: updating tiers, mechanics, and movesets, as well as overhauling the Scavengers room script. He has also made the most commits to the PS GitHub repository other than Zarel himself. Just like V4, he keeps up with policy on the sim as well as handling many programming-related matters.</p>

<p>The End.</p>
