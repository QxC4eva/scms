<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder is hit by a special attack, the attacker takes 12.5% of its max HP as damage. The holder must survive the hit for this to activate. This damage is not blocked by Rock Head. Pokemon with Magic Guard do not activate this Berry. One-time use.</p>

<p>Provides a one-time 80 Base Power Dark-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rowap Berry is a one-time damaging item that deals 12.5% to the opponent's maximum HP when the holder is hit by a special attack. Although this sounds like a nice way to deal some residual damage to your opponent, you are much better off running Leftovers, while finding other ways to damage your opponent. The Rowap Berry's main flaw is that the holder must <em>survive</em> the opponent's attack for the berry to even activate, completely eliminating any sort of surprise value this item may offer.</p>
