<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Badly poisons the target. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Toxic is a great attack and has quite a number of competitive uses. For starters, Toxic stalling is a simple but deadly strategy that has made a handful of Pokemon, notably Gliscor, dreaded to no end. Nearly all defensive Pokemon with low offensive stats can make use of Toxic, possibly alongside Seismic Toss, to deal effective damage to targets and discourage foes from setting up on them. Conversely, some sweepers with a spare moveslot can pack Toxic to surprise walls and slowly wear them down, which might pave the way for an eventual sweep.</p>
