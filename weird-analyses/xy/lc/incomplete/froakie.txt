Overview
########
Fast, hits a nice 17 Speed
Protean, obviously. 1.5x STAB boost on every attacking move is great.
Its special movepool is predictable, but effective
Has quite a few physical attacking and support options to take advantage of as well
Bulk -- not so great


Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Grass
move 4: U-turn
ability: Protean
item: Life Orb
evs: 68 Atk / 28 Def / 184 SpA / 188 Spe
ivs: 0 HP / 30 SpA / 30 SpD or 0 HP / 30 SpA
nature: Naive

Moves
========
Hydro Pump is Froakie’s hardest hitting move (tied with Blizzard actually), backed by STAB and Life Orb
Ice Beam hits Grass-types hard, as well as removing Froakie’s weakness to Grass
Hidden Power Ground is very important for hitting Chinchou. Not only does it deal super-effective damage, but it also makes Froakie immune to Electric.
U-turn is important for scouting purposes, and it gets the Protean boost as well
Hidden Power Grass can be used over ground to hit other Water-types harder

Set Details
========
Special Attack and Speed are maxed out so he can hit as hard and as fast as possible
68 EVs then go into attack to boost U-turn’s power
The remaining EVs go into Defense, which helps against opposing priority (and it’s the only stat left that can be boosted)
Froakie’s base stats are pretty weird, so the EVs are clunky and some are left over
The IV spread allows for 19 HP (only 1 HP of LO recoil) and Hidden Power Grass
If using Hidden Power Ground, change the IV spread to 0 HP / 30 SpA / 30 SpD (no EVs need to be changed)

Usage Tips
========
Froakie has a hard time switching into non-resisted attacks; so bring it in after a teammate has fallen or lead off with it
Go easy on the prediction with Froakie. Protean/Life Orb boosted attacks will still do a good amount to switch-ins, and a misprediction can cost Froakie its life
If in doubt, U-turn outta there

Team Options
========
A slow VoltTurn partner can help Froakie come in safely and threaten the opponent
Defog/Rapid Spin is good since Froakie will otherwise get worn down quickly by Life Orb and entry hazards.


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Grass
move 4: U-turn
ability: Protean
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 28 HP / 72 Atk / 28 Def / 184 SpA / 188 Spe
nature: Rash / Naive

Moves
========
Hydro Pump is Froakie’s hardest hitting move and is a useful revenge-killing tool
Ice Beam is for blasting those Grass- and Flying-types
Hidden Power Ground is great for Chinchou (and Volt Switch users in general), giving you the upper hand in the match early on.
Hidden Power Grass secures the OHKO on Tirtouga, and is Froakie’s best option against most Water-types
U-turn because, U-turn

Set Details
========
With full investment in Special Attack / Speed and Rash nature, Froakie hits 16 SpA and 24 Speed
Naive nature can be used to give Froakie an extra point in speed in exchange for a point in SpA
72 EVs in Attack to give U-turn a little oomph
The remaining EVs go into HP and defense

Usage Tips
========

Scarf Froakie is a momentum grabber early match, and a revenge killer mid-late match, and should be played as such
Froakie is still very frail, so don't go haywire with the predictions. U-turn if there are doubts in your mind.

Team Options
========
yup

Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Acrobatics
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Substitute / U-turn
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Quick Attack / Thief
ability: Protean
item: Berry Juice / [No Item]
evs: 28 HP / 152 Atk / 28 Def / 104 SpA / 188 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========
Once Berry Juice has been consumed, Acrobatics becomes a fearsome 110 BP STAB move
Hydro Pump allows Froakie to hit hard on the special side of the spectrum
Substitute is a great move to set up on an opponent’s switch, and it also provides Froakie with a decently reliable way of activating Berry Juice and powering up Acrobatics
U-turn is a reliable way to get Froakie out of unfavorable situations while still doing some damage to the opponent
Hidden Power Grass is preferred in the last slot as it provides Froakie with a method of hitting Chinchou and Tirtouga while also providing Froakie with resistances to Electric, Water, and Grass.
Even though its not the strongest, Quick Attack is a solid choice for picking off that last bit of HP from a faster mon.
Thief can be used to steal an item from an opponent (preferably Berry Juice so Acrobatics isn’t permanently weakened.

Set Details
========
Speed is maxed out, and the Att/SpA EVs provide Froakie with decent mixed offenses
The rest go into HP and Defense so Froakie can tank hits a little better.

Usage Tips
========
Try and set up Subtitute on Froakie forces out, and preferably outspeeds. If they stay in, no worries, you’ll be able to trigger Berry Juice faster.

Team Options
========
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Other Options
########
Toxic can be used, which gets 100% accuracy thanks to Protean
Froakie can run a full physical set with options such as Waterfall, Return, Acrobatics, Thief, Power-Up-Punch, Rock Slide, and U-turn
Froakie gets Toxic Spikes (but not Spikes) and Taunt for additional team support

Checks & Counters
########
Since it is frail with no priority outside of Quick Attack, Froakie struggles against opposing priority users.
Special walls who can tank a hit from Froakie will do a significant amount of damage back
