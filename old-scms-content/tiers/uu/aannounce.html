<h2>Archived Announcements</h2>

<h3>New Old Senators</h3>

<p>Users <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/member.php?u=7125">JabbaTheGriffin</a> and <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/member.php?u=16144">kd24</a>, both old UU players, have been (re)made members of the UU Senate! Be sure to congratulate them when you see them! ~Ace Emerald</p>

<h3>Controversial Tier Shifts</h3>

<p>Two Pokemon suspected of being too good for UU have dropped into the tier, ready to wreck havoc. Abomasnow brings permanent Hail to the field without wasting a moveslot for Snover and, even worse, the bulkiest wall to grace the tier, Chansey, has returned. Will these predicted monsters destroy the tier, or will they be more mellow than expected? Head over to the ladder to find out! ~Ace Emerald</p>

<h3>Return of the Mafia</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3476454">UU Mafia</a> has returned! Players challenge the mafia bosses, five of the best UU players, and if they win against all five, they become the new Mafia Don. Best of luck to challengers, you'll need it! ~Ace Emerald</p>

<h3>hilarious Victories</h3>

<p>In the past few days, <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/member.php?u=56643">hilarious</a> has won both the fourth #genvuu challenge and the fourth UU Mini-Tournament! Be sure to congratulate him on his victories when you see him! ~Ace Emerald</p>

<h3>JabbaTheGriffin hands over the Tier</h3>

<p>JabbaTheGriffin, the longtime UU leader, has officially handed over leadership of the UU tier to kokoloko! As a result, kokoloko will no longer be part of the UU Senate, so RT. will succeed him as the head Senate. Many congratulations are in order for kokoloko and RT., but Jabba's UU leadership will be missed. ~Ace Emerald</p>

<h3>Congratulations to Ace Emerald</h3>

<p>After some time of working for the UU community, <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/member.php?u=43686">Ace Emerald</a> has now become the most recent badgeholder! This means, that along with all the forum privileges that come with being a badgeholder, he's also going to be able to edit this very Hub himself&mdash;and considering the amount of stuff he has already written here, expect this to be updated more often! Be sure to congratulate him when you see him! ~kokoloko</p>

<h3>Let it Snow: Part Two!</h3>

<p>UU's first suspect test has come to a close, and the very first extended Senate has voted on the tiering of Snow Warning. With ten votes for unbanning the ability (and one abstain), Snow Warning is once again legal in the UU metagame. ~kokoloko</p>

<h3>Mew Suspect Test</h3>

<p>Mew has been selected as a suspect for Round 10. Will it be allowed to roam free in the amazing metagame known as UU, or will it be banished to the depths of BL? Check out all the details in Mew's very own <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3474892">Suspect Discussion Thread</a>. ~kokoloko</p>

<h3>Let it Snow!</h3>

<p>The first suspect retest of UU is underway! Following a decision by the UU Senate, the UU community is testing the ability Snow Warning to see if Hail is still broken in UU. The  UU Suspect Ladder is located on Pokemon Showdown and a new <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3474263">megathread</a> has been created to discuss Hail's impact on the current UU metagame. A formal vote will be held by the Senate after November 24th. ~kokoloko</p>

<h3>We Have a New Moderator!</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/member.php?u=14911">RT.</a> has been added to the UU moderation team due to his tremendous playing skill and dedication to the tier. He has also been added to the UU Contributions & Corrections moderation team in order to help maintain order in that forum. Be sure to congratulate RT. on his wall! ~kokoloko</p>

<h3>October Tier Shifts</h3>

<p>Four new Pokemon are now UU, and no Pokemon rose up to OU. Two Pokemon who used to be UU are now back at home: Mew, who was considered for suspect numerous times, and Tornadus, who was considered mediocre by quite a few people. In addition to the previously UU Pokemon, two brand new Pokemon are now UU: Virizion and Meloetta. This is an interesting shake up to the UU metagame. Will Mew still be the beast it always was? Is Tornadus still mediocre without its permanent rain? Will the speculation about Meloetta and Virizion being average turn out to be true? Contribute to the discussion <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3473009">here</a> and the megathread <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?p=4417059">here</a>. ~DTC and kokoloko</p>
