Overview
########

Tentacruel is a decent choice for a Rapid Spinner. It has great special bulk and usable physical bulk with investment. It also works well as a defensive Pokemon in general, with a good set of resistances. However, its role as a hazard remover is much less important with Defog, and it struggles to beat spinblockers. The lack of permanent rain makes it much easier to wear down as well, and it has a mediocre offensive presence, unlike Starmie and Excadrill. Overall, Tentacruel is a niche Pokemon that can do well on a team that requires its support.

Rapid Spin
########
name: Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin

move 4: Toxic / Knock Off
ability: Liquid Ooze
item: Black Sludge
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 224 Def / 32 Spe

Moves
========

Rapid Spin is mandatory on Tentacruel to provide great team support. Scald is a reasonably powerful STAB move with a great burn chance to threaten physical attackers and patch up its weaker defense. Sludge Bomb is a secondary STAB move that gets good coverage with Scald. In the last slot, a few different support options can be used. Toxic wears down many Pokemon throughout the course of the match, while Knock Off can annoy almost anything. Either move can also help beat spinblockers. Sludge Wave is usable over Sludge Bomb if you don't care about the poison chance, but it's often helpful. Ice Beam can also be used for different coverage, hitting Dragon-types that can otherwise switch in with ease. Finally, Haze is a great move to stop setup sweepers like Volcarona and Clefable that Tentacruel checks.

Set Details
========

The EV spread outspeeds Jolly Tyranitar, with the rest in Defense and HP to help overall bulk. Black Sludge is nice for recovery and hurting Trick users. Liquid Ooze is the main ability to punish Leech Seed, Drain Punch, and Giga Drain, but Clear Body is also good to avoid unwanted stat drops. Rain Dish should be used if you are using Tentacruel on a rain team.

Usage Tips
========

Tentacruel has little offensive presence, so it works well on a balanced or stall team. Using Rapid Spin is the main priority with Tentacruel, and it's often worth sacrificing it to do so. Scald is generally the best move to use if you don't know what they will switch in to fish for the burn. Tentacruel is a good counter to Azumarill, Scizor, and Fairy-types and can switch in on them to spin.

Team Options
========

Bulky Fairy-types like Clefable or Sylveon can handle Dragon-types like Latios and Garchomp that beat Tentacruel with ease. They can also provide Wish support. Tentacruel and Ferrothorn still have great defensive synergy, as well as Grass-types in general like Celebi. Latias resists all of three of Tentacruel's weaknesses and Tentacruel resists Bug, Fairy, and Ice. Finally, Politoed makes a great partner for Tentacruel and Tentacruel can help more balanced rain teams.

Other Options
########

An offensive Spinner with Hydro Pump, Sludge Wave, and Ice Beam or Giga Drain isn't completely awful, but Starmie outclasses it. Toxic Spikes are a decent option, but many Pokemon are immune to them. A rain stall set with Toxic and Protect can be used, but rain does not last long enough to work well.

Checks & Counters
########

- **Psychic-types**: Latios and Latias take little from every move and KO. Gothitelle can trap Tentacruel with Shadow Tag. Starmie and every other user of Psyshock 2HKO at worst.

- **Electric-types**: Thundurus and Rotom-W take little damage from Tentacruel for the most part and can weaken it heavily.

- **Ground-types**: Although they have trouble switching in on Scald, Garchomp, Landorus, and Landorus-T can take Tentacruel out with powerful STAB moves.

- **Grass-types**: Mega-Venusaur and Ferrothorn both wall Tentacruel's attacks easily.

- **Bulky Tanks**: Goodra, Assault Vest Conkeldurr, and Aegislash all take Tentacruel's attacks with relative ease and can do good damage back.
