<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Provided the move hits, the user must recharge the following turn, and may not attack or switch.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There are many alternatives out there to Giga Impact, such as Return, Double-Edge, and Body Slam; most of them have just as good distribution—if not better—and none of them have the terrible recharge side effect either. The only Pokemon who benefits from Giga Impact is Slaking, who enjoys the immediate power and can't move the next turn anyways no thanks to Truant. Otherwise, unless you're bored and like going for humiliation KOs, don't ever consider Giga Impact.</p>
