 Overview
########

    Very good typing, and ability that confer 3 immunities, a Toxic immunity, and a number of useful resistances.
    Ghost is a pretty good STAB offensively and hits steels for big damage now, as well Poison demolishes Fairies
    Only mon that has been consistently OU 5ever besides Starmie
    Very good 110 base speed back up with a solid 130 base special attack
    Wide offensive and support movepool that make Gengar a fair bit unpredictable and hard to handle
    Very frail
    Very susceptible to all forms of priority it is not immune to, as well as pursuit.


Bond, Destiny Bond
########
name: Bond, Destiny Bond
move 1: Destiny Bond
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Sludge Bomb / Thunderbolt
ability: Levitate
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

    Destiny Bond lets Gengar take on a role of a three attack wall breaker scoring kills with pure power then taking a defensive check it can not muscle past with it. Destiny Bond provides insurance against sucker punch users as per turn order, you will move after their sucker punch, it will fail, and next turn they will be trapped in a destiny bond ensuring at least a trade of pokemon.
    Shadow Ball is STAB of choice, it has a mediocre base power, however the amount of types it hits neutrally is fantastic, as well as the resistances to it uncommon.
    Focus Blast is important Coverage for Normal and Dark types that take fear not shadow ball,
    Sludge Bomb despite poor neutral Coverage has the most power of your STAB, and thus it does the most raw damage to a neutral target, as well it has a nice chance to poison the target turning som 3HKOs into 2HKOs
    Thunderbolt deserves recognition as being capable of 2HKOing Mandibuzz who beats you otherwise, it is also valuable for doing the most damage agaisnt various targets weak to it such as a Gyarados, or Keldeo
    Hidden Power Fire is an option, it allows Gengar to defeat a Scizor attempting to Pursuit trap it, as well it defeats nearly any Genesect one on one.
    Taunt is something that can be considered in the second slot, only in tandem with Destiny Bond. It is useful for stopping a pokemon that is trying to play around Destiny Bond with status moves, as well it can let Gengar beat some very passive defensive threats like Blissey.


Set Details
========

    YOu should know this by now, Max Spe, Max spa, bad defenses, good offenses
    Life orb is the most appropriate choice on an offensive Gengar as the power provided greatly improves the number of 2HKOs and OHKOs it is capable of


Usage Tips
========

    Fighting, Normal, and Ground-type moves can be switched into of course, but the opponent must be pressured into usng them! If Terrakion is facing something that does not threaten it at all its unlikely to use Close Combat when Gengar is alive
    With Destiny Bond this set does its best work early game, as it can still perform despite counters being in tact.


Team Options
========

    Mega for knock off absorption, Lucario and Mega Venusaur are in general good at this.
    Spinner/defog; hazards, sub, life orb and no healing = kill gengar
    Gengar needs pivots to switch in a lot, slow volt switches and u-turn or switch forces improve its battlefield prescence greatly. Genesect, Forretress, Scizor, and landorus are good options
    REasonably strong priority or scarf users will have trouble checking you, switch ins to aegislash (mandibuzz), bisharp (conkeldurr), azumarill (mega venusaur), genesect (heatran), etc offers a means of not losing any ground after scoring a kill
    Aegislash really likes it when you remove ghost counters with Destiny Bond, usually the opponent only has one answer to it. Take advantage of this.


Utility Attacker
########
name: Utility Attacker
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Disable / Will-O-Wisp / Pain Split
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Pain Split / Focus Blast
ability: Levitate
item: Black Sludge / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

    Substitute allows gengar to play around its poor bulk using its typing's defensive attributes advantageously by forcing the opponent to attack, setting them up to be disabled next turn. Without subsitute disable is not functional. Substitute also allows you to ease prediction on switches, beat status moves, and play around sucker punch users. Substitute in combination with Pain Split is also fantastic, as you drop your health Pain Split bcomes more and more effective.
    Disable disallows the opposing Pokemon from using the move they last used for 3 turns. This allows Gengar to prey upon opposing pokemon that rely on just one move to do significant damage to gengar, as well as completely shutting down slower choiced attackers.
    Shadow Ball is Gengar's STAB of choice that does pretty solid damage to anything that doesnt resist it, and destroys anything weak to it.
    Focus Blast forms perfect neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball and is a very, very important tool that lets Gengar patch up a weakness to dark types that attempt to beat Gengar with sucker punch, pursuit, or just by virtue of their typing in general.
    Will-O-Wisp is a fantastic move in general, however on Gengar it can very valuable for pressuring defensive pokemon, as well as severely crippling typical checks and counters, especially pursuit and sucker punch users. Will-O-Wisp is basically always a great way to take advantage of a free turn.
    Pain split is a great move for Gengar on this set for a few reasons. FIrstly, because of Gengar's bad HP it is very efficient at recovering HP meaning that you can afford to run a Life Orb, and as such a massive power boost is greatly aprpeciated for Gengar who generally has bad damage output with out it. As well as this you can punish opposing defensive pokemon for recovering their health and defeat Chansey thanks to high PP of pain split.
    Sludge Bomb can also be considered over Focus Blast as it forms reasonably good coverage with Shadow Ball, and gives gengar a nice power boost against neutral targets, as well as acting as a potent Fairy-type killer. Although this leaves you very wide open to threats such as Tyranitar, and Bisharp, thanks to Subsitute and Disable Gengar has the ability to get away from these pokemon, so it is not suicidal to consider this. Sludge Bomb also has the benefit of a 30% poison chance blending well with a stalling substitute set allowing you to, with some luck, stall some checks into KO range.
        In general there are two sets here; A two attack Substitute set backed up by a utility move, or a mono attacker set that combines two utilities. The utilities, and choice between one attack or two must be carefully considered.
        A two attack set in general requires less team support, Focus Blast in itself patches up Gengar's own weakenss to big Dark types, without a solid answer to these pokemon Focus Blast is ideal
        Will-o-Wisp is in general better against offensive teams, though still good against defense the attack drop it incurs shuts down a lot of Gengar's offensive checks
        Pain SPlit in general is better against defense. It is more effective at damaging and recovering HP against targets with larger HP stats, as well it affords the use of a life orb which helps Gengar brute force through meaty opponents.
        Disable has its uses against both, and is a good choice to back up Pain SPlit giving free turns to recover.


Set Details
========

    As gengar has pitiful bulk, and requires good speed and power for this set to function a simple maxed speed, and special attack spread is most useful
    Black Sludge goes excellently with a set that ought to be creating a fair amount of free turns, and allows for more and more substitutes to be mad
    Life orb is listed however should only be considered if your set includes pain split, being unable to recover HP makes Gengar unable to make substitutes far too quickly.


Usage Tips
========

    Subsitute + Disable preys well upon opponents that have little to hit Gengar with outside one coverage move, scouting for sets with teammates, or excessive substitute use may be helpful
    Disable prevents slower choiced attackers from doing anything at all, again, scouting for these is valuable as it can buy Gengar free turns.
    Thanks to Pain Split's high PP Gengar is able to beat Chansey 1 on 1, do not be afraid to start a PP war, as you will win.
    Ferrothorn is easy prey, for substitute disable as it relies on just one attacking move to beat Gengar. As well, Heatran lacking Roar, Gastrodon, Mandibuzz lacking Whirlwind, and Gliscor can all be beaten, and made into free Substitute

Team Options
========

    Especially without Focus Blast a strong fighting type partner to beat up on Dark types that make life a pain for Gengar is helpful.
    Gengar switches in to immunities the best, very strong and threatening pokemon that put sufficient pressure on the opponent to elect Fighting, Normal or Ground moves despite Gengar's prescence go well with Gengar. Choice Band Terrakion, for example.
    Gengar needs pivots to switch in a lot, slow volt switches and u-turn or switch forces improve its battlefield prescence greatly. Genesect, Forretress, Scizor, and landorus are good options
    REasonably strong priority or scarf users will not have trouble checking you, switch ins to aegislash (mandibuzz), bisharp (conkeldurr), azumarill (mega venusaur), genesect (heatran), etc offers a means of not losing any ground after scoring a kill
    Due to the fact that Gengar can effectively render opponents unable to damage it with Disable often forces the opponent to switch, with this hazard stacking racks up damage very efficiently. A solid hazard setting partner, such as Deoxys-D can really punch holes in team indirectly
    As damage from hazards surmount opponents may attempt to remove thse hazards. Opponents may not spin on Gengar to remove hazards thanks to ghost typing, they may Defog. Bisharp is a solid partner to Gengar in this regard as thanks to defiant you can acquire a +2 boost if the opponent defogs and you swap in Bisharp, or it can pressure the opponent to just not defogging at all, both favourable outcomes. On top of this Bisharp is a solid answer to answer to the ever present Aegislash who can check GEngar threatening with its Shadow Sneak that can OHKO.


Scarfgar
########
name: Scarfgar
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Trick / Thunderbolt / Hidden power [Ice]
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

    Shadow Ball once again is the best STAB Gengar has to spam, and as this set is a revenge killer it also has pretty valuable super effective coverage making it very useful
    SLudge Bomb is amore powerful STAB, and even with poor neutral coverage it is your best shot at tackling a neutral threat, such as a water or electric type. On top of this it crashes through grass and fairy types nicely.
    Focus Blast forms perfect coverage alongside the dual STAB, and offers fantastic super effective coverage sacking many steel, rock and dark types.
    Trick is an interesting utility, though valuable. It can not be overstated that this set is to take on the role of revenge killer, and perhaps a late game win condition against a very, very weakened opponent. Because of this it may seem like a poor idea to trick away your scarf, but the ability to destroy Chansey, as well as essetntially removing or a lot of defensive pokemon, or greedy set up sweepers is invaluable. Further still in a late game situation tricking a scarf off you when Gengar outspeeds the entire opponent's team regardless of a scarf or not makes Gengar much better.
    Thunderbolt is a solid coverage option that lets you do the most damage to big threats like Tail Glow Manaphy, and Dragon Dance Gyarados as well doing very good damage to an otherwise defensive counter; Mandibuzz
    Hidden Power Ice is a solid option for Gengar as it scores a 4x effectiveness on a pretty nice number of big threats, most importantly Dragon Dance Dragonite.



Set Details
========

    Max SpA, max Spe, this is Gengar, an offensive Gengar come on
    Choice Scarf because it's a scarf set

Usage Tips
========

    Gengar without a boosting item and choice locked is not a sweeper, nor a wall breaker. IT should be employed on revenge kills, and perhaps punishing over zealous Ground, and FIghting types attempting to make holes with their power STAB
    Be conservative tricking off a scarf, you might need it later
    Watch out for Tyranitars and other pursuit users, be sure in the move you lock yourself into. Be sure that you're making a fair trade with the opponent if you are revenge killing something and they have a good pursuit trapper that "checkmates" you after the kill
    One of Gengar's main advantages as a revenge killer is the fact that it is flat immune to Normal, and Fighting thus it does a number on sweepers that rely on these type of priority moves to sweep, exploit this. If you see an opposing Lucario, or Dragonite keep Gengar in your pocket it will reliably take these threats out if they achieve a boost.


Team Options
========

    REasonably strong priority or scarf users will have trouble checking you, switch ins to aegislash (mandibuzz), bisharp (conkeldurr), azumarill (mega venusaur), genesect (heatran), etc offers a means of not losing any ground after scoring a revenge kill
    A way to mess with the heads of pursuit users, such as a set up sweeper that resists pursuit, including but not litmited to Lucario, and Conkeldurr can deter a choice locked pursuit from nabbing Gengar as the opponent may forfeit the match if they allow your set up sweeper to achieve a free boost.


Other Options
########

    Taunt is also a cool guy, but substitute, and disable in tandem a already pretty damn good at diffusing status moves
    Gengar has a couple of miscellaneous coverage options that can beat some specific pokemon, such as Energy ball, Psychic, and Dazzling Gleam but these moves limited application. If you just really want that Gastrodon dead feel free.
    A specs set thanks to Gengar's coverage and the lack of resistances to ust Ghost-type moves may seem appealing, however it requires a hell of a lot of support to function. Hung out to dry against pursuit and sucker punch users (outside of trick), as well as any strong prioirty or choice scarf user in general make it quite easy to check. Thanks to Gengar's poor bulk it really just can't switch in enough to make a large mark on the opponent. Despite these failings it can beat pretty much every counter with coverage, or trick and the power behind Specs makes it very hard to switch into. Overall it is inefficient compared to the other sets.


Checks & Counters
########

**Tyranitar**: Tyranitar has been one of Gengar's greatest enemies for a long time. It resists Gengar's STAB moves, receives a massive special defense stat thanks to Sand Stream, finally it traps and kills it with a strong Pursuit. Despite this Focus Blast is quite threatening to tyranitar, Life Orb Gengar OHKOs a max HP variant of Tyranitar, however the tables turn in Tyranitar's favor if it runs a max special defense spread as Focus Blast fails to KO, while crunch destroys Gengar. The assault vest set is so beefy that a focus blast from Gengar that lacks a boosting item can not even 2HKO it.
**Chansey / Blissey**: These two wall all sets, and cripple with Thunder Wave, however they can lose to cleverly played Utility Attacker sets, as well as to Destiny Bond
**Bulky Pursuit Users**: Scizor, Escavalier, and Tyranitar are all capable of trapping with Pursuit, though the right coverage moves from Gengar ass well as Will-o-Wisp can deter them
**Assault vest users**: Conkeldurr, Escavalier, Tyranitar, and more Assault Vest users really ruin gengar's day, unless they can be diffused with sub disable, or 2HKO'd which is unlikely thanks to the vest, Gengar is fighting a losing battle.
**Strong Choice scarf users**: Garchomp, Terrakion, Keldeo, Physical Genesect, and what have you are all quite good checks to a Gengar that is not behind a substitute as they all cleanly outspeed and KO.
**Strong priority moves**: scizor, azumarill, talonflame, and other pokes like these have no trouble checking Gengar due to its frailty
**Thunder Wave**: Paralysis makes Gengar basically useless, most can be dodged with Substitute, however, priority users of PAralysis such as Thundurus, and Keys will force Gengar out if it not already behind one.
