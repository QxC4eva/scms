<p>Hi everyone, this is blarajan bringing you an RMT that I've  co-written with soviet (or Ban Nattorei on the server). soviet  approached me to build a team as soon as he saw that Murkrow, Gligar,  and Misdreavus were being moved back into Little Cup. He really wanted  to get into the Little Cup metagame, and the introduction of these  monsters interested him enough to make that attempt. I had also been a  bit out of the Little Cup scene, since to be quite frank, it was boring  as hell beforehand. This was all of the motivation I needed to get back  in, so I happily worked on a team with him. What came from our  teambuilding was a variety of great EV spreads, a cool offensive pair,  and a team that's sitting pretty at number one on the ladder. Many users  can attest to the team's effectiveness. I personally think this is one  of the best teams I've ever built, and it's been really solid when  handling the rest of the meta. It's been a lot of fun to play and to try  out. However, it's also gotten a bit stale—because almost all of the  Little Cuppers have SEEN it, and because I've used it so much. But here  we go!</p>

<h2>Teambuilding Process</h2>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/207.png" alt="Gligar" /> </p>
 
<p>First, we began with Gligar. This was the Pok&eacute;mon  that soviet chose originally, due to its bulk, speed, and offensive  prowess. We decided to use a Flight Gem Acrobatics set, because the  offense that gave was too good to pass up. After Earthquake / Acrobatics  / Roost, we were unsure how to proceed. We initially used U-Turn, for  the offensive momentum. However, that was underwhelming, so we tried  Swords Dance. Finally, we decided to make it SubRoost, in order for it  to handle Sucker Punch from Murkrow better, and to be more threatening  defensively. We haven't looked back since.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/207.png" alt="Gligar" />  <img src="/download/sprites/bw/589.png" alt="Scraggy" />  </p>
 
<p>As amazing as Gligar is, it does have some issues with a lot of  Pok&eacute;mon in the metagame. After thinking about it, we decided  an amazing Gligar partner was Scraggy. It was able to beat a lot of  Gligar's checks (Bronzor, Staryu, Misdreavus, etc), and is an amazing  sweeper in its own right. They complemented each other perfectly, so we  decided here that we would make this our main offensive duo.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/207.png" alt="Gligar" />  <img src="/download/sprites/bw/589.png" alt="Scraggy" /> <img  src="/download/sprites/bw/441.png" alt="Bronzor" /> </p>
 
<p>The next Pok&eacute;mon we chose was Bronzor. We needed our  own Gligar check, because we thought it would be the dominating force  of the metagame. Bronzor hard counters Bronzor, while being an excellent  check to Murkrow, Drilbur, Hippopotas, and really, like 80% of the  metagame. It tanks pretty much everything it needs to. It also gives us  Stealth Rock, which helps a lot, especially with Murkrow and Misdreavus,  who hate passive damage. It's an excellent defensive pivot, and we felt  it helped our team the best at this point.</p>

<p>We took a look at our team and went...well, we don't really  like fast Pok&eacute;mon. +1 Scraggy, Houndour, Omanyte post-smash,  Scarf Snover...none of it. We thought about Mienfoo, but threw that idea  away because we all know Mienfoo is a shitty Pok&eacute;mon. We  decided on Croagunk. Access to Vacuum Wave gave us a solid check to  those Pok&eacute;mon, and its own special bulk let us tank  Misdreavus really well. Croagunk brought a lot to the table, and we  realized we couldn't do without it.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/207.png" alt="Gligar" />  <img src="/download/sprites/bw/589.png" alt="Scraggy" /> <img  src="/download/sprites/bw/441.png" alt="Bronzor" /> <img  src="/download/sprites/bw/458.png" alt="Croagunk" /> <img  src="/download/sprites/bw/200.png" alt="Misdreavus" /> </p>
 
<p>To be honest we're not really sure why we chose Misdreavus, but  we did. Misdreavus fell into that “too good not to use” category. It  blocked spin, was offensively powerful, was bulky, tanked random hits,  etc. We tried Nasty Plot Misdreavus, but that wasn't really that good.  We then moved to Substitute, which worked better, but Misdreavus died  too quickly using it. Finally, we tried Will-O-Wisp, and fell in  love.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/207.png" alt="Gligar" />  <img src="/download/sprites/bw/589.png" alt="Scraggy" /> <img  src="/download/sprites/bw/441.png" alt="Bronzor" /> <img  src="/download/sprites/bw/458.png" alt="Croagunk" /> <img  src="/download/sprites/bw/200.png" alt="Misdreavus" /> <img  src="/download/sprites/bw/90.png" alt="Shellder" /> </p>
 
<p>Honestly at this point we didn't really know what to do. We  pretty much covered everything with these Pok&eacute;mon so the last  slot was mainly...filler? We debated between a lot of things here, like  Scarf Snover, Houndour, and a bunch of other stuff. We noticed that our  team was pretty slow at that point (nothing outsped the 19 speed tier),  so we wanted a revenger. We also noticed a bit of a weakness to  SubKrow. We put two and two together...and the legend of Scarf Shellder  was born.</p>
 
<h2>In Depth</h2>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/458.png" alt="Croagunk" /><br />
<strong>Croagunk</strong> (M) @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Dry Skin<br />
EVs: 212 HP / 28 Atk / 36 Def / 108 SpA / 116 SpD<br />
Quiet Nature (+SpA, -Spe)<br />
- Fake Out<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Vacuum Wave<br />
- Dark Pulse</p>
 
<p>Soviet: Despite the team being based around Gligar, Croagunk is  the star of the show. This Pok&eacute;mon is just so good. When we  were teambuilding, we really needed a mon to stop all of the faster  threats of the meta, and Croagunk really delivered. The combination of  Fake Out + Vacuum Wave does a number to any Shell Smasher, Scraggy,  Houndour; you name it. One of the reasons we decided to use Croagunk is,  using this spread I created, it is a great counter to Misdreavus. It  recieves 50% max from a Shadow Ball while 2HKOing after rocks with Dark  Pulse / Sucker Punch. On top of being a great offensive asset to this  team, the typing coupled with the resistances and immunity to water make  it an incredible defensive force as well. The reason I chose these EVs  is because I needed to create a very bulky set to switch in and out of  fighting moves to check the things it needed to while still having great  offensive presence. The analysis spreads really weren't good at all,  because they were unnecessarily offensive; as well, the Life Orb set  dies so fast, because what Croagunk mainly does is use Fake Out + Vacuum  Wave. That's an extra 20% HP that will never be gotten back on a  Pok&eacute;mon this team does not function without. This knowledge  in hand, we decided to use an Eviolite set designed at taking lots of  abuse while still hitting hard. I remembered from my experience of  playing before The Big 3 were banned, that Croagunk is actually a decent  check to all kinds of Misdreavus, so I decided to use that as a  baseline. The spread ensures that Misdreavus Shadow Ball does 50% max  (which is actually a very rare damage roll), so that really covers just  about any other special attacker in the tier. Something else I was  experimenting with, was a spread of 132 HP / 36 Def / 108 SAtk / 116  SDef / 116 Spd Modest (+Satk, -Atk) utilizing Icy Wind instead of Sucker  Punch. This really transforms Croagunk from a bulky priority abuser  into a late game cleaner.</p>
 
<p>Blarajan: Using this Croagunk has been absolutely amazing, let  me tell you that. It's my go-to mon for a lot of current threats in the  metagame. The moves we chose were Fake Out / Vacuum Wave / Dark Pulse  > Drain Punch / Sucker Punch. Fake Out provides free damage that  allows us to obtain many KOes we wouldn't have. Generally, Fake Out +  Vacuum wave takes out a -1 Omanyte. Likewise, Fake Out helps us stall  out an extra turn to accumulate Toxic damage from Bronzor. I can't even  describe how many instances this has saved me. If I land a toxic on a  Murkrow, or a Scraggy (and Shed Skin decides to be reasonable), Mienfoo,  or anything, Fake Out lets me let them accumulate more damage for free.  But really, Vacuum Wave is the best part of using Croagunk. Many of the  current threats in the meta are weak to fighting, plain and simple.  Houndour, Scraggy, Snover, Omanyte, are all hit by Vacuum Wave for super  effective damage, making Croagunk a really good check to a lot of  faster Pok&eacute;mon that give me a hard time. Sucker Punch / Dark  Pulse complement this nicely. The main thing that I love about this  Croagunk is how much it beats Misdreavus. Generally, Misdreavus thinks  I'll use Sucker Punch, so it Will-o-Wisps, Substitutes, or Nasty Plots.  Using Dark Pulse allows me to get about 50% on it for free. Then, Sucker  Punch lets me finish it off as it is scared of Dark Pulse. Dark Pulse  is cool as well as it allows me to hit Slowpoke for a lot of damage.  Croagunk's Fighting resistance makes it a great check to Mienfoo and  Scraggy, while its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes have made it an  invaluable asset to stall. The given spread makes it really bulky, and  makes its Vacuum Wave really powerful. Overall, it's definitely the star  of the show.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/441.png" alt="Bronzor" /><br />
<strong>Bronzor</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 228 HP / 4 Atk / 148 Def / 4 SpA / 68 SpD/ 16 Spe<br />
Impish Nature (+Def, -SpA)<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>
 
<p>Soviet: I think Bronzor is the most replacable Pok&eacute;mon on this team, because it doesn't provide much  offensive pressure and has no reliable recovery. This lets multiple  threatening Pok&eacute;mon, such as Scraggy, have an essentially  free switchin to set up, and this can be very devastating if our checks  are dead. Despite these flaws it really is crucial to the success of  this team. It is the only purely defensive Pok&eacute;mon on this  team, and as such is the initial switch for so many mons. On top of  being a great pivot, Bronzor has a useful movepool in Toxic and Stealth  Rock. Both of these moves are really important, as they provide passive  damage that breaks opposing cores easier. Stealth Rock checks multiple  mons, such as Larvesta and LO Murkrow, as well as really helping  Shellder. Stealth Rocks turns multiple crucial 3HKOs (Misdreavus,  Staryu) into 2HKOs, and that really ties the offense of this team  together. The EVs for Bronzor aren't really that flexible to be honest,  so there will more than likely not be any variation between the EVs of  this Bronzor and that of others. Basically, we maximize HP to tank the  hits better, as well as mixing the defenses to provide an optimal  balance, putting the rest (4 EVs) into each offense to make it hit  slightly harder.</p>
 
<p>Blarajan: Bronzor is way too fucking good, seriously. It is the  Pok&eacute;mon that soviet thinks is the most expendable on our  team, but I have to disagree. I have never gone a match without using  Bronzor's amazing typing and defenses to tank something, or at least to  get SR up. Bronzor is our Gligar counter, and honestly gives zero shits  whatsoever about what it does. Checks Hippopotas, Drilbur, Misdreavus,  Croagunk, tanks hits from Scraggy all day if it has to, smashes  Shellder, beats Murkrow without Heat Wave, etc. The reason Bronzor is so  good is because we decided that Psychic sucked and gave it Toxic. Toxic  allows Bronzor to at least threaten everything it cannot hit (and there  are a lot of things it cannot hit). Toxic means it can whittle down the  aforementioned Pok&eacute;mon even if it can't really do anything  to them. Likewise, I can't even tell you how many times I have Toxiced a  Scraggy in a pinch and lucked their Shed Skin until they died...Bronzor  has been an invaluable tank and honestly this team can't function  without it. Since one of the biggest threats of my team, Mienfoo, loves  to come in on Bronzor, getting the Toxic off on it really helps whittle  it down. Same with...everything, like Cradily and Hippopotas. Plus it  hits what it needs to hard enough. It always breaks Murkrow's Substitute  with HP Ice and 2HKOes Gligar, which is all that's really for.  Earthquake hits Croagunk and helps whittle things down with Toxic  damage. But honestly, Bronzor just sits on its ass. It doesn't even need  attacks and I'd still use it.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/90.png" alt="Shellder" /><br />
<strong>Shellder</strong> (M) @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Skill Link<br />
EVs: 36 HP / 156 Atk / 36 Def / 76 SpD / 196 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SAtk)<br />
- Icicle Spear<br />
- Rock Blast<br />
- Razor Shell<br />
- Ice Shard</p>
 
<p>Soviet: blarajan is always telling me how Shellder is probably  the most replacable Pok&eacute;mon on the team, but that just isn't  the case. Since most offensive teams are fairly frail, they can be  potentially swept by fast, hard hitters. To remedy this, a scarfer is  fairly necessary on an offensive team. As you can see, this team isn't  "fast" per say, with nothing outspeeding the important 19 speed tier.  When teambuilding, we noticed a trend; we are actually very weak to fast  things that were basically un-revengable by our team, as well as a  weakness to various Pok&eacute;mon with substitute (Murkrow, Gligar,  etc.) so we added the Legend, the B0SS, Scarf Shellder. This thing  really is a monster, revenging half the tier as well as hitting  deceptively hard with it's STAB moves. The main boon of this though, is  it can revenge almost anything in the tier, as well as being somewhat  hard to switch into when it choses the correct move. Max Satk / Speed  Misdreavus is 2HKO'd after Stealth Rock with Rock Blast. The EV's were  chosen so Shellder would hit 21 Speed after the Scarf boost, enabling it  to outspeed any non-Scarfed Pok&eacute;mon in the tier. The HP/Def  EVs are to maximize Physical Defense with the amount of EVs left over,  while the SDef EVs are to allow it to take various special hits better,  such as Croagunk Vacuum Wave or Snover Blizzard / Ice Shard. When  looking at this spread you'll notice the Atk isn't max, but when you go  through and run the calcs, it actually doesn't matter; The damage is  exactly the same.</p>
 
<p>Blarajan: Honestly, I don't have much to say about the king.  He, not Bronzor, is definitely our most expendable member of the team.  We needed something to beat Sub Murkrow, and it takes out Gligar just  fine, which is cool. It outspeeds all non scarfed Pok&eacute;mon  with 21 speed, meeting the minimum requirement of a revenge killer. It  can OHKO Hippopotas and Dwebble through Oran with Icicle Spear and Rock  Blast respectively, assuming one critical hit or max damage roll of the  five (which is really useful...one of the only Pok&eacute;mon that  can stop Crustle from setting up entirely). Outside of that, I really  just hit things with Icicle Spear and let it die. It does what it has  to, and that's about it.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/589.png" alt="Scraggy" /><br />
<strong>Scraggy</strong> (M) @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Shed Skin<br />
EVs: 236 Atk / 36 SpD / 212 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SAtk)<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Ice Punch</p>
 
<p>Soviet: This thing is easily the best sweeper in the tier; the  combined bulk as well as the incredible attacking prowess really push  this thing over the edge. This mon forms the main offensive core of the  team, together with Gligar. The synergy they have together is they each  remove each others checks, with Gligar taking care of the fighting  types, while Scraggy takes care of the bulkier mons like Bronzor,  Slowpoke and Hippopotas. This thing is just so bulky, it really has  amazing set up opportunities, and due to the small amount of checks, it  sweeps incredibly easily. Something I occasionally think about is using  Zen Headbutt over Crunch due to the recent spike in Croagunk usage. The  leftover EVs were put into Sdef because most of the things Scraggy has  opportunities to set up on attack from the Special side.</p>
 
<p>Blarajan: There's so much that can be said for Scraggy, it's  ridiculous. It is without a doubt the best set-up sweeper in the tier,  unquestionably so. The sheer amount of teams that are Scraggy weak is  ridiculous. At +1, Scraggy is only really beat by Croagunk and Mienfoo.  Anything else (including the big 3) is pretty much just decimated by the  appropriate move. Ice Punch smashes Gligar and Murkrow, while Crunch  decimates Misdreavus. The greatest part about Scraggy is the sheer  amount of Pok&eacute;mon it can set up on. One of the most common  defensive pivots in the current metagame, Bronzor, is pure set-up bait.  Misdreavus, Chinchou, Staryu, and many other threats are set-up on just  as well. By running the 36 EVs in Special Defense instead of Defense,  Scraggy is able to tank hits from these behemoths incredibly easily, and  set up on them accordingly. It is one of my main Misdreavus checks, as  well, and kind of just destroys the entire tier. If my opponents have  Croagunk, then I just use Ice Punch when I bring in Scraggy early game.  If they have Mienfoo, I make a lot of double switches to Gligar, or use  Drain Punch. When these two are eliminated, Scraggy WILL sweep you...no  questions asked.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/200.png" alt="Misdreavus" /><br />
<strong>Misdreavus</strong> (M) @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 240 SpA / 240 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Will-O-Wisp<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting<br />
- Thunderbolt</p>
 
<p>Soviet: Misdreavus is just a really great Pok&eacute;mon to  help push our offense. It has an amazing typing to abuse in that, it  gets a good spammable STAB on top of an immunity to fighting really tie  Misdreavus together as a Pok&eacute;mon. We have debated what the  last slot should be, and it was really never set in stone. We started  with Nasty Plot so Misdreavus could function as a 3rd set up sweeper,  but that never really worked out so we moved to Sub, and likewise, it  didn't work either. Then Rajan tried Will-o-Wisp and it has been the  best so far. It really lets us cripple a physical attacker, as well as  avoid annoying Sucker Punches from Croagunk. Another boon from its  typing is that it functions as our teams spinblocker. Even though we  don't have spikes on this team, Stealth Rock is amazing. The extra  damage it provides helps us wear down key threats like Murkrow and  Larvesta as well as breaking sashes and Sturdy. Due to the good defenses  Misdreavus boasts when utilizing Eviolite, it is often our first  switchin to things such as Mienfoo, to scout for Hidden Power Ice, or  Chinchou, if we don't want to predict too hard about it's move. The EV  spread was chosen to increase the offensive power as well as hitting the  crucial 19 speed tier.</p>
 
<p>Blarajan: Misdreavus is a pretty cool Pok&eacute;mon. Even  with a fully offensive spread such as ours, its defenses with Eviolite  are fantastic, and allow it to tank pretty much any neutral hit. It is  also incredibly strong, able to almost always smash something with its  attacks. We opted for Thunderbolt because we considered hitting Staryu  and Shellder and such more important than having Nasty Plot or Calm Mind  or Pain Split or something like that. This comes in handy due to  Misdreavus's Ghost typing. As a Ghost-type Pok&eacute;mon,  Misdreavus has the ability to block Rapid Spin. The common Rapid  Spinners, Staryu and Tentacool, both fall prey to Misdreavus's  Thunderbolt. Also, after going between a lot of moves, such as Nasty  Plot and Substitute, we settled on Will-o-Wisp for our final move.  Will-o-Wisp allows us to burn irritating attackers that might switch in  and we can't really hurt, such as Hippopotas or Gligar. Likewise, it  lets us get around Croagunk's Sucker Punch, which is its main usage. I  also tend to burn Scraggy in a pinch instead of HP Fighting it, as HP  Fighting doesn't OHKO at all. Misdreavus's combination of incredible  bulk and ridiculous offensive prowess makes it an incredibly valuable  slot on our team. Also, it's really cool, because a LO Shadow Claw from  Drilbur only does like 60%!!</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/207.png" alt="Gligar" /><br /> 
<strong>Gligar</strong> (M) @ Flying Gem<br />
Ability: Hyper Cutter<br />
EVs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Acrobatics<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Roost<br />
- Substitute</p>
 
<p>Soviet: The boss this team was made around. Gligar is an  amazing Pok&eacute;mon that has incredible versatility. It has good  speed, great bulk combined with an excellent typing and great attacking  stats. The main thing we use Gligar for is the amazing virtue it has as a  sweeper, but it is also an amazing pivot, coming in on a plethora of  threats in LC, such as HP Ice-less Mienfoo, Chinchou using Volt Switch  or even Croagunk. This thing just has so many opportunities to come in  and set up a substitute it is not funny. Another major boon is there are  perhaps only 4 Gligar counters in the entire tier, Porygon, Slowpoke,  Bronzor and Hippopotas, all of which are efficiently taken out by  Scraggy. The reason this team works is because the duo of Scraggy and  Gligar is just amazing, the only thing in the tier that can beat both of  them is Scarf Mienfoo with HP Ice, which is handled perfectly by  Misdreavus. Despite being one of the best offensive mons in the tier, it  is also one of the best defensive as well, even without the help of  Eviolite. This really brings it together as a Pok&eacute;mon no team  can go without. The spread is basically to make it the most efficient  sweeper, maximizing Attack and Speed so it hits the crucial 19 Speed  tier.</p>
 
<p>Blarajan: Gligar is a boss, end of story. He's the  Pok&eacute;mon we wanted to base our team on, and boy he did not  disappoint. We immediately knew that we wanted to use a Flying Gem  Acrobatics set, meaning Acrobatics and Earthquake were locked in stone.  The issue, then, was finding the best final two moves. Due to Gligar's  incredible defensive stats and typing, we knew we wanted it to last, so  we threw on Roost. I didn't think Swords Dance was that great because of  Bronzor, so I decided to use Substitute and fell in love. SubRoost  Gligar is the perfect combination of offensive and defensive prowess. I  can't even explain how many times this thing has brought me back from a  bad game. Using Substitute gives me a safety net when I predict a  switch, meaning Gligar can do heavy damage to like everything that isn't  Bronzor or Hippopotas. Substitute also serves the important function of  acting as a buffer against speed ties. The 19 Speed tier defines the  metagame, and using Substitute means I don't necessarily die if I lose  the speed tie. Gligar is my main out against Mienfoo, who gives my team a  hard time. Likewise, it cleans up end game realllllly well due to its  speed. If the opposing team is weakened, and their Bronzor is dead...and  you're behind a Substitute? You're golden. In fact, the fear of  SubGligar and SubKrow is the reason we have a Shellder on our team. It's  just such a good Pok&eacute;mon, and pairs really well with  Scraggy. The pair eliminate each other's counters and sweep so well it's  ridiculous.</p>
 
<p>And that's the team! It's been a ton of fun to use, and we hope you enjoyed it!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
 
<p>Easily the most dominant playstyle and arguably the most  dominant team within the tier, blarajan and soviet's LC team defines the  revolution that took place within the meta after the unbanning of  Murkrow, Misdreavus, and Gligar. Blarajan and soviet (referred to as  "the dynamic duo" from this point on) decided on focusing on the last  Pok&eacute;mon in that set: Gligar. While Gligar is a stellar  Pok&eacute;mon defensively, it really shines offensively due to its  bulk limiting its number of true counters. Furthermore, its counters are  all setup fodder for Scraggy, who actually became only more dangerous  with the three new unbanned Pok&eacute;mon roaming the tier. Thus,  the dynamic duo gave rise to what is now one of the most prevalent team  slates in LC. With two heavily offensive Pok&eacute;mon that already  ripped through other teams, the dynamic duo only had to place four  checks to the big threats of the meta within the other slots to quickly  rule the tier.</p>
 
<h2>On the Offensive...</h2>
 
<p>The dynamic duo's team was off to a good start even with only  Gligar and Scraggy. Gligar, due to its massive damage output with Flying  Gem Acrobatics, does not even need a set-up move such as Swords Dance;  rather, the dynamic duo opted for a set focused on Substitute and Roost  to beat defensive Pok&eacute;mon that think their minute damage can  stall it out. Gligar's main problem is Bronzor, and Scraggy sets up on  Bronzor all day. If it gets a Dragon Dance, there are only a few things  that can risk coming in, such as Mienfoo and Croagunk. This brings the  pair of Pok&eacute;mon full circle, as Gligar can take any move from  Mienfoo and Croagunk bar the extremely rare Hidden Power Ice or Icy  Wind, respectively. Besides these two threats, the team uses offensive  Pok&eacute;mon to maintain momentum, but bulkier EV spreads that aim  to allow repeated switch ins to the threats they are delegated to  handle. A good example of this is Shellder, for which the dynamic duo  opted to take out a point in Attack and put it into Defense, allowing it  to live opposing Gligar's Acrobatics (even with a Flying Gem) and still  OHKO. Another example is their Croagunk set, which has become the  staple Misdreavus counter. By going mixed and emphasizing priority,  Croagunk does not become useless after a Will-O-Wisp and also does not  have to invest in Speed, all while still acting as a reliable Scraggy  check. Unfortunately, it is unable to use Drain Punch on its current  moveset due to legality issues, but as a certain teen pop sensation  might put it, "nobody's perfect."</p>
 
<h2>On the Defensive...</h2>
 
<p>Misdreavus, despite being a Pok&eacute;mon both players  claim "pushes their offense," has tons of utility outside of putting the  pressure on opponents. Besides just blocking Rapid Spin, it sponges  hits from the likes of Staryu due to its massive Special Defense stat,  something no other team member can really boast. It also has access to  Will-O-Wisp, which greatly hinders Mienfoo and paves the way for a  Scraggy sweep. Bronzor is the most defensive Pok&eacute;mon on the  team, and despite being set up fodder for opposing Scraggy, serves as a  hard stop to opposing Gligar. It serves as the hazard setter for the  team, and acts as a check to Substitute + Roost Murkrow, which is  moderately important due to the fact that Misdreavus does not enjoy  repeatedly switching into Brave Birds. It also acts as the team's best  bet against opposing Choice Scarf users that try to revenge Gligar, such  as Shellder and Snover. Croagunk was already discussed as an important  offensive Pok&eacute;mon, but since it serves as the glue of the  team, is also notable defensively as the team's best way to handle  Misdreavus and Scraggy.</p>
 
<h2>Threats</h2>
 
<p>Due to how dangerous Scraggy is, it is only natural that any  team must play carefully against it. Despite being one of the best teams  around, the dynamic duo's team is no exception. Most notably, Scraggy  can consistently beat Shellder one-on-one if it stays healthy, so the  dynamic duo has to keep Croagunk very healthy in matches against  Scraggy. This becomes problematic since Croagunk lacks Drain Punch to  keep itself healthy, but is counteracted by the fact that if the dynamic  duo sets up their own Scraggy, they can easily win most matches.  Houndour and Larvesta are both pretty big threats to the team, but both  are weak to Stealth Rock. Nevertheless, Houndour has incredible STABs  that threaten out nearly every Pok&eacute;mon on this team in some  way or another. It can even trap Misdreavus if need be, and with  Shellder out of the way, can wreak absolute havoc. If Bronzor goes down  after being trapped by Magnemite, then Snover or Shellder can cause  problems for this team, especially if Shellder gets a Shell Smash and  stays healthy. This team also relies heavily on Croagunk. It is  responsible for checking Choice Scarf Chinchou, all Rain Dance teams,  Scraggy, Misdreavus, and Staryu if the dynamic duo's Misdreavus goes  down. Any of the aforementioned Pok&eacute;mon can capitalize on  damage done to Croagunk early on, so the team requires strategic play to  keep Croagunk in a good condition.</p>
 
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
 
<p>The dynamic duo has made a team that has been an integral part  of the new metagame. This team has only relatively few (and mostly  uncommon) weaknesses, which allowed it to dominate the ladder for quite  some time. Surely we will see teams in the future that use similar  cores, just as we will see teams that are meant to counter this team.  Good work, blarajan and soviet. You've birthed a beast, one to be  remembered as the staple offensive team at the beginning of the meta for  eons to come.</p>
