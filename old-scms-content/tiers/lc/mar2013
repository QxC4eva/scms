<h3>Speed Boost as a Possible Suspect</h3>

<p>Posted by Charmander on <strong>Mar 06, 2013</strong>.</p>

<p>After some previous discussion on Speed Boost, the Little Cup Council and other Little Cup players have decided to discuss the possibility of banning the Speed Boost ability and unbanning Yanma and Carvanha. In the fourth generation, Yanma was banned due to its overwhelming Speed and sweeping capabilities. After the start of a new generation, this speedy bug was immediately banned for the same reason, and Carvanha later fell with it. However, the community is currently discussing allowing Yanma and Carvanha back into Little Cup without their threatening ability.
