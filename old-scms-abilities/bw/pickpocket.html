The wielder immediately steals an item from an attacker using a contact move.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is struck by a contact move, it steals the opponent's held item. The effect of the attack resolves before the item is stolen, so if the wielder's item is removed as a result of the attack (via <a href="/bw/moves/pluck">Pluck</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/knock_off">Knock Off</a>, <a href="/bw/items/focus_sash">Focus Sash</a>'s effect, or other similar effects) then Pickpocket will take effect. Pickpocket fails if this Pokemon already has an item, if it is behind a <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a>, or if the opponent has <a href="/bw/abilities/sheer_force">Sheer Force</a> and attacks with a contact move that has an additional effect. Pickpocket will take effect even if the attacking Pokemon is behind a Substitute or has 0 HP remaining.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Pickpocket is basically the same as <a href="/bw/moves/thief">Thief</a>, but without needing to use a moveslot, and can be effective in certain situations; <a href="/bw/pokemon/weavile">Weavile</a> can equip Focus Sash, take the hit, thus burning the Sash, and then trigger Pickpocket, robbing the foe of their item and then sneaking an <a href="/bw/moves/ice_shard">Ice Shard</a> in before they retreat.</p>
