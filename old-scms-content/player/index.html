<p>This is the very first issue of The Player! In the past few months, we've come a long way from the webzine's inception to now. This issue features 10 articles (including this piece) as well as some fantastic cover art by <a href="/forums/members/blue-frog.163333/">Blue Frog</a>, who also created the webzine's logo. This issue's design is all in blue&emdash;the primary color of PS too. <a href="/forums/members/quarkz.206020/">Quarkz</a> assisted with creating the issue layout (he added the JavaScript) and we'll be looking to improve on that in the coming issues...</p>
