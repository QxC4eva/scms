[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by a Pokemon, reduces the power of a damaging Electric-type move that would hit the holder for super effective damage by 50%. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Electric-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>A Wacan Berry can be used if the Pokemon holding it is weak to Electric-type moves, but since it is only single-use, and the only Pokemon that would really be interested in using it are bulky Water-types, most of whom would prefer Leftovers, you are unlikely to receive much mileage out of it. You also miss out on crucial power or recovery that you may get from another item.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Wild Buizel and Floatzel (5%).</p>
<p>Receive from Fennel on first visit to Dream Worldâ€”however, you only get one of the seventeen damage-reducing Berries, and this event cannot be repeated. If you do not receive a Wacan Berry in this way, you must trade for it using Share Shelves in the Dream World.</p>
