<p>Hey! So yeah, this is my first year playing competitive Pokemon on the DS. I used to just play for fun and randomly train, but in the past few months, I've been getting the hang of EV training and such.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>I finished up my team and battled around online. I was deciding on what to use: Rain Dance or Trick Room. I battled with Trick Room numerous times with my friends, Tyler422, Alaka, and Aqueos. After long battles, I decided the next day.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>I woke up at like 6:30 and started filling out all the information for the Team Info Sheet. I chose to go with Trick Room because in a sudden epiphany while I was sleeping, I realized that it was way to solid to pass up. I arrived at 11:30 to the site of the competition. I met up with some non-Smogonite friends and had some battles. After that, I registered and the tournament started.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here's the team:</p>

<h3>Round 1: Milan vs. Busch</h3>

<p>This guy was real chill. He also played a version of Trick Room, but one I've never seen. I lead with Smeargle/Dialga and him with Heatran/Dusknoir. T1, I Fake Out Heatran/Earth Power it, but he protects. Then, Dusknoir Brick Break's Smeargle, kicking in Focus Sash. I use Dark Void and Draco Meteor the Dusknoir for the OHKO. I don't remember much from there, but I won 3-0. <strong>1-0</strong></p>

<h3>Round 2: Milan vs. Christopher</h3>

<p>This guy opens with Tyranitar and Kyogre. I Fake Out the T-tar and TR. He kills Smeargle via Sandstorm and Water Spout. I send out Kyogre and Thunder Kyogre, crit hitting it. Then, I use Dialga to Draco Meteor Tyranitar. He uses Dragon Dance. From there, I sweep 3-0. <strong>2-0</strong></p>

<h3>Round 3: Milan vs. random guy (I don't remember his name, sorry)</h3>

<p>This match is very fuzzy to me. I don't remember much about it other than the fact that I double Blizzard on his Groudon and Ho-oh. <strong>3-0</strong></p>

<h3>Round 4: Milan vs. ??? (forgot his name)&mdash;FEATURED MATCH!!!</h3>

<p>This guy was really chill. He came down from Oklahoma and he had a solid team. He starts with Salamence and Ambipom and me with Smeargle/Dialga lead. Knowing that Ambipom is notorious for Fake Out, I Follow Me with Smeargle. He does use Fake Out, leaving Smeargle with 10 HP, and Protects with Salamence. I used TR with Dialga. I Dark Void, putting his Salamence to sleep while he Protects with Ambipom. He switches Ambipom to Lugia. I expected a switch, so I Endeavor his Lugia and bring it to 10 HP. Then, I use Flamethrower to KO Lugia while having Salamence still asleep. From there, Mr. Bigfoot swept with a couple of Blizzards. GG man. <strong>4-0</strong></p>

<p>After I finish my game, I get hack checked and make my way to the Finalist Lounge. After waiting 1 and a half hours, the Finals started.</p>

<h3>Top 32: Milan vs. Infer</h3>

<p>This match wasn't really a match. He leads with Umbreon/Kyogre. I Fake Out Kyogre while he switches Umbreon to Ludicolo. I Dark Void, and switch Dialga to Kyogre after using TR. It hits both and I sweep with Water Spout and Mr. Bigfoot's Blizzards. 5-0</p>

<p>I'm happy I have an invite, but I want to get Top 4. XD</p>

<h3>Top 16: Milan vs. Jonathan (Guy who won it all)</h3>

<p>He was a great guy, and a really good player. However, this wasn't even a game. It started with my Smeargle using Dark Void, which missed BOTH of his Pok√©mon (Top and Ogre). Then, he critical hit my Kyogre with his Kyogre's Water Spout, setting up Top next turn for an easy KO. EVERYTHING went wrong that game. I wish I could replay it. Oh well... at least he won it all. :) <strong>5-1</strong></p>

<p>I got 9th. Well, since this was my first year playing competitive VGC, I'd say I did pretty well. I got my Nationals invite, so I'll probably be heading over to Indianapolis. I chose my team based on asking others and "gut-feeling." Apparently it was a good choice. Congratz to Jonathan for winning it all. :)</p>
