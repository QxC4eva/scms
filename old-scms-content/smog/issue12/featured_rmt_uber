<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Space Bound was the first Ubers team I made after I began playing the tier earlier this year. I have had some success with the team seeing as it helped me get #3 on leaderboard soon after starting Ubers. While the team hasn't changed that much since then, I've gotten a lot better even though this was still one of the teams I used the most throughout my experience in the tier. I've used this in tournaments such as SPL (4-1 record) and stuff like Ubers Cup. Having used this team for awhile, and since the Arceus Metagame is so close by, I feel it's time to retire it. Both Swords Dance and Calm Mind variants of Arceus would have no problems dealing with the team so I'd have to change so much that the team wouldn't be quite the same.</p>

<p>The initial concept for this team was creating a team that helped the Paradancer Groudon set sweep. The end result wasn't quite that since I probably sweep with Darkrai more than Groudon but the end result was far better than I anticipated.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/504.png" alt="Giratina-O" /><br />
Giratina-O @ Platinum Orb<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 62 SpA  / 196 Spe<br />
Naive nature (+Spe, -SpD)<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Shadow Sneak<br />
- Earthquake / Outrage<br />
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>Even though it's not seen much these days, Giratina-O is personally one of my favorite leads. It might have some trouble vs. some leads, but it beats the leads that I need beaten. Since my whole team is grounded (bar Giratina-O of course), limiting the entry hazards that I have to deal with was the mindset I had when choosing my lead. Because of this, I dismissed most leads that prioritized setting up hazards and decided to leave a Stealth Rock user for later in the game. While LeadQuaza was on the original draft of this team, I switched to Giratina-O after trying it out. The reason is chose Giratina-O over Rayquaza as my lead was for several reasons. Giratina-O is considerably more bulky, lacks a Stealth Rock weakness and has a nice ghost typing that allows me to block rapid spin throughout the game. While spin blocking isn't essential on my team since I'm not utilizing spikes, its particularly useful against teams that pack Ho-Oh. Ho-Oh can do quite a number to this team like most uber teams so having Stealth Rock take 50% of its health is nice. I use Earthquake over Outrage most of the time because i only ever end up outraging is vs. Kyogre leads. Even then the method isn't reliable since it can easily switch out next turn so I decided to use Earthquake instead which hits Pokemon such as Tyranitar, specially defensive Jirachi and Heatran.</p>

<h3>Lead Match-ups</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Deoxys-S</dt>
<dd>Shadow Sneak twice as it gets 1 hazard down.</dd>
<dt>Deoxys-A</dt>
<dd>Same as Deoxys-S except it does occasionally hit me hard with a Shadow Ball. If it does though, it gets no hazards.</dd>
<dt>Groudon</dt>
<dd>Draco Meteor following by whatever move I deem appropriate at the time until its gone / switched out.</dd>
<dt><span class="red">Kyogre</span></dt>
<dd>My team has trouble with Thunder Wave Kyogre. I generally bring in Jirachi on the Ice Beam / Thunder Wave then Palkia the following turn.</dd>
<dt>Dialga</dt>
<dd>Switch in Jirachi then Wish or switch Heatran in.</dd>
<dt><span class="red">Darkrai</span></dt>
<dd>Something is going to sleep, which is a huge problem. I normally choose between Heatran and Giratina-O but no matter what I'm severely crippled.</dd>
<dt>Mew</dt>
<dd>Shadow Sneak 3HKOs and it can't touch me back. Draco Meteor + Shadow Sneak has a good chance at KOing too.</dd>
<dt>Giratina-O</dt>
<dd>Jirachi and Heatran have a relatively easy time switching into this unless it has Earthquake.</dd>
<dt><span class="orange">Rayquaza</span></dt>
<dd>Switch in Jirachi on the Draco Meteor, followed by Heatran on the Fire Blast. From there I Dragon Pulse as it Brick Breaks into my Chople Berry.</dd>
<dt>Shaymin-S</dt>
<dd>Easy switch into Jirachi as I U-turn the following turn.</dd>
<dt>Forretress</dt>
<dd>Hidden Power Fire handles it pretty well.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/385.png" alt="Jirachi" /><br />
Jirachi @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Serene Grace<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 40 Def / 212 SpD / 4 Spe<br />
Careful nature (+SpD, -SpA)<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Wish<br />
- Iron Head<br />
- Thunder Wave / Body Slam<br />

<p>Specially defensive Jirachi is nothing less than a boss. It's able to take hits better than other steels while also wish passing to the rest of my team as well as itself. Jirachi also functions as the main paralysis spreader on this team using Thunder Wave to paralyze opposing mons bar Groudon and Garchomp. Because those two do commonly switch in, I often find myself U-turning in the beginning of the game. I occasionally use Body Slam because while it may be the superior move overall, I can't stand its mediocre 60% paralysis rate because there are often times when I need that guaranteed paralysis. Iron head makes its way onto this set over protect because when I use it in tandem with Thunder Wave, paraflinching annoys the hell out of my opponents. Its healing abilities may not be quite as efficient but the trade off is worth it in my opinion.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/489.png" alt="Palkia" /><br />
Palkia @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Spacial Rend<br />
- Thunder<br />
- Flamethrower<br />

<p>Palkia gets the nod over Latias as my needed Kyogre Counter solely for its revenge killing abilities. Since Kyogre generally has to be taken down before I can deal any serious damage, Palkia plays a key role in taking its hits. Draco Meteor is a hit and run sorta thing while Spacial Rend is used for more consistent damage of a period of turns. Thunder is used obviously to hit Kyogre hard while Flamethrower is used to hit steels who regularly switch-in bar Heatran. Since my team is sun based, Surf wouldn't do much a lot of the time. I used to run a Hasty nature with Outrage over Spacial Rend but since by team has Latios and Latias covered very well between Jirachi, Heatran and Darkrai, I figured it wasn't really all that necessary.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/490.png" alt="Heatran" /><br />
Heatran @ Chople Berry<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 94 Atk / 252 SpA / 164 Spe<br />
Hasty nature (+Spe, -Def)<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />

<p>With the more common sets of Heatran being Taunt + Roar and RestTalk, other Heatran sets have a nice surprise value. This Heatran's main functions are setting up Stealth Rocks for my team as well as luring Kyogre. Fire Blast is given a nod over Flamethrower because this Heatran focuses more on dealing immediate damage. A sun-boosted STAB Fire Blast from Heatran is amazingly strong doing an enormous amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Explosion is used in order to KO Kyogre as well as some other pesky Pokemon like Blissy. Dragon Pulse is used to get super effective damage on dragons who resist Fire Blast. Fireburn's suggestion of Chople berry has been helpful for dealing with Rayquaza leads better as well as any other random Fighting moves. Special Attack is maximized while enough speed is run to hit a comfortable 254 Speed while the rest is put into Attack in order to boost Explosion.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/496.png" alt="Darkrai" /><br />
Darkrai @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Bad Dreams<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Dark Void<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Dark Pulse<br />
- Focus Blast<br />

<p>Darkrai is probably my favorite sweeper in the game. Getting a guaranteed cripple on the opposing team (bar a Dark Void miss), Darkrai immediately places pressure on the opposing team. From there, it can be a deadly sweeper with its unresisted Dark Pulse + Focus Blast combination. I run Leftovers over Life Orb because I found that when using Leftovers, Darkrai died too quickly and the recoil definitely hurt. Focus Blast is used over Substitute because I feel that hitting Heatran, Dialga, and Scizor is too important to drop Focus Blast.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/383.png" alt="Groudon" /><br />
Groudon @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Drought<br />
EVs: 200 HP / 112 Atk / 108 Def / 88 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />

<p>While Rock Polish Groudon is probably my favorite Groudon set, this set is just as good. Paradancer Groudon is a fun set that abuses opposing paralyzed Pokemon very well. In the beginning of the game to mid-game, the Groudon aims to paralyze as much of the opponents team as it can while ripping holes in them with its STAB Earthquake. When Groudons main switch-ins are paralyzed and weakened, it proceeds to Swords Dance in an attempt to sweeping the opposing team. The EVs are taken from analysis and are used in order to have defensive Bulk while having a respectable Speed and Attack. Stone Edge rounds off the move set in order to hit everything that is resistant/immune to Earthquake.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So yea, Space Bound is probably my retirement team for the pre-Arceus metagame. I mean, ill probably play in some of the Uber tours, but other than that, any Ubering i do will probably be more focused on the Farceus Metagame. I liked this metagame but look forward to the new metagame.</p>

<h3>Threat List</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Kyogre</dt>
<dd>While Choiced Kyogre aren't really an issue, Thunder Wave and Calm Mind variants can be annoying. Luckily, Heatran is able to lure them and Explode. Palkia is able to Thunder, but that damage is sometimes lackluster if Kyogre gets too many Calm Minds.</dd>
<dt>Heatran</dt>
<dd>Taunt + Roar Heatran is the only one I really see, although it has plenty of other great sets. If the opponent has Spikes + SR on the field, it can be annoying because 5/6 of my team is grounded. Giratina-O is able to lure them quite well though so it isnt an issue the majority of my battles. Darkrai also has Focus Blast.</dd>
<dt>Rayquaza / Salamence</dt>
<dd>The only time SD Rayquaza gets a chance to setup is Palkia locked into a non-Dragon move so its not a huge issue. But if it sets up, I'm in trouble. Groudon can take a +2 Dragon Claw but that's about it. Dragon Dance Rayquaza isn't an issue due to Palkia. Rayquaza leads are a bit annoying as well. Salamence gets just as few setup opportunities as Rayquaza but Dragon Dance Salamence has a more legit chance of sweeping since it Speed ties Palkia after a Dragon Dance.</dd>
<dt>Garchomp</dt>
<dd>Choice Scarf Garchomp outspeeds Palkia and based off what its locked into, can heavily damage my team. Choice Band and Swords Dance Garchomp are outsped by Palkia but have an easier time with Groudon.</dd>
<dt>Ho-Oh</dt>
<dd>What team doesn't have problems with this guy? Stealth Rock cripples it and Heatran can switch in to any non-Earthquake move and Explode. Groudon can outspeed and Stone Edge, while Darkrai can put it to sleep.</dd>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This issue's featured Uber RMT is Space Bound by Megan_Fox. This team was designed around a Thunder Wave and Swords Dance Groudon, and in Megan_Fox's own words, ended up "... far better than I anticipated", even though Darkrai cleans up most of the time! This team was chosen because it did well on the ladder and employed a very creative and refreshing strategy in supporting something like Thunder Wave and Swords Dance Groudon. Hopefully you like it as much as I did!</p>

<h2>Lead</h2>

<p>Megan_Fox starts the battle off with an attacking lead that is designed to beat other specific leads. Giratina-O is excellent at taking out all the Spikes-laying leads of Ubers, such as Deoxys-S, Forretress, and even the rare Cloyster. This is especially important to Megan's team because everything outside of Giratina-O is grounded, so letting Spikes get set up early really messes up the strategy. However, using Giratina-O leaves the team helpless against some more offensive leads, namely Thunder Wave Kyogre, Darkrai, and Rayquaza. Never fear, the other members on Megan's team are calibrated to prevent these powerful and versatile leads from taking advantage of the starting match-up.</p>

<h2>Core</h2>

<p>Jirachi, Heatran, and Palkia form the basic core of this team with Giratina-O, which hopefully survives the lead match-up. When Rayquaza rears its ugly head in the lead slot, a switch to Chople Berry Heatran usually takes it down. This is also why Thunder Wave Kyogre is such a problem to the team, as the primary switch-in, Palkia, is completely crippled by Thunder Wave. Palkia does an important job, though, in both checking Kyogre and generally functioning as a revenge killer. Rayquaza after a Dragon Dance can be taken down by Palkia with Spacial Rend, and Salamence can be too if Palkia wins the Speed tie. Jirachi plays a key role here by walling Dragon-type attacks and spreading paralysis around, which can then be abused by Groudon for the late-game sweep. Jirachi is also valuable for its ability to provide healing for the team with a combination of Wish and U-turn. Lastly, Heatran is an integral member of the core, by setting up the crucial Stealth Rock, checking Dragon-type attacks, and doing massive damage with sun-boosted Fire Blast to weaken opponents for the eventual Darkrai or Groudon sweep. Despite these many assets, this core is still very threatened by boosted Dragon-type physical sweepers, namely Kingdra, Rayquaza, and Salamence. Megan has to bait these threats into an Outrage and then switch in Jirachi to paralyze them; one small miscalculation and Megan could lose a Pokemon or two!</p>

<h2>Sweepers</h2>

<p>Once all of the preparations are done, Megan deploys Darkrai and Groudon, two Pokemon that can easily take advantage of a weakened team. Darkrai is a Nasty Plot variant, and once it hits the field, it can cripple a Pokemon off the bat with Dark Void and then begin its sweep. Leftovers is used so that Darkrai has some staying power and cannot be worn down by Life Orb recoil. Once set up, Darkrai can easily finish off a previously worn down team. As if that weren't enough, Jirachi's paralysis support is further reinforced by Groudon, which also packs the crippling Thunder Wave. Early on in the game, Groudon can be used to check some threats, like Bulk Up Dialga, and then paralyze his typical switch-ins. Once the opposing team is sufficiently weakened, Groudon can force a switch, pick up a Swords Dance boost, and proceed to sweep. This strategy of gradually chipping away at the opponent's team before sweeping is very effective, and Megan's team really illustrates that with its impressive leaderboard rank.</p>

<h2>Threats</h2>

<p>As Megan_Fox so clearly points out at the end of the RMT, there are quite a few glaring issues despite the success of the team. Speed-boosting Dragon-type sweepers give the team lots of trouble, as the only way for this team to really check them is to predict perfectly. If Palkia comes in as Rayquaza Dragon Dances, it can scare Rayquaza off, but if it comes in on a Draco Meteor, then Palkia's done for. Palkia isn't even guaranteed to beat Salamence, as it has to risk a Speed tie. Once these Dragon-types have boosted themselves, Megan's only chance is to lure the Dragon-types into locking themselves into Outrage and then go to a Steel-type to either paralyze it or KO it with Dragon Pulse. This strategy isn't very reliable though, and if the opponent managed to get a layer of Spikes down despite Megan's best efforts to prevent it, then not even Heatran and Jirachi will be able to take a hit.</p>

<p>In addition to the Dragon weakness, this team also has issues with non-Choice Kyogre. Calm Mind variants can survive Palkia's Thunder and take it out in return. Even worse are the Thunder Wave variants, as once Palkia has been paralyzed, the opposing team will find it very easy to set up those Dragon-type sweepers. If Megan's team has been sufficiently weakened, Swords Dance Lucario can take advantage of it, even going so far as to sweep the team completely in some cases! Megan_Fox typically plays around these major threats with care, but unfortunately can't adequately handle them all of the time.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Megan_Fox's team is an excellent example of a well-made and nicely themed team for the Uber tier. Though, like all teams, it has a few clutch weaknesses that will haunt it in many instances. Despite these faults, good playing and a solid strategy have helped Megan take this team to the near-top of the leaderboard and even do well in the tournament scene.</p>
