<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder's Attack and Speed are reduced by 50% for 5 turns after it switches in. If the user switches out, the counter resets. This ability can be removed by <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/gastro_acid">Gastro Acid</a>, <a href="/bw/abilities/mummy">Mummy</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/worry_seed">Worry Seed</a>. Slow Start will immediately activate whenever the ability is acquired, such as through Skill Swap or <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This ability makes <a href="/bw/pokemon/regigigas">Regigigas</a> the worst legendary Pokemon that exists by a long way. This is probably the only ability comparable to <a href="/bw/abilities/truant">Truant</a> in how awful it is, so it really has zero competitive value.</p>
