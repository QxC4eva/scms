Overview
########
Amazing defensive typing allows it to counter a multitude of almost entire typings, such as Steel-, Bug-, Fire-, and Grass-types.
Powerful STAB spread moves in Heat Wave and Eruption.
Formidable bulk, being able to survive even super effective attacks, such as Rotom-Ws Hydro Pump
Unfortunately, has middling Speed, so speed control is almost necessary.
4x weakness to Ground is very exploitable
Substitute
########
name: Substitute
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Heat Wave
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Protect
ability: Flash Fire
item: Leftovers
evs: 180 HP / 252 SpA / 76 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
Substitute is a great move if used correctly, Heatran's resistances + immunities = not so hard to set up
Heat Wave is for consistent STAB spread move for use after a Substitute has been set
Earth Power provides much-needed coverage against Rock- and Fire-types, especially opposing Heatran.
Protect is a great move on any Doubles Pokemon, and it is very good to use alongside Substitute, since you will be double-targeted sometimes.
Set Details
========
EVs outspeed Rotom-W and Cress, and throw the remaining into HP and special atk
Leftovers is the main item choice, as it works well in tandem with SubProtect.
could use Charcoal to 2HKO Landorus-T (or something - i'll check this later imo)
You could minimize speed and use it effectively on a Trick Room team.
Usage Tips
========
Mention that one should use Heatran ridiculous amounts of resistances / immunities to set up a Substitute.
From there, use Heat Wave and Protect accordingly, and EP for the occasional Rock or Fire
Don't ever stay in against a Ground-type with a STAB attack, as it will easily kill you. It is also often a good idea to scout for Hidden Power Ground with Protect against Pokemon such as Latios or Genesect.
This Heatran set can be used effectively as a switch-in - especially from Grass-types as it has nice defensive synergy with them.
Team Options
========
Hitmontop is by far Heatran's favorite partner (mention how Intimidate, Wide Guard, and Fake Out greatly help Heatran fulfill it's role to the max)
Icy Wind / Trick Room Cress is a great partner too (mention how Icy Wind both controls speed for Heatran and additionally hits Garchomp and Landorus-T very hard) [potentially mention Skill Swap too]
Gardevoir / Latios = great offensive core with Heatran, they lure in Steel- and Bug-types for Heatran to set up Substitutes on. Latios also help disposing of Garchomp and can set up a Tailwind for Heatran to function better.

ErupTran
########
name: ErupTran
move 1: Eruption
move 2: Heat Wave
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Protect
ability: Flash Fire
item: Charcoal
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Quiet

Moves
========
ERUPTION IS FUCKING POWERFUL
Heat Wave is there for backup STAB spread move
Earth Power is, again, for coverage vs Fire and Rock
Protect is great for scouting, racking up leftovers recovery, and messing up offensive strategies.
Set Details
========
Speed is minimized, since this set should be used with Trick Room support.
Charcoal is the best item, as it boosts the power of Eruption while maintaining choice of moves and protect.
Usage Tips
========
Mentioning the fact that Protect is very useful when outside of TR, to shield Heatran while TR is potentially set back up.
Don't go for Eruption or Heat Wave against an obvious Wide Guard user such as Hitmontop unless you have Feint support by your side.
Team Options
========
Trick Room setters are good support - Cress and Trev get their own mentions
Cresselia is a great supporter for Heatran, since it can both set up Trick Room and support its spread moves with Helping Hand: also immune to EQ.
Trevenant has great synergy with Heatran, it OHKOs Rotom-W and Gastrodon, and burns threatening Fighting- and Ground-types.
Dusclops is also great, since WoW and weakening opposition with Pain Split will both help Heatran function like a baller.
Scrafty is also a great teammate: It has Intimidate + Fake Out for general support, and can deal with problematic Latios and Latias.
Other Options
########
HP Ice / HP Grass for Dragon and Water mons
Fire Blast is another STAB option, but Heatran is usually better off using it's spread moves.
Flash Cannon for fairies
WoW for utility.
Shuca Berry
Chople Berry
Specs if you are manly enough
Scarf for outspeeding stuff
Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Ground-types just kill. Water-types can both tank STAB fire attacks and hit back hard; Gastrodon, Rotom-W, Gyarados eat it up. Dragon-types with Earthquake such as Dragonite and Salamence take minimal damage from Heatran's attacks and OHKO back.

**Utility**: Taunt prevents Substitute, Encore locks you into it, Wide Guard blocks Heat Waves.
