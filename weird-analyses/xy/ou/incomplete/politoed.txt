Overview
########

    Drizzle nerf hits Politoed hard, meaning it can no longer establish permanent Rain.
    Still, Drizzle sets up rain without taking up a turn, making it an effective weather starter.
    Only Pokemon sans Kyogre to have Drizzle, and Drizzle + Swift Swim is no longer banned.
    Water STAB gains an automatic power boost just by switching in Politoed.
    Has a unique set of support moves, including Perish Song, Refresh and Encore.
    Stats across the board are pretty average or mediocre.
    Not a great offensive movepool.
    Now competes with Rain Dance users like Bronzong and Zapdos on offensive Rain teams, who can set up Rain and provide momentum

Rain Support
########
name: Rain Support
move 1: Scald
move 2: Protect / Ice Beam
move 3: Perish Song / Encore
move 4: Toxic
ability: Drizzle
item: Damp Rock / Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

Moves
========

    Scald is optimal, taking advantage of Drizzle while spreading Burn status.
    Protect can scout opposing Pokemon and can rack up Leftovers recovery.
    Protect + Perish Song is an effective combo, hindering opposing sweepers and forcing switches.
    Ice Beam matches well with Scald, nailing Pokemon like Dragonite who try and set up on Politoed.
    Refresh prevents status from harming Politoed, most importantly removing residual damage caused by Toxic and Will-O-Wisp.
    Encore can lock opposing Pokemon into boosting or support moves.
    Toxic cripples opposing bulky Waters and plays well with Protect.
    An alternative set using Rest + Sleep Talk can be used as a form of recovery for Politoed, as well as having the ability to continually provide status support for teams.

Set Details
========

    Maximizing defensive output is important, as Politoed can cripple many Physical threats with Scald.
    Max investment in HP and Defense alongside a Bold nature gives Politoed surprisingly good Physical defensive capabilities.
    Choice of item is very important, with each having its positives and negatives.
    In Generation 6, Damp Rock extends the time Drizzle-based Rain is on the field.
    Damp Rock provides extended Rain support for Politoed's teammates, but removes its only form of recovery.
    Leftovers gives Politoed some survivability and can rack up healing with Protect, but limits the usefulness of Drizzle in the long run.

Usage Tips
========

    Main role is to establish and re-establish Rain throughout the match while crippling opponents with support.
    With the new Gen VI mechanics, keep an eye on the Rain counter, as Drizzle can only be re-established after Rain has stopped.
    Scald is an easy move to throw out, as even resists tend to not like Scald's 30% Burn chance.
    Perish Song and Encore should be used in situations where Politoed wants to force a switch or prevent a sweep from occurring.
    Keep track of Politoed's health - very crucial when you're trying to preserve Rain support throughout the match.

Team Options
========

    Swift Swim Pokemon love Drizzle support. This includes threats like Kingdra, Omastar and Ludicolo.
    Manaphy is an excellent abuser of Politoed's Drizzle, taking advantage of boosted Surfs and Rest + Hydration.
    Fire-weak Steels (Scizor, Ferrothorn, Forretress, MegaAggron, Jirachi, etc.) love Rain support, halving the damage caused by Fire attacks.
    Thundurus-T and Jolteon can absorb incoming Electric attacks and fire off 100% accurate Thunders.
    Removal of hazards is key in keeping Politoed alive throughout the match, so Spin support is greatly appreciated.


Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Focus Blast / Scald
ability: Drizzle
item: Choice Specs / Damp Rock
nature: Modest
evs: 168 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe

Moves
========

    Rain-boosted Hydro Pumps are very, very strong.
    Ice Beam provides coverage on bulky Grass- and Dragon-types.
    Psychic can 2HKO Mega Venusaur, which is outstanding, and is is used for coverage against usual Rain checks such as Toxicroak and Tentacruel.
    Focus Blast nails Ferrothorn, a usual check, as well as Abomasnow.
    Scald gives Politoed a more accurate STAB Water option while adding a 30% Burn chance against opposing checks.
    Perish Song is an option as a last resort phazing move, but otherwise Politoed really appreciates the extra coverage or reliability of a fourth attacking move.

Set Details
========

    A Modest nature and max investment in SpA ensures that Politoed hits as hard as possible.
    84 Speed lets it out-pace zero investment Base 80's, notably Mega Venusaur which can be 2HKO'd.
    The rest of the EV's are placed in HP to promote overall bulk.
    Choice Specs is very powerful, allowing Politoed to devastate most Pokemon with Hydro Pump in the rain plus cleanly KO checks with coverage moves.
    Damp Rock allows it to be more of a team player, adding three extra turns for Rain while still applying offensive pressure to teams. It doesn't lock you into one move, but does miss out on some 2HKO's on some resists.

Usage Tips
========

    Drizzle and its mono-Water typing give it plenty of switch-in opportunities, such as against Fire, Water and Steel attacks.
    Hydro Pump will always be Politoed's go-to move. The other three coverage moves are fairly situational, but important in eliminating checks like MegaVenusaur.
    Specs does set up Drizzle for the team, so it does provide some sort of team utility for Rain teams. Just keep in mind that it's only for five turns.
    Best used on offensive Rain teams, as it provides pressure at the cost of longevity.


Team Options
========

    Swift Swim users always appreciate Rain and this set's penchant of punching holes in normal Rain checks.
    Hurricane abusers like Tornadus-T and Noivern appreciate Rain support and don't need much time to set up, if at all.
    Keldeo is a great partner for Offensive Politoed, crashing through normal checks like Ferrothorn and Chansey.
    Thundurus-T can apply offensive pressure while also absorbing incoming Electric attacks.
