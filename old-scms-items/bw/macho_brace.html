<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Reduces the holder's Speed by 50%. In-game, this item doubles the EVs gained by the holder from any battle.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Macho Brace halves the Speed stat of the user, making it almost identical to Iron Ball except that it does not remove the user's Flying typing or Levitate ability. Macho Brace therefore is best used with Trick users, Trick Room sweepers, or Gyro Ball users. An example is Bronzong, which has a very powerful Gyro Ball with Macho Brace. Bronzong can also Trick away the item when needed. However, most common Gyro Ball and Trick Room users are already slow and might prefer another item.</p>
