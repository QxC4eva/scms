<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Does nothing for 2-3 turns, but damages the target for twice the damage received in those turns. The user must keep using Bide for its duration, but it can switch out at any time. It does not take type effectiveness into account and is unaffected by evasion or accuracy modifiers. It can damage Pokemon in the invulnerable turn of Dig and Fly. If the user is attacked once, all subsequent non-damaging moves used against it will count as having done the same damage as the previous attack, increasing Bide's final damage. Sleep, full paralysis, partial trapping, and freeze will pause but not disrupt Bide's duration.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Bide is not an especially useful move competitively, since you must be dealt with damage first. If opponent is able to 2HKO, this attack will fail to deal any damage. However, in some respects, this move is more reliable than Counter, since it does not require you to predict whether the opponent will use a specific type of attack, and there is nothing immune to it. If you do decide to use Bide, make sure to use it on a very bulky Pokemon with at least moderately high HP; it must also be ensured that this Pokemon is to be attacked directly with good prediction, rather than being set up on.</p>
