[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage, and the user receives recoil damage equal to 1/4 of the damage dealt, rounded half up, but not less than 1 HP.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>As Wild Charge is the most powerful physical Electric-type move that isn't a signature move, it is a great boon to Pokemon such as Arcanine and Electivire, which previously had to resort to weaker alternatives such as ThunderPunch or Thunder Fang. While some players prefer to stick with the less powerful moves to avoid recoil, Wild Charge's higher Base Power is usually worth the recoil damage.</p>
