<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and destroys the target's Berry, if it is carrying one.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Incinerate has little competitive use. Its Base Power is extremely low, most Pokemon with access to Incinerate also have access to more powerful moves such as Flamethrower, and the secondary effect is not very useful since Berries are uncommon.</p>
