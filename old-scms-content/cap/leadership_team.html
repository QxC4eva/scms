<p>This is the top CAP leadership position, and all aspects of the CAP Project ultimately fall under this person's authority.</p>
<p><i><strong>NOTE:</strong> DougJustDoug is also the owner and head programmer of the Create-A-Pokémon Battle Server, and the head programmer for the Create-A-Pokémon website. These duties are not necessarily tied to his role as head of the project, but it certainly helps to get things done!</i></p>
