<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/242.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Blissey</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 152 HP / 252 Def / 104 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Wish<br />
- Protect<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>This is the Blissey lead. Blissey is the main special wall and is used to pass wish around in order to keep the team healthy considering not all of the other pokemon on the team have reliable recovery methods. Seismic toss is a good general attack and protect is used to scout the opponent, activate wish, or rack up poison damage.</p>

<p><strong>Swampert</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Torrent<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 SpD<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Roar<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>Swampert is used for phazing, mainly, although it's not a full on defensive wall despite the EVs listed. Earthquake and Ice Beam are used to cover the air and the ground in order to maintain some coverage. Protect is used to scout, or rack up damage. His Water/Ground typing provides a much-needed backup fire resist, and the team's only rock resist.</p>

<p><strong>Forretress</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Toxic Spikes<br />
- Payback</p>

<p>Forry functions mainly as a utility for the team (See: Blastoise). While setting up spikes, toxic spikes and maintaining rapid spin, Forry is quite well equipped for this position. Payback is a general attack (See: Seismic Toss on Blissey, or Waterfall on Gyara). The EVs here aren't used to withstand fire attacks, rather to maximize effectiveness considering his defense is already high enough along with max HP.</p>

<p><strong>Spiritomb</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Curse<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Rest<br />
- Pursuit</p>

<p>Spiritomb can be considered the oddball of the team, but that's no reason to take him lightly. Curse is used for last Pokemon situations: to kill off a wall, or to prevent PP stalling. WoW is a useful status. Rest is used here to restore HP, and to also allow Curse to be used as a phazing method in that Rest takes care of the high HP cost of Curse and most switch out of Curse unless it is a last Pokemon situation (in which case gg.) Pursuit is here for pokemon such as Starmie (blocking spin and receiving a kill for it isn't uncommon), Azelf, Gengar, and the like. Note: Latias as well on a smaller scale. </p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/499.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Rotom-H</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 242 Def / 20 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>

<p>Rotom-h is similar to Swampert, but also different in many ways. It's similar in that it isn't strictly a defensive wall due to its slight ability to attack in Thunderbolt and the burn status. It's also still rather defensive with Rest/Sleep Talk, as Swampert can be with Protect and Roar. Rotom-h is used to cover the threats it covers almost perfectly such as Scizor and Metagross. The main difference between Rotom-h and Swampert is how they function defensively. One is used to phaze and scout/rack damage, the other is used more in a tanking respect. Overall the other defensive Pokemon on the team keep Rotom from seeing too much usage and in effect from fainting due to overuse.</p>

<p><strong>Gyarados</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Roar<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>

<p>Gyarados is the 6th Pokemon of the team, and is used in conjunction with Swampert to carry out the phazing duties. Just like Rotom-h and Spiritomb function similarly and keep each other balanced, so do Gyarados and Swampert. Swampert and Gyarados mix well due to Swampert being able to tank rock and electric damage, two of the more difficult attacks for Gyarados to tank himself. The EVs and nature are used to maximize defensive capability. Waterfall is a general attack. Roar is used for phazing. Rest is to take repeated stealth rock damage and to restore HP in order to stay healthy throughout the battle. Sleep talk is in the last slot to not be a sitting duck during Rest, and to possibly pressure with a neutral priority Roar.</p>
