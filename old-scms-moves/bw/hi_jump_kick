User takes 50% recoil if attack misses.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. If the attack misses, the target uses Protect, or the target is a Ghost-type, then the user takes crash damage equal to 1/2 of its max HP, rounded down. This move cannot be used while Gravity is active. Pokemon with the ability Magic Guard are unaffected by crash damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Hi Jump Kick is absurdly powerful and highly accurate. However, it is a potent double-edged sword. If you suspect that the target will use Protect, or a Ghost will switch in, you must predict accordingly or take 50% HP in recoil. Most Pokemon that use this move are those without access to Close Combat, such as Scrafty, as Close Combat is safer and more reliable, with nearly the same Base Power.</p>
