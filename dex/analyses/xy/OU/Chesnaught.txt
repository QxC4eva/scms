Overview
#########
- Can check a surprising amount of threats in the metagame such as Garchomp, Excadrill, Tyranitar, and Aegislash.
- Leech Seed and Spiky Shield softens up the opponent very well, allowing many offensive Pokemon to get KOs faster.
- Has reliable recovery and a decent offensive presence.
- Can set up Spikes and phase to support the team.
- Despite a nice offensive movepool, it's Speed and HP let it down completely.
- Huge amounts of weaknesses such as Fire- and Flying-type moves.

Defensive
#########
name: Defensive
move 1: Spiky Shield
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Hammer Arm
move 4: Synthesis / Roar
ability: Bulletproof
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
=====
- Spiky Shield is a must. It is a useful scouting tool. It also damages many threats such as Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Genesect. Alongside Leech Seed, you will have plenty of chip damage to support the team.
- Leech Seed is a great at dealing chip damage and getting out of tough situations when combined with Spiky Shield.
- Hammer Arm deals heavy damage to threats weak to it such as Excadrill, Tyranitar and Ferrothorn. It also serves as Chesnaught's only STAB move.
- Synthesis provides reliable recovery needed when Mega Venusaur is present. It also helps when Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery isn't enough to survive strong hits.
- Roar is a useful option to force out sweepers such as SD Aegislash, Garchomp and Gengar without Sludge Wave.

Set Details
========
Spamming Leech Seed even on a risky predicted switch is a very useful tactic, except for when Grass-types are present. If you think that the opposing Pokemon will stay in, use Spiky Shield. The only exception to this is if they have a setup move, in which case you should either use Leech Seed or switch out. This is especially a great way to pressure VoltTurn cores such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W.

Usage Tips
========
- Remember that Chesnaught has Bulletproof! It gives it a wide variety of switch in options such as Aegislash and Gengar without Sludge Wave.
- Chesnaught isn't meant to be used as a wall, it's a tank designed to force switches and cause chip damage.

Team Options
==========
Tyranitar can take special attacks, cover Chesnaught's Fire-, Flying-, and Psychic weaknesses, and can either provide Pursuit support or use Stealth Rock to help Chesnaught deal more damage. Don't worry about Tyranitar reducing Chesnaugt's recovery; there is rarely a time when you'll encounter a Grass-type in Sandstorm. 
Specially Defensive Heatran provides Stealth Rock and Toxic, as well as something to take special attacks.

Rotom-Wash heavily damages Flying- and Fire-types and has Will-O-Wisp to spread burn.
Scizor and Bisharp can use Pursuit to prevent Latias and Latios from using Defog.

Spikes
#########
name: Spikes
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Roar
move 3: Hammer Arm
move 4: Synthesis
ability: Bulletproof
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
=====
- Spikes lets you have some hazards which help with stall and offense alike.
- Roar lets you have another option against setup sweepers such as Aegislash or Pinsir.
- Hammer Arm is Chesnaught's most reliable STAB move.
- Synthesis is a reliable recovery move that helps a ton on any defensive Pokemon.

Set Details
========
- Can be used as a wall in emergencies, but there are better options.
- Try setting up Spikes on a predicted switch. Forcing out a Pokemon such as Rotom-W or Aegislash is a good idea.


Usage Tips
========
- Bulletproof is nice to sponge up some special attacks (namely Shadow Ball from the likes of Aegislash and Gengar).
- If you don't feel the need to set up Spikes and you know the opponent will switch, go for Roar to mess up momentum. You can do the same for Synthesis.

Team Options
=========
- Mega Tyranitar sponges most of Chesnaught's weaknesses, and also can abuse Chesnaught's Spikes and set up a Dragon Dance.
- Specially defensive Heatran takes weaknesses and sets up Rocks and spreads Toxic.
Rotom-Wash can bring in Chesnaught in safely to set up Spikes, phase Pokemon out, or just wall in general.
- Scizor / Bisharp can Pursuit Psychic- and Ghost-types. They can also discourage Latias/Latios trying to Defog the Spikes away.


Other Options
=========
- Stone Edge
- Seed Bomb
- Assault Vest

Checks and Counters
==============

- Crobat is the best counter. It can deal heavy damage to Chesnaught with Brave Bird clear Stealth Rock with Defog, Taunt to shut Chesnaught down and make it lose momentum, and U-turn to get even more momentum with a free switch in.
- Talonflame can KO Chesnaught with a priority Brave Bird, U-turn out, and stall with a priority Roost.
- Skarmory can set up hazards and deal heavy damage with Brave Bird.
- Trevenant and Gourgeist are immune to Fighting-type moves and can easily take the rest of Chesnaught's moves.
- King's Shield + Swords Dance Aegislash can set up on Chesnaught. However, Chesnaught can check any Aegislash without Hidden Power Ice.
- Specially attacking Fire-types such as MegaZard Y force Chesnaught out with a STAB Fire Blast.
