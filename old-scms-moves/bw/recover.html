<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals the user by 1/2 of its maximum HP, rounded half up.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Recover is one of the best moves in the game, and it, or one of its equivalents (Roost, Heal Order, Milk Drink, or Slack Off), is almost mandatory for any defensive Pokemon. The move is somewhat native to Psychic-types but has been spread over a broad range of types throughout the generations. Almost every wall worth its salt will need this move or one of its equivalents, as HP recovery is a crucial gameplay element. Defensive Pokemon, such as Gastrodon, Jellicent, and Latias, partially owe their success and use to this move; seemingly excellent or useful Pokemon, such as Claydol or Bronzong, find themselves down the lower end of the tiering spectrum simply because they lack a recovery move.</p>
