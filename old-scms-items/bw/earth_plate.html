[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that increases the Base Power of all Ground-type moves by 20%. When held by a Pokemon with the Multitype ability, the holder's type will change to Ground.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>An Arceus attached with the Earth Plate sees use on rain teams who are in need of a bulky Ground-type, as Groudon brings crippling sun with Drought and Garchomp has a nasty weakness to Dragon-type moves. Ground Arceus is extremely versatile, bringing a useful immunity to Electric-type attacks as well as becoming one of the few counters to Zekrom. It is generally best used as a bulky Swords Dance user, although it can also pull off solid supporting and Calm Mind sets very well.</p>

<p>However, it is generally useless aside from Arceus, as most other Ground-types find the power boost from Earth Plate to be too menial.</p>

<h2>Location</h2> 
<p>Abyssal Ruins, 1F.</p>
