<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. This move ignores the target's defensive stat stage changes, including accuracy and evasion modifiers.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Since Defense-boosting moves are not that common, and evasion boosts are banned, Return is usually a better option for your Normal-type STAB move, as it's more powerful. It can be used for more damage against Bulk Up and Curse users, however, such as Conkeldurr, but this is situational at best.</p>
