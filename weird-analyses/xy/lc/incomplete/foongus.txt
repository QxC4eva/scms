Overview
########
-Bulk when equipped with an Eviolite, typing, and Regenerator allow Foongus to stay alive throughout the match thanks to Regenerator
-Has an excellent disruptive movepool which includes Spore, Stun Spore, and Clear Smog
-Spore and Stun Spore no longer work on opposing grass types, but grass types aren't too common
-Weakness to Flying-type moves is particularly bothersome due to the prevalence of Murkrow
-Not very bulky if Eviolite is removed due to low base stats, which is an issue because several Pokemon which Foongus walls carry Knock Off
-Mediocre damage output
-Slow, although this isn't overtly detrimental for a defensive Pokemon
-Reverted sleep mechanics make Spore less crippling

Pivot
########
name: Pivot
move 1: Spore
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Sludge Bomb / Clear Smog
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Stun Spore
ability: Regenerator
item: Eviolite
evs: 124 HP / 156 Def / 156 SDef
nature: Bold

Moves
========

-Spore allows Foongus to put one non-grass type enemy to sleep
-Giga Drain acts as Foongus's primary STAB move and helps extend Foongus's longevity
-Sludge Bomb allows Foongus to hit Snubbull, Snover, and opposing Foongus harder
-Clear Smog prevents Foongus from becoming set-up bait while also dealing a bit of damage, and has the bonus of going through Taunt
-Stun Spore is a secondary status move to paralyze faster Pokemon once Spore has been used
-Hidden Power Fire hits Magnemite and Ferroseed, as well as slightly outdamaging Sludge Bomb against opposing Foongus

Set Details
========

-Given EVs allow Foongus to reach 25 HP / 21 Def / 21 SDef after Eviolite, making Foongus very difficult to OHKO
-Eviolite is necessary to give Foongus reasonable bulk
-Regenerator allows Foongus to pivot more effectively

Usage Tips
========

-Walls fighting types who lack ice or psychic type moves and stops them from setting up by using Clear Smog
-Walls Chinchou for the most part
-Doesn't mind switching out of unfavourable match-ups repeatedly due to Regenerator
-Try to put something important to sleep, since sleep clause will only allow you to put one Pokemon to sleep
-Don't status Timburr or it'll be able to muscle through Foongus with guts-boosted Knock Off and Ice Punch
-Try to use your status on Pokemon who are negatively impacted by these status moves; paralyzing a Munchlax won't usually get you very far
-Taking out the opposing cleric will make Foongus's status moves more useful

Team Options
========

-Foongus fits into fire-water-grass cores well because it takes advantage of Regenerator by switching. Slowpoke in particular handles Foongus's fire, ice and psychic weaknesses while Foongus is able to deal with Slowpoke's grass and electric weaknesses, with a combination of the two completely shutting down fighting types; both have regenerator so they can switch back and forth easily, and Slowpoke greatly appreciates the removal of Toxic Spikes. Fighting types can take out steel types who wall Foongus, with Mienfoo in particular also possessing Regenerator for even more switching fun, although this will leave the team with a severe weakness to flying type moves. A combination of Foongus, Slowpoke, and Mienfoo creates an excellent Regenerator core with numerous resistances that can be incredibly difficult to break.
-Most Steel types, such as Pawniard are able to cover Foongus's flying, psychic and ice weaknesses. However, this leaves the team more susceptible to fire type attacks.
-Foongus with its numerous status moves makes a great partner for sweepers looking for a chance to set up.
-Defensive Tirtouga has great type synergy with Foongus, absorbing flying and fire type attacks aimed at Foongus while Foongus easily withstands fighting, grass and electric attacks that plague Tirtouga.
-Archen also resists flying and fire type attacks and is a good check for most Murkrow, which threatens Foongus severely.
-Foongus tends to force a lot of switches, so a rock or steel type who can set up Stealth Rock is beneficial.

Other Options
########

-Hidden Power Fighting hits Pawniard harder than Hidden Power Fire while also dealing a bit of damage to Magnemite, but is mostly ignorable for Ferroseed and opposing Foongus
-Synthesis acts as additional recovery, but is usually unnecessary
-Foul Play allows Foongus to do heavy damage against Pokemon with high Attack who are hit neutrally by dark type moves, such as Meditite, but lacks utility against the majority of the Pokemon Foongus is supposed to wall, which often either resist Foul Play or have low Attack
-Toxic cripples Lileep and Munchlax without Rest, but Stun Spore is better in almost every other scenario
-Venoshock could be used in tandem with Toxic or Toxic Spikes support to hit harder than Sludge Bomb or Clear Smog, but Foongus isn't going to do very much damage with its average Special Attack regardless

Checks & Counters
########

**Magic Bounce**:
-Natu is a complete stop to Foongus thanks to Magic Bounce and a resistance to Giga Drain as well as access to Roost to prevent it from being worn down and STAB Psychic and Flying type moves to defeat Foongus

**Grass types**:
-Ferroseed walls Foongus and can freely set up hazards on it
-Snover is immune to Spore, resists Giga Drain, and can deal heavy damage with Blizzard, with defensive variants not minding Stun Spore too much either thanks to Ice Shard, but will not enjoy repeatedly switching into Foongus's poison STAB repeatedly

**Sleep absorbers**:
-Munchlax doesn't mind sleep or paralysis too much and if it packs Rest and Sleep Talk, can wear Foongus down with Body Slam
-Defensive Mantyke with Rest and Sleep Talk is also able to wall Foongus and can use Air Slash to threaten Foongus

**Overcoat and Insomnia**:
-Overcoat carriers are immune to Foongus's status moves
-Vullaby in particular doesn't mind anything Foongus can throw at it, being able to Roost off any damage sustained, and can force Foongus out with STAB flying type moves
-Shelmet and Pineco are able to use Foongus to freely set up hazards
-Insomnia Murkrow is immune to Spore and OHKOs with Brave Bird most of the time even without Life Orb, but must be wary of Stun Spore

**Substitute users**:
-Substitute will be able to block Spore, and Foongus's low damage output may allow the Substitute to take more than one attack
-Notable examples include Misdreavus and Gastly

**Steel types**:
-Magnemite is immune to Stun Spore and Clear Smog and Foongus will be unable to hurt it significantly with Giga Drain, while Magnemite can heavily damage Foongus with Flash Cannon or Hidden Power Ice or Fire in return
-Pawniard doesn't mind Stun Spore too much thanks to Sucker Punch and can use Foongus as set-up bait
-Bronzor is naturally slow, and as such, isn't afraid of paralysis, and can threaten Foongus with STAB Psychic

**Fire types**:
-Houndour can easily switch in on Giga Drain and can wake up quickly from Spore thanks to Early Bird but will not want to be paralyzed by Stun Spore
-Once sleep clause is activated, Vulpix, Magby, Larvesta, Growlithe and Ponyta will be able to safely switch in on Giga Drain, but will also want to avoid Stun Spore
-Numel can wall Foongus with Stockpile and can hit Foongus with a STAB Lava Plume while not minding paralysis very much

**Flying types**:
-As previously mentioned, Vullaby is immune to Foongus's status moves and can force Foongus out with its STAB flying type attacks, while Murkrow works similarly but doesn't have an immunity to Stun Spore
-Once sleep clause has been activated, Fletchling and Drifloon can come in on Giga Drain and pummel Foongus with their flying type moves, but will also have to stay away from Stun Spore

-Keep in mind that simply forcing Foongus out is usually not very detrimental for Foongus due to Regenerator
