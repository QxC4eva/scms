
Overview
########

Fletchling, a cute bird with an incredibly powerful priority attack when it does not hold an item, uses its unique ability Gale Wings exceptionally well. It has decent Attack and Speed stats which it can make use of with its offensive sets. It also has access to Swords Dance, which can allow it to sweep. His defenses leave a little to be desired, but Fletchling can usually survive an attack or two. Its movepool isn’t that great, so it has few options and can be very predictable; most Steel-types can wall it. If you are searching for a late-game sweeper or a priority abuser, then Fletchling is a solid option for your team, though it does need entry hazard support.

Set Details
========

Fletchling is a pretty good pokemon for a late game sweep, because he can resist one hit or two thanks to Berry Juice or use the Normal gem and spam Acrobatics when most of his counters are dead or weak. Return is very good for secundary STAB, since it can hit harder Electric-type like Chinchou, who is 1HKOed after a Swords Dance and has a high percentage to kill him with the Normal Gem after Stealth Rock damage without any boost. The choose between Flame Charge and Steel Wings depends of your team, because if you have problems to dealt with some Rock-Types like Archen, Amaura and Tyrunt, the second one is a good option but he works better using Flame Charge, since he can 2HKO Pawniard, Ferroseed and has a chance against Honedge after a Swords Dance and they can’t 1HKO him back.

Usage Tips
========

The EV spread provides Fletchling opportunities to get a boost or attack while still being bulky enough to heal itself. Furthermore, it allows Fletchling to OHKO Murkrow with a +2 Acrobatics, which incidentally cannot OHKO Fletchling with Sucker Punch even with Life Orb. Fletchling can also 2HKO Pawniard, outspeeding it with the boost from Flame Charge and securing the KO with Acrobatics if it consumes its Berry Juice or with the help of Overheat instead of Flame Charge but without receiving the boost. Fletchling can survive Meditite’s Fake Out and Bullet Punch thanks to its item and OHKO back without a boost. Gligar has a hard time against this bird as well, because it can be 2HKOed by a boosted Acrobatics after Berry Juice is consumed or if it is itemless. This set is best used with hazard support because it allows Fletchling to secure some notable OHKOs and 2HKOs.

Team Options
========

One of the best teammates for Fletching is Chinchou, who can easy switch out with Volt Switch and gives a chance to boost against Grass-Type as Foongus. As well, a partner that can set up hazard is very useful too, like Ferroseed, Pawniard and Bronzor. Gothita and Magnemite are pretty good with Fletching too, since they can trap Steel-Type Pokemon and other ones that make his job hard. Rapid Spin or Defog support is appreciated, since he is weak to Stealth Rock and will be very hard for him to deal against priority attackers, so Stunky, Bergmite and Drilbur are good.

Set Details
========

This Fletchling is one of the best to cause a lot of switch and scout opponents team easy thanks to U-Turn, who permit him to stay safe against his main counters and sent the best pokemon for the situation. Thanks to acrobatics with priority this pokemon is an excelent revenge killer. He has a decent Special Attack to use thing such as Overheat and Hidden Power Grass, the first one is for Style-Type, hitting hard Pawniard, Bronzor, Ferroseed and Honedge; the second one is good for some teams that are weak against Omanyte and Tirtouga, since he can 2HKO and 1HKO respectively but Stealth Rock is needed to break Tirtouga’s ability. Substitute is another option the last slot if your team does well anyway against the pokemon mentioned before, giving a way to beat Sucker Punch users easier and to have a way to control Berry Juice.

Usage Tips
########

This set need to be as fast as posible even having priority move, since a U-Turn can be very useful to evade a hit while he does damage. As well, Fletchling will be using most of the time Acrobatics, so maximized attack is better than special attack. He can resist a hit by Pawniard’s and Murkrow’s Sucker Punch and you can Sub to be safe if you received Stealth Rock damage to prevent the hit anyway. Fletchling will be thankful of hazards support, since he can make a lot of switchs in the opponent side and KO some pokemon after some recoil because of Stealth Rock and Spikes.

Team Options
########

Ferroseed, Pawniard and Bronzor are good partners. It is perfect to use him with a volturn combo, so mates like Chinchou— Which provide very good synergy —and Mienfoo will be very useful at this work. A rapid spiner or defoger is helpful because of his Stealth Rock weakness, pairing him with Stunky, Bergmite, Drilbur and Gligar— Who can participate in the volturn combo —will be the best. Thanks to U-Turn, Gothita and Magnemite can be decent teammates, since you can trap easier.


Other Options
########
U-Turn is a useful option over Flame Charge or Steel Wing to switch out while you do damage and switching in something that can do better against the pokemon that trys to counter Fletchling. Substitute can work too in the first set, to have a control of Berry Juice and evade status moves such as Will-O-Wisp. Roost is a realiable way to heal Fletchling and will be good if he has Normal Gem or itemless but works too with Berry Juice.


Checks & Counters
########
One of the best counters for Fletchling is Archen, who can wall the all-out attacker set and check very well the Swords Dancer set, evading to be 1HKO’d if rocks aren’t up. Murkrow can take an unboosted Acrobatics and 1HKO back with Brave Bird or just kill him with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Steel-Type pokemon are pretty good checks such as Pawniard, Ferroseed, Bronzor, Honedge and Shieldon, all of them can take hits from Fletchling and do damage back. Tyrunt is another good check who can receive an attack and 1HKO back, same situation that happens with Misdreavuss. Chinchou, Shellder and Slowpoke counter very easy the all-out attacker set and dealt with the Swords Dance, doing 1HKO or 2HKO him. Finally, Tirtouga and Omanyte are one of the best counter for the Swords Dance set since they resist both STAB moves, Flame Charge and don’t get too much damage from Steel Wing, should be careful against the all-out attacker if Fletchling has Hidden Power Grass.
