Threat Discussion
[page]
<p>After the Typing Poll, the topic leader should post a thread asking questions about which Pokemon should be able to check or counter the CAP. Specifically, these questions should be posted in the OP:</p>

<div style="

	background-color: #E4E4FF;
	margin: 0 10em 2em 5em; 
	padding: 0 1em 0em 1em; 
	height: 20em; 
	overflow: auto;">
<ul>
<li><p>Going specifically by typing, what Pokemon found in the OU (or relevant) metagame will be able to comfortably give this CAP project trouble?</p></li>
<li><p>What Pokemon will be major threats to this project right off the bat?</p></li>
<li><p>What Pokemon have the potential to become counters?</p></li>
<li><p>What Pokemon may end up as threats, but must be contained or dealt with per the concept?</p></li>
<li><p>Will the concept succeed with these set list of threats?</p></li>
<li><p>Is this list of threats acceptable for the project?</p></li>
<li><p>What Pokemon will be threatened by the CAP based off of typing?</p></li>
<li><p>Are these Pokemon targets that we want CAP to hit?</p></li>
<li><p>Will these targets be "unavoidable" to threaten based solely on the typing?</p></li>
<li><p>What direction must the project go in now that a set list of basic threats has been identified?</p></li>
<li><p>What must be done in order to make these threats "wanted counters" or these threats be eliminated from counter discussion?</p></li>
<li><p>What Pokemon do we want this project to counter entirely?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Be aware that this list of questions is not a checklist, and not every question must be definitively answered in every response. </p>
