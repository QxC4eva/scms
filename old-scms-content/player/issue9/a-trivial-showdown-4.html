    <li>This user is the PS Global Moderator with the shortest name.</li>
  
    <li>This user made the Charizards background for PS.</li>
  
    <li>This user is the PS Administrator with the shortest name.</li>
  
    <li>This user was the main author of the PS Roomauth Guide.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Medium</h3>

    <li>This is the only move programmed into PS that doesn't have its max PP.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Hard</h3>

<ol>
    <li>This PS Global Moderator's Christmas avatar features Hatsune Miku.</li>
  
    <li>Of the BW-style animated sprites on PS, this Pok&eacute;mon's sprite has the biggest file size.</li>
  
    <li>This user is the former PS Global Moderator with the most likes on Smogon.</li>
</ol>
  
<h2>Puzzles</h2>

<div id="format" class="align-center"><p>Question: Hint</p></div>

<p><strong>Easy</strong> - Hangman. Fill out the rest of the word according to the hint.</p>

<ol>
    <li>_ _ _ _ L _ _ _ E _: PS public room.</li>
  
    <li>_ K _ _ _ _ _ _ _: Thanked on the PS Credits page.</li>
  
    <li>_ _ _ _ _ E _: Leader on PS.</li>
  
    <li>_ _ _ O _: Former Global Moderator on PS.</li>
  
    <li>_ _ X _ _ /_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _: Global Voice on PS.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Medium</strong> - Anagrams. Switch around the order of the letters to receive a PS-related answer. (ex. Need Hug Gun would be Hugendugen)</p>

<ol>
    <li>Laden Nerds: A room on PS.</li>
  
    <li>A Cleopatra Pen: An Other Meta.</li>
  
    <li>Hate Catnip: A Global Staff member on PS.</li>
  
    <li>Focal Waterpower: A PS Global Voice and a public room they own.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hard</strong> - "Psywaves" Questions. Use the clues to find synonyms that complete the full word. Be careful because this type of question is based on pronunciation. For example, when a clue is "A Letter," the letter may be "R" but spelled "ar" in the word. (ex. "Onomatopoeia + Hole + A Letter" would be Pupitar. Pew + Pit + Ar)</p>

<ol>
    <li>Center + Award: Battle format on PS.</li>
  
    <li>Impair + Letter: PS Global Staff member.</li>
  
    <li>Pronoun + Animal: PS Global Voice.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Bonus Question!</strong> - Combo Question. Follow the clues to reach a final answer!</p>

<p>1) Find the former PS Administrator/Leader with the fewest posts on the Smogon Forums and then find the user who posted the first VM on their profile. Take the National Pok&eacute;dex number of the Pok&eacute;mon in their avatar and add to it the TM number of Sleep Talk in Generation VI. Then find the Pok&eacute;mon with the National Pok&eacute;dex number of your result, and find the user who has that Pok&eacute;mon in their PS custom avatar and whose name starts with a letter in the second half of the alphabet. Find the issue of The Player in which this user was interviewed and find the user whose name was mentioned the most in the Contributors section of that issue. Then multiply the number of times that user was mentioned by the number of votes that user received in the poll about the best custom avatar on PS. The final answer is the Pok&eacute;mon whose weight in pounds is closest to that number.</p>
