[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 50% chance to burn the target. If the user is frozen, using this move will thaw it out immediately.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sacred Fire, Ho-Oh's signature move, should never be forgotten, and is one of the reasons Ho-Oh remains a threatening force in Ubers. Even with the prevalence of rain summoned by Drizzle Kyogre weakening Sacred Fire's power, it is sure to deal major damage to almost anything, and Brave Bird will hit what Sacred Fire does not for a ton of damage. Sacred Fire's amazing secondary effect in burning the opponent 50% of the time is something you could not possibly overlook, as it means that a physical attacker can almost never switch in, or it will easily become severely crippled for the rest of the game. Of course, the residual damage from burn is a great thing to have on any Pokemon in Ubers, even Palkia, who otherwise absorbs Sacred Fire due to its 4x resistance.</p>
