[SHORT DESC]
All Electric-type attacks hit this Pokémon. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>All Electric-type attacks, even those from your ally in 2v2, hit this Pokémon with 100% accuracy, regardless of the intended target. If a Pokemon with Lightningrod and a Pokemon using Follow Me are out at the same time, and a Pokemon uses an Electric-type attack targeted at the Follow Me user's team, Lightningrod will still take precedence and absorb the attack. Lightningrod never attracts Hidden Power, even if Hidden Power is Electric.</p>

<p>When a Pokémon with Lightningrod is present in your party in Emerald, the chance of you receiving an Entry Call on the Pokénav is increased.</p>
