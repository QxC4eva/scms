Set
#############
name: A [ORAS] Swampert
item: Swampertite
ability: Damp
evss: 100 HP / 252 Atk / 156 Spe
nature: Adamant
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Ice Punch

Pretty much Swampert that sets up Rain Dance for itself rather than relying on other mons. 156 speed outpaces Timid Sceptile, which is a good speed tier to be in imo. the standard one should probably stay with 252 Speed though to speed tie other base 70 that run max speed adamant like bisharp, but idk. damp is to switch into explosions or something - mostly irrelevant but Torrent is near useless since you're going to mega almost instantly.

(in response to above set) Jolly Mega Sceptile's Speed maxes at 427, so Mega Swampert only needs a Speed stat of 214 to outspeed it by 1 point in rain, which only requires 152 EVs with a neutral Speed nature. Also, Ice Punch is almost mandatory because both of its STABs are resisted by Grass-types. Rain Dance isn't a bad idea either, as it has the bulk to get it off, and it's almost like a Shift Gear boost for it, since it gives Waterfall a +1 boost and also doubles Mega Swampert's Speed. Stone Edge doesn't hit anything that the other attacks don't already hit, and Grass-types can switch in as they please and get a free turn if it doesn't have Ice Punch. With these things in consideration, a better set, in my opinion, is this:

Set
#############
name: A [ORAS Doubles] Swampert
item: Swampertite
nature: Adamant / Naughty
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def
move 1: Waterfall
move 2: Ice Punch / Ice Beam
move 3: Earthquake / Superpower
move 4: Protect

With its new Mega form, Swampert is finally a Pokémon that could be a dominating factor in the metagame. 150 base Attack in tandem with 100/110/110 defenses makes Swampert a very threatening tank. Being able to hit nearly every common Pokemon for super-effective damage with the correct set also helps. Waterfall is always going to be Swampert's main STAB, with Earthquake and an Ice move providing it with near perfect coverage. Superpower can also be used to hit Pokémon like Mega Kangaskhan and Ferrothorn.
