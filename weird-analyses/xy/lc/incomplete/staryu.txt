move 2: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 3: Ice Beam / Hidden Power Fire

ability: Natural Cure
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 36 HP / 200 SpA / 240 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
-Rapid Spin is obvious, one of the few good spinners in the tier
-Hydro Pump is STAB move of choice, obviously quite powerful
-Scald is good for a possible burn though
-Ice Beam hits most grass types for good damage, especially Lileep who can just switch in and set up rocks again.
-HP fire still hits grasses, but does much more to Ferroseed (2hkos) it's weak otherwise though.
-Recover is recover, keeps healthy
-Tbolt hits waters, especially frillish who spinblocks
-hp grass can also be used for waters, whilst hitting chinchou but is painfully weak.

Set Details
========
-max SpA / Speed should be obvious. dat 19 speed tier is sexy
-36 HP is filler
-20/18/18 stats after eviolite is decent enough.
-eviolite for recover set
-berry juice for non-recover

Usage Tips
========
-rapid spin when necessary of course
-otherwise just spam attacks
-easy to get in on fire types and weak walls like spritzee and slowpoke, doesn't mind -switching into status like wisp and toxic due to natural cure. thunderwave is still slightly irritating but it won't be crippled permanently

Team Options
========
-ANYTHING that appreciates rapid spin support
-something to beat chinchou, lileep and other grasses are cool
-something to take on grass types like lileep, ferro and foongus, fighters easily switch into the first two, fires easily switch into the latter two. fires also love staryu's spin support.
-pursuit support to take out ghost types for rapid spin. Pawniard can do this, so can stunky.

Life Orb Attacker
########
name: Life Orb Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Grass / Rapid Spin
ability: Natural Cure
item: Life Orb
evs: 200 SpA / 240 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
-HYDRO STRONG
-Ice Beam 2HKOs most grass (including Lileep & Foongus) except Ferroseed. I guess it hits the odd rare Dragon too.
-Thunderbolt is the best option against other waters that aren't Chinchou.
-HP fire 2HKOs Ferroseed, unfortunately can't OHKO though. Hydro+HP fire OHKOs after SR though.
-HP Grass has a small chance to 2HKO 76/228 Chinchou after Rocks, definitely 2hkos after rocks + 1 spikes layer.
-Rapid Spin can be used it you need it.

Set Details
========
Max Speed (19 speed tier), max SpA. No HP investment because of Life Orb recoil. If you're not using Hidden Power, you have room to add 76 EVs to Def.
Life Orb is Life Orb
Natural Cure means TWave can only stop it temporarily

Usage Tips
========
Get in safely and spam powerful moves basically
Cannot switch in very well, as it's quite frail.
Can be used as a wallbreaker early game as it's quite powerful and can sometimes lure some stuff with it's coverage.
but can also be saved to clean up thanks to its speed.

Team Options
========
-Really likes hazards. Dwebble and Ferro do this very well. Ferro also takes on Chinchou or other waters that could cause it some trouble. Lileep sets up rocks and does the same.
-things to switch in on other water types like the aforementioned ferro+lileep, also chinchou does this well.
-Something to switch in to take on grass types like fire and flying

Other Options
########
-Rain Dance- gets powerful STAB + Thunder
-psychic surprises gunk
-dual screens
-reflect type is lolz vs. grass types
-surf
-analytic - illegal with hydro and rapid spin but powerful for switch-ins.
-rest + natural cure - usually outclassed by recover
