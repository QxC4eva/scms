<p>As the name suggests, this is a project whose main objective is the following: to translate the content developed during the  fourth generation era that was created by the plethora of contributors who visit our website, Smogon.com, on a daily basis.</p>

<p>For several months, the founders of this project&mdash;<a href="/forums/member.php?u=29254">Bloo</a> and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=32828">Setsuna</a>&mdash;along with the help of <a href="/forums/member.php?u=17916">RockinX</a>, have been working diligently in hopes of bringing this project into the public's eye for all to see. Below, you'll find further information about this project and what the future holds in store for it later down the road.</p>

<p>Smogon is a relatively large website that encompasses players of all nationalities, many of whom come from various Spanish-speaking countries situated in Latin America and Europe. As such, having the option of reading our on-site content in Spanish, the third most spoken language in the world, may prove to be quite useful and convenient for many individuals across the globe.</p>

<p>The principal object of our translations consists of the <a href="/dp/types/">Types</a> / <a href="/dp/moves/">Moves</a> / <a href="/dp/items/">Items</a> / <a href="/dp/abilities/">Abilities</a> / <a href="/dp/natures/">Natures</a> pages, three of which have been  translated and placed on-site. The reason that these pages have taken priority over the other pages is simple: the content located on these pages will <em>always</em> be useful, regardless of the number of new editions that Pokémon games bring to life. Quite the opposite occurs with the multitude of competitive analyses and guides scattered around Smogon, mainly because they become outdated as the metagame grows and develops over time. For your viewing pleasure, you'll find a panel that contains all of the information previously mentioned to the left of this page.</p>

<p>There are numerous countries where Pokémon is marketed only in English. Therefore, we understand that the sheer amount of Spanish terms can be confusing for many. In spite of this, we've included the English names of each term, alongside their translated name, to make our content easier to absorb. If you're browsing through the material located throughout this portion of our website, you may come across some italicized words. There is, of course, a reason for this. Coined terms, such as 'set-up,' don't have a direct translation in Spanish. Due to this, they have been italicized in order to indicate that the terms are foreign. The italicized words you'll find are known by nearly every individual who is involved with competitive Pokémon, so do not be surprised if you happen to see one. Finally, there are many instances where a reference to an ability, Pokémon, typing, or move has been made within a description. For now, we've linked to their English pages; however, when we develop their Spanish translated brethren, we will change the links appropriately.</p>

<p>With that said, we invite you, the reader, to make full use of this newly created section of our website. In the near future, there will be a sub-forum where everyone is welcome to actively contribute to this project, so stay tuned for what's to come!</p>
