Overview
########

Scizor's unprecedented versatility and resiliency gives it a huge presence on any team, and its extremely flexible Mega Evolution has both the power, bulk, and utility to back it up. Offensively, Swords Dance allows Scizor to rip through opposing teams with boosted attacks, most notably STAB Technician Bullet Punch, one of the strongest priority attacks the tier has to offer. With great coverage in Knock Off, Bug Bite, and Superpower, Scizor has no trouble powering through opponents of any kind. Adding Pursuit, U-turn, and a Choice Band, Scizor can turn its sweeping capabilities into that of a revenge killer, pivot, and Pursuit-trapper. All of this comes off of a staggering base 130 Attack, boosted to 150 through Mega Evolution. Defensively, Scizor turns out to be one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier, with an amazing base 140 Defense and 100 Special Defense, backed up by a solid HP stat that can be easily invested in even on offensive sets, thanks to Bullet Punch covering speed issues. Its typing gives it only one weakness, as compared to its eight resistances and 1 immunity. Roost gives it the reliable recovery it needs to outlast its opponents, as well as boost without fear of being worn down. However, having bulk greater than that of Skarmory is put to great use on support sets utilizing Defog or Baton Pass. No matter the role, Scizor usually has the capability to pull it off.

However, like any other Pokemon, Scizor still has its fair share of checks and balances. Its nasty double weakness to Fire-type attacks can prevent it from doing its job, and Scizor requires team support to take care of this Achilles heel. Having lost some of its resistances, Scizor can no longer switch into Ghost- and Dark-type attacks like it used to with impunity, and once Scizor's set is revealed it is often forced to play rather predictably. As an offensive Pokemon, Scizor is mostly held back by its slow speed, and even though Bullet Punch can somewhat rectify this weakness, Lastly, Scizor can be somewhat easily walled by the likes of Skarmory and Mandibuzz, and its attempts to boost will simply be nullified with Whirlwind and Foul Play, respectively. Despite these setbacks, however, Scizor remains a major force in the OU metagame and will easily carry its weight on a team.


Bulky Swords Dance
########
name: Bulky Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Roost
move 3: Bullet Punch
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
nature: Adamant
evs: 248 HP / 136 Def / 104 SpD / 20 Spe

Moves
========

Swords Dance allows Scizor to easily sweep teams, and thanks to this set's focus on bulk, will have ample opportunities to set up. Roost allows Scizor to set up anything that cannot 2HKO it, such as Garchomp lacking Fire Blast or Excadrill, and prevents Scizor from being worn down before it can sweep. Bullet Punch is Scizor's main attacking move, packing an effective base 60 power thanks to Technician and making up for Scizor's nearly uninvested Speed. Knock Off allows Scizor to get a solid hit on many Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch, such as Rotom-W, and can also be of use to cripple common switch-ins to Scizor such as Heatran. In the last slot, another coverage move such as Superpower or Bug Bite may be used. However, Superpower's defense drops and inability to hit Aegislash can severely hinder Scizor's sweep, and Bug Bite, while immensely powerful, gets very poor coverage alone with Bullet Punch.

Set Details
========

The EVs may seem complicated, but their purpose is to allow Scizor to set up on specific threats. 248 HP EV investment makes Scizor as bulky as possible while reducing Stealth Rock damage, and 136 Defense EVs and 104 Special Defense EVs prevent Scizor from being 2HKO'd by anything weaker than Adamant Excadrill's Earthquake and Aegislash's Shadow Ball, respectively. 20 Speed EVs allow Scizor to outspeed minimum speed Heatran. Scizorite is the main item, as Mega Scizor's bulk and extra power are too good to pass up, even for Leftovers. Finally, Light Metal is the ability of choice because Mega Scizor will be Mega Evolving immediately, taking advantage of Technician only after Mega Evolution. Prior to that, however, Light Metal allows regular Scizor to take slightly less damage switching in to Grass Knot and Low Kick. Albeit situational, it is the only ability with tangible benefit to Scizor before it Mega Evolves.

Usage Tips
========

Although Scizor can certainly come out early- to mid-game against easy targets like Sylveon, Scizor should not be attempting a boost until all of its Fire-type counters are either removed or weakened enough for Scizor to KO at +2 with Bullet Punch or Knock Off. This holds true for its defensive counters, such as Skarmory, as well, and in many cases going straight for an unboosted Knock Off will be far more beneficial as it makes these counters much easier to wear down. Due to the bulky EV investment, Scizor can set up against many prominent threats on both the physical and special side, including foes like Garchomp, Mega Tyranitar, Conkeldurr, and Aegislash, often attaining 2 or sometimes even 3 boosts before sweeping.

Team Options
========

Teammates that can easily wear down or take out foes such as Heatran, Rotom-W, Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz are highly appreciated, as all of these Pokemon can prevent a Scizor sweep. Kyurem-B stands out in particular, as it shares a decent degree of defensive synergy with Scizor, and it easily takes out every one of the aforementioned Pokemon. Heatran with Earth Power itself is a nice partner, sponging any Fire-type attacks aimed in Scizor's direction, taking out opposing Heatran, and wearing Zapdos and Rotom-W down with Toxic. Excadrill also has a decent matchup against the aforementioned Pokemon, although it cannot switch in on any of them. A Stealth Rock and possibly Spikes user is also great, wearing down the opponent and making it much easier for Scizor to sweep with Bullet Punch.


Offensive Swords Dance
########
name: Offensive Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Bullet Punch
move 3: U-turn / Bug Bite
move 4: Knock Off / Superpower
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Swords Dance allows Scizor to easily boost itself into a fearsome attacker, doubling its Attack stat in a single turn. Bullet Punch returns as Scizor's Steel-type STAB move of choice, easily dismantling the faster Pokemon that might attempt to check it. U-turn may seem like an odd choice on a boosting set, but thanks to Scizor's full investment in Speed and Attack, it allows Scizor to boost up even if some of its slower checks (such as Rotom-W) are still alive, hitting them with a boosted U-turn. On the other hand, Bug Bite is a stronger, more consistent attack that won't force Scizor to switch out, but its coverage isn't superb. Notably, however, Bug Bite can OHKO Rotom-W after just a single layer of Stealth Rock. Knock Off is Scizor's best coverage move, hitting many Pokemon alongside Bullet Punch for neutral or super effective damage, but Superpower can be used as it easily takes out Heatran and is Scizor's strongest attack against Skarmory, doing about 60% to it on average. Note, however, that Scizor has no way of getting past Aegislash without Knock Off.

Set Details
========

Full investment in Attack and Speed allows Scizor to outspeed many threats, including defensive variants of Heatran, Rotom-W, and Mega Venusaur, along with Jolly Mega Tyranitar, and hit them with powerful attacks to bring them down. An Adamant nature is chosen to give Scizor more power, as Bullet Punch is generally strong enough to take out the faster, frailer threats in the OU tier after they have been worn down. Scizorite is the item of choice, as the extra power, bulk, and speed help Scizor in both sweeping and setting up. However, if a Mega slot is already used up, a Life Orb can be used instead, although the benefits of Scizorite will be missed. Light Metal allows Scizor to take slightly less damage from Grass Knot and Low Kick before it Mega Evolves.


Usage Tips
========

Because Roost is not on this set, it's important to preserve Scizor's health, particularly if Life Orb is being used. For that reason, it should be sent out mid- to late-game and kept for sweeping purposes, although it can come out earlier to gain momentum with U-turn or threaten a switch-in with Knock Off if it will take little damage in the process. Once a sweeping opportunity presents itself, Scizor should be sent out to start boosting. Ideally, Scizor should be setting up against Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur or Sylveon that cannot do much to it as it sets up. It's important that Scizor's counters, namely Pokemon such as Skarmory or Hidden Power Fire Greninja, be removed or weakened before it attempts a sweep. Without any investment in bulk or Roost, it's harder for Scizor to come back in later in the match and sweep again.


Team Options
========

Aegislash and Terrakion are good teammates as they easily break down one anothers' counters to start a sweep. Keldeo is a great partner, easily weakening Heatran, Skarmory, and Landorus-T, whereas Keldeo's common switch-ins such as Mega Venusaur or Sylveon tend to be total setup bait for Scizor. Stealth Rock and Spikes support from the likes of Deoxys-D can be invaluable to getting a sweep going, easily wearing down the opponent's team. Rotom-W is a great partner for its access to Volt Switch, easily forming a VoltTurn core with Scizor. In addition, a burnt enemy is very easy for Scizor to set up on. Finally, because this Scizor has no way of recovering and has less bulk than other variants, a Defog or Rapid Spin partner such as Latias (who shares decent defensive synergy with Scizor) can aid greatly in setting up. Although less reliable, Wish and Healing Wish support from Pokemon like Sylveon and Latias, respectively, can be used to give Scizor a second chance at sweeping.


Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: U-turn
move 2: Bullet Punch
move 3: Knock Off / Pursuit
move 4: Superpower
ability: Technician
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD

Moves
========

Choice Band Scizor carries the strongest unboosted U-turn in the tier, allowing it to dish out massive damage while also providing momentum for its team. Similarly, with a Choice Band, Scizor's Bullet Punch becomes one of the strongest priority attacks available and makes Scizor into a great revenge killer capable of stopping the likes of Belly Drum Azumarill and Gengar. Knock Off provides a strong coverage attack that can cripple many switch-ins, particularly Skarmory and Heatran, and can easily put the opponent in a no-win situation. Pursuit, on the other hand, allows Scizor to trap Latias, Latios, non-King's Shield Aegislash, and Gengar, putting a definite end to their use. Finally, Superpower allows Scizor to OHKO any incoming Heatran, as well as do massive damage to the likes of Conkeldurr and Rotom-W.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in HP and Attack ensures that Scizor is bulky enough to be used several times in a match while letting it hit as hard as possible. Specifically, 248 HP EVs are used to lessen damage from Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are thrown into Special Defense, the lower of Scizor's two defense stats. An Adamant nature ensures that Scizor hits as hard as possible. Choice Band is the only item considered, as it gives Scizor the highest power boost possible, and Scizor doesn't usually have to change moves.

Usage Tips
========

Scizor finds many opportunities to enter the battle with its respectable mixed bulk and threatening attacks. Whenever one of its attacks is needed, Scizor can be send out to perform the appropriate duty, and its bulk often permits it to switch into attacks. A well-planned dual switch is often extremely rewarding, as few Pokemon outside of select defensive walls want to switch into Scizor's U-turn or Knock Off. Although this set can be played fairly liberally, make sure to conserve Scizor's HP if necessary, as it has no method of recovery and can be worn down by entry hazards.

Team Options
========

Users of Volt Switch and U-turn, such as Rotom-W and Landorus-T, can be used to form a highly effective VoltTurn core with Scizor. Rapid Spin or Defog support is highly suggested, as Scizor will be doing a lot of switching. A wallbreaker such as Kyurem-B can be helpful in breaking down the few Pokemon that can safely switch into Scizor, namely Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Mandibuzz. As always, Heatran is a great partner due to its easy absorption of Fire-type attacks, which Scizor will encounter frequently. If used as part of a VoltTurn core, a late-game cleaner such as Choice Band Talonflame or Mega Pinsir is often effective as a way to sweep the remnants of the opponent's team, as VoltTurn strategies often tend to spread damage very evenly throughout a team. Finally, entry hazards are a vital part of Choice Band Scizor's gameplay, as many of Scizor's checks, such as Charizard and Talonflame, are severely weakened by it, and works well with Scizor's tendency to force switches.


Defog
########
name: Defog
move 1: Defog
move 2: Roost
move 3: Bullet Punch / Knock Off
move 4: U-turn
ability: Technician
item: Scizorite
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def

Moves
========

Defog is the main move and focal point of this set, as Scizor is an extremely bulky and reliable Defog user. Roost is mandatory, keeping Scizor healthy through the duration of the match, allowing it to Defog more than once. The third slot is dedicated to whichever move fits the team better: Bullet Punch allows Scizor to revenge kill weak Pokemon and threaten Fairy-types, while Knock Off provides all-around utility and a deterrent to Pokemon dependent on their items, such as Heatran. Finally, U-turn allows Scizor to pivot out once it has Defogged, and can be useful to grab momentum when Defog is not necessary. As this set does not invest in any speed, its great bulk and slow U-turn allow many frail Pokemon a free switch-in.

Set Details
========

By maxing out its HP and Defense, Scizor becomes bulkier than even Skarmory, easily taking hits from ferocious physical attackers such as Excadrill and Bisharp, with the remaining 4 EVs invested in Attack for a slight boost to its attacking moves. An Impish nature is chosen as it raises Scizor's Defense through the roof without lowering the power of its attacking moves. Scizorite is the primary item, as Scizor becomes significantly bulkier after Mega Evolution. However, should another Mega Evolution already be on the team, Leftovers can be used, although the loss in bulk is usually not worth it.

Usage Tips
========

Scizor can be sent out against almost all physical attackers without a Fire-type move and gain a free turn to use Defog. Because this is set is not as commonly seen as the other sets listed above it, bluffing an offensive set will also often gain free turns, and switching into Pokemon like Sylveon and Chansey can also gain free turns. Although this set's primary role is to use Defog, its sheer defensive prowess allows it to act as a physical wall as well, acting as a full stop to several powerful physical attackers including non-Swords Dance Garchomp and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Beware, however, that without super effective coverage, Scizor may not be able to rack up enough damage on some physical attackers to prevent them from boosting in front of Scizor, particularly Swords Dance Excadrill and Bulk Up Thundurus. Make sure your team has a way to handle these boosting threats other than with Scizor, either through revenge killers or walls with phazing capabilities.

Team Options
========

Although one usually thinks of Choice Band Scizor when considering members of a VoltTurn team, this Scizor set is actually also a great choice as it provides the Defog support that VoltTurn teams require. Note, however, that VoltTurn teams like to have their own entry hazards up as well, so Scizor should always be paired with a teammate such as Landorus-T that can be a reliable setter of Stealth Rock. Frailer attackers such as Gengar appreciate Scizor's slow U-turn to enter the battle safely; many of them, such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, immensely appreciate the Defog support as well. As always, Heatran is a perfect teammate as it not only sponges up Fire-type attacks, but also has great stat synergy with defensive Scizor, as Heatran commonly runs a specially defensive set and will complement Scizor's great physical bulk.

Baton Pass
############
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Iron Defense / Swords Dance
move 3: Substitute / Roost
move 4: Bullet Punch
item: Scizorite
ability: Light Metal
evs: 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Baton Pass is obviously required, as this Scizor set is designed to be used on full Baton Pass teams in which members pass boosts along in a long chain. Depending on the team, Scizor can use either Iron Defense or Swords Dance, carrying whichever move the team needs more. Iron Defense is the more orthodox option, as it not only allows Scizor to boost in the face of many prominent physical attackers, but is also more helpful to the other members of the team, as most of them cannot utilize physical boosts. However, Swords Dance is great in that it makes Scizor's Bullet Punch terrifyingly strong, strong enough to sweep on its own, and allows the team to be much less dependent on Espeon for a final sweep. In the second slot, Substitute protects Scizor from critical hits and makes it much easier to pull off a safe pass to a teammate. However, the lack of Leftovers means Scizor will have to rely on teammates to pass other forms of recovery, namely Wish, Aqua Ring, and Ingrain. On the other hand, while Roost makes Scizor susceptible to physical hits, it makes Scizor's time boosting a lot easier, particularly in the early stage of a match when not many boosts have been acquired and attacks may do more damage than Scizor could safely handle without instant Recovery. Finally, Bullet Punch not only acts as a deterrent to opposing setup sweepers, but is also one of the few ways that Baton Pass teams can sneak past Prankster Taunt users.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP and Special Defense investment balances out Scizor's defenses, especially considering that Scizor cannot boost its Special Defense on its own. 248 HP EVs minimizes Stealth Rock damage. The rest is thrown into Attack, to give Scizor an incrementally stronger Bullet Punch. A Careful nature adds to Scizor's Special Defense, and Light Metal minimizes Grass Knot and Low Kick damage before Scizor Mega Evolves. If another Mega Evolution is being used, Leftovers can be put in place of Scizorite, but Scizor loses a considerable amount of bulk by forfeiting its Mega stone.

Usage Tips
========

Ideally, Scizor should always boost with a few Speed boosts already under its belt, as it not only allows Scizor to boost before it gets hit, but also allows Scizor a quick getaway should a strong Fire-type attacker such as Mega Charizard Y switch in. Scizor should boost from behind a Substitute whenever possible, as critical hits will bypass Scizor's boosts and possibly threaten a KO. Before Scizor tries to boost, it's a good idea to have Aqua Ring or Ingrain passed to it, as it not only allows Scizor to create more Substitutes, but also takes pressure off of using Roost (should Scizor carry it) so it can spend time boosting instead. Remember, a high number of boosts does not make Scizor invincible. No matter how many Defense or Special Defense boosts Scizor has, it should never stay in on Fire-type attackers without the protection of a Substitute.

Team Options
========

As with any Baton Pass team, several members are mandatory to ensure a safe and successful pass. Scolipede is invaluable for its ability Speed Boost and ability to quickly pass Defense boosts at the beginning of a match. Espeon is also mandatory, blocking phazing moves and Taunt, as well as Mr. Mime to block Perish Song and Roar. Mew, Celebi, and Mawile, Vaporeon, and Gliscor can provide boosts as well as valuable utility moves such as Taunt, Roar, and Aqua Ring. Although Smeargle's low stats are unappealing, it has access to several niche moves including Ingrain and Spore that can give it merit on a Baton Pass team.

Other Options
########

Acrobatics is a strong Flying-type move that can hit Keldeo, who resists all of Scizor's other attacks except for the occasionally seen Superpower. However, it prevents Scizor from holding an item, and doesn't work with Scizor's Mega Evolution. Aerial Ace can be used instead, but its low base power along with its relatively redundant coverage prevent it from being of much use over Scizor's other moves. Tailwind can be used to support Scizor's team, and while defensive Scizor is a reliable user of the move with a slow U-turn to get nearly any attacker in safely, Tailwind's short duration makes it rather hard to abuse, especially in a relatively bulky metagame. Finally, Choice Scarf Scizor can afford to forego Bullet Punch for a stronger Iron Head, and can outspeed most unboosted attackers. However, Scizor loses a considerable amount of power, and does not fare well for a Pokemon that frequently relies on its unSTABbed coverage moves to hit certain targets.

Checks & Counters
########

- **Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X and Heatran can hit Scizor for 4x super effective damage with their STAB moves, easily taking out even the bulkiest of Scizor variants. Attackers with Fire-type coverage moves are also extremely dangerous, particularly on Pokemon such as Tyranitar or Garchomp who may try to lure Scizor in.

- **Steel-types**: Steel-types resist both of Scizor's STABs, and therefore must be taken care of by one of Scizor's coverage moves. In particular, a healthy Skarmory does not mind taking Superpower or Knock Off under most circumstances.

- **Bulky Ground-types**: Hippowdon does not usually mind Scizor, phazing it out and recovering the damage with Slack Off, although it does not enjoy taking a boosted Knock Off or Bug Bite. Landorus-T and Gliscor, while able to wall Choice Band and defensive variants, can be brought down by the stronger and more threatening Swords Dance variants.

- **Bulky Water-types**: Defensive Rotom-W can live most of Scizor's attacks other than a +2 Bug Bite after Stealth Rock, and proceed to cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Suicune can take any of Scizor's unboosted attacks and set up with Calm Mind, but variants without Roar can be overpowered by Swords Dance variants if they do not obtain a Scald Burn.

- **Physical Walls**: Physical walls can easily handle Scizor, though some, such as Gliscor and Hippowdon without Whirlwind, will lose to Swords Dance variants. However, physical walls with phazing moves and/or Foul Play, in addition to Unaware Quagsire, will have trouble with Scizor provided they are healthy and confront it before it boosts too far.
