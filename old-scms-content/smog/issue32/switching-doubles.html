<p>Too often, I hear "switching is rare in Doubles." Yet when you see high-level matches, sometimes they average one switch per turn or more! Why is there such a disconnect from initial perception and reality? Well, there are a few reasons:</p>

<ol><li><p><strong>A lot of people use BW2 VGC as a gauge for what to expect.</strong> There are two things wrong with that. In the shift from BW2 to XY, we lost elemental gems, which have served to slow the pace for a lot of teams and make switching more worthwhile. Also, one of the key differences between Smogon Doubles and VGC is that you can use six Pok&eacute;mon! Because of this, your team will be packing Pok&eacute;mon that can switch in with little cost much more often, and the risk is smaller because a Pok&eacute;mon is only one-sixth of your team.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Initial perceptions are gauged on an inexperienced ladder.</strong> You often find gimmicks that boost your opponent to +6 in a single turn, which makes it disadvantageous for either of you to switch. Also, if your opponents aren't usually switching, you may be inclined to label switches as uncommon.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Switching sometimes comes with huge opportunity costs.</strong> A switch could mean not being able to do anything while your two opponents have a turn to do whatever they want. As such, it takes familiarity with the metagame to evaluate when is a good time to switch. This could result with unfamiliar battlers steering away from the mechanic altogether and lowering their chances at success.</p></li></ol>

<p>Let's get straight to the point: why should you switch? Well, the simplest answer is "to put yourself in a more favorable position." A more favorable position could be having Heatran out against Charizard rather than Amoonguss, or it could mean having Cresselia out against Hitmontop. In order to help evaluate when to switch and how to be successful at it, here is an outline of advice as well as common scenarios.</p>

<h3>Evaluate Opportunity Cost</h3>
<p>Before you switch, figure out if it is a good idea. Think, is switching worth the damage your Pok&eacute;mon could do this turn instead? Is switching worth the damage your Pok&eacute;mon could take? Is switching worth the free turn you could be giving up? You even have to consider whether switching early-game is worth letting the opponent into your head because you showed what you consider a simple prediction. It might not be so simple the second time it happens. If you can answer yes to all of these questions or you have evaluated the scenario and switching is the most cost-effective option, then you have already decided the appropriate next step.</p>

<p>For example, there is rarely a scenario that I will not switch in a Grass-type tank against Politoed and Kingdra. Even though my tank is at the threat of Draco Meteor, Ice Beam, and Hypnosis on the switch, I evaluate the scenario and realize that tanking neutral or super effective Hydro Pumps and Muddy Waters with what is already in is usually not worth it. I also make sure that my partner targets Kingdra so that it can't Substitute freely and use the switch against me.</p>

<h3>Build your team with defensive synergy</h3>
<p>If you have a Heatran out, but the opponent has a Landorus-T out, then you can probably figure out what is going to happen next. However, if your Heatran just used Protect, are you really going to risk a double Protect early-game when there is only a one-third chance of it succeeding? You're probably hoping at this point that you remembered to pack a Flying-type or Levitate Pok&eacute;mon to come in free of charge.</p>

<p>The key to Doubles, though, is that two Pok&eacute;mon have to eat that Landorus-T's Earthquake, two Pok&eacute;mon have to tank that Mega Charizard-Y's Heat Wave. Also, you have to be wary that either of your Pok&eacute;mon are at risk to that Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird or Rotom-W's Hydro Pump, not just one. In addition, both of your Pok&eacute;mon are under the threat of TWO opponents, not just one. This is where teambuilding can get pretty tricky and why Rotom-W is so good. Let's take a look at our favorite washing machine. It has one uncommon weakness (Grass), an immunity to Ground, and resistances to Steel, Flying, Water, Fire, and Ice. In order to be in a favorable position using Rotom-W, you simply need to not be up against any Grass-types or let it be accompanied by a Pok&eacute;mon that poses a serious threat to Grass-types. That's something to think about when teambuilding, but how does this apply to switching?</p>

<p>Well, thanks to its resistances and bulk, Rotom-W can switch in on a whopping six different types, while only being forced out by one. If you partner Rotom-W with Heatran, Rotom-W can tag in for Heatran against Landorus-T while Heatran can tag in against Ferrothorn. If Ferrothorn and Landorus-T are BOTH out, then you can get crafty. Switching Rotom-W to Hitmontop and Protecting with Heatran can put you in a position to threaten the opponent with Fake Out and Heat Wave, while Landorus-T is already neutered with -1 Attack.</p>

<p>Although you can check a Pok&eacute;mon with a single Pok&eacute;mon, sometimes you need THREE or more Pok&eacute;mon to effectively counter one. Keep this in mind when building your teams and do not only carry one check to top threats or you will fair poorly.</p>

<ul><li><p><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong> Your back-up tanks anything either of the opponents can throw at it and you aren't in a favorable position already. Hey, if this happens, SWITCH! No sense at all in leaving a Pok&eacute;mon in to die or do little damage when you have back-ups waiting in the wings. Heatran and Rotom-W have been brought up a lot so far, and that is because they are unique for having this situation happen often to them.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong> Switch because of what your partner is about to do. If your Landorus-T is about to spam Earthquakes, switch to a Pok&eacute;mon immune to it. If your Hitmontop is about to use Fake Out on a slower Pok&eacute;mon that threatens your switch-in, but your switch-in can OHKO said threat, there is your opportunity. If your Pok&eacute;mon is about to use a fast Heal Pulse, feel free to switch in something to take advantage of it. Finally, if your partner threatens to KO your switch-in's check, it looks like you got yourself a switch-in opportunity.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Predict Fake Out, Protect, Wide Guard, and Taunt:</em></strong> These moves are widely regarded as some of the most powerful moves in Doubles, but they all have one thing in common: they serve absolutely no purpose if the opponent switches that turn. Of course, you should evaluate risk versus reward and likelihood of the moves, but if you want a "free" switch to gain yourself some extra momentum, then take advantage. It sure beats sitting there and watching your Pok&eacute;mon unable to attack in the case of Protect and Fake Out.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Generate momentum:</em></strong> You may notice that when you switch into a favorable position, the opponent has to either suck it up or switch as well. This nabs you free turns and is also why Rotom-W and Heatran are great. You can use that switch to set up a Substitute with the popular SubTran or screw over the opponent with a Will-O-Wisp, Volt Switch, or Electro Web from Rotom-W.</p>

<p>The key to switching is to make it safe for you, but punishing for the opponent. Reactivating Fake Out and Intimidate are also examples of utilizing momentum.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong> Your opponent is doing something that can actually benefit you. There are loads of abilities and some of them have "turn your opponent against themselves" traits. If your opponent has Tyranitar out and you want the sandstorm to help out your Terrakion, go ahead (maybe you can activate Justified on the Crunch too). If you see a Hydro Pump coming your way, redirect it with a Storm Drain switch-in and take that power boost. They're probably not going to use Hydro Pump once you have already switched in, so your best bet for a power boost is on the switch.</p></li></ul>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<div>
    <strong>Your team:</strong> Gardevoir / Heatran / Rotom-W / Breloom / Hitmontop / Jirachi<br/>
    <strong>Opponent's team:</strong> Amoonguss / Landorus-T / Gallade / Rotom-W / Heatran / Scizor
</div>

<p>Go! Hitmontop!<br/>
Go! Heatran!<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
Opponent sent out Scizor!<br/>
Opponent sent out Amoonguss!</p>

<div class="explain"><p>In this situation, Scizor has absolutely zero reason to stay in. Heatran is capable of melting it, it has -1 Attack, Hitmontop still has its Fake Out, and it poses minimal threat to the other team. This is an obvious switch.</p>

<p>Amoonguss can tank a Heat Wave and wall Hitmontop while threatening with Spore, although it is in a highly unfavorable position. Amoonguss can't do anything to Heatran, and Hitmontop hasn't used Fake Out yet.</p>

<p>So we can deduce that Scizor and Amoonguss are in unfavorable positions, Hitmontop is in an ok position, and Heatran has a completely free turn as it is not yet threatened.</p>

<p>Let's find out what happens next.</p></div>
<br/>
<p>Hitmontop, come back!<br/>
Go! Breloom!<br/>
Opponent withdrew Scizor!<br/>
Opponent sent out Rotom-W!<br/>
The opposing Amoonguss used <strong>Protect!</strong><br/>
Heatran used <strong>Substitute!</strong></p>

<p>Heatran capitalizes on the free turn in the best way, but the opponent switches in their best Heatran check. Since you know that Rotom-W is their best Heatran check and your Hitmontop is at the risk of Spore, you smartly bring in Breloom. The momentum is now largely in your favor because you mastered the art of smart switching. Never again will you make the rookie mistake of drooling at the prospect of Heat Wave giving you a quick advantage and the debilitating potential of Fake Out.</p>
