Lowers target's Attack by 2 stages.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Attack by two stages. Pokemon with the abilities Clear Body or Hyper Cutter are immune. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>It's a shame that most of the Pokemon that receive FeatherDance can't do much with it. The ability to cushion attacks is always fine and dandy, but most of the Pokemon that get it, such as Staraptor and Blaziken, would rather be smashing in their foes' faces than lowering their stats. The only viable user of this move is Murkrow. With an Eviolite boost, as well as the moves Roost and FeatherDance, which gain priority thanks to Prankster, Murkrow can take even the strongest of hits surprisingly well. Magic Bounce Xatu can also use the move, but it usually prefers to set up Reflect and switch out with U-turn for a fellow teammate to set up.</p>
