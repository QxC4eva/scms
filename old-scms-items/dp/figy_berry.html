<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Restores 1/8 max HP when the holder has 50% HP or less. Confuses Pokemon with a -Attack nature (Bold, Calm, Modest, Timid) upon activation. One-time use. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Bug-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Figy Berry's double-edged strategy may seem highly useful in theory (it discourages Thief, Trick, and Pluck while restoring HP), but few Pokemon are actually able to take advantage of its effects. The amount of HP restored is much less than what could be restored turn after turn via Leftovers and with the exception of Trick, none of the moves listed above are commonly seen in competitive play. Therefore, it is recommended that you choose a more conventional item, such as <a href="/dp/items/leftovers">Leftovers</a>, <a href="/dp/items/life_orb">Life Orb</a>, or a Choice item.</p>
