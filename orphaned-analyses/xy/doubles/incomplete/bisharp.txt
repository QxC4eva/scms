Overview
########
Cool af atm
Defiant is pretty sweet since it prevents common Intimidate Pokemon like Landorus-T from switchin in
Knock Off buff also works in its favor by makin it harder to switch into
High Attack + Good STAB combo = frightening
Has middling speed though
Sucker Punch helps it get around faster Pokemon to make up for this
Is also weak to common attacking types like Fighting, Fire, and Ground
all in all a total baller though

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Protect
ability: Defiant
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spd
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Sucker Punch is for use against threats that would otherwise be faster or to beat slower mons w/ priority
Iron Head is a nice secondary STAB, hits most threats for good damage as well as hittin things like TTar and Togekiss for SE
Knock Off is sweet since it's more reliable than Sucker Punch, hits harder, and makes the opponent lose their item
Protect = Protect. Shields you from SE moves and such to prevent a KO. Even more useful on Bisharp since it's fairly frail

Set Details
========
Life Orb is a great choice to increase Bisharp's already great power and make it even more threatening
EVs let Bisharp have as much power as possible while still having a decent Speed, since the bulk isn't too important.
Adamant is for a better damage output since you don't need the speed provided by Jolly
Defiant lets you get a free boost off of stat droppers like Intimidate and Icy Wind, making Bisharp very threatening to Pokemon w/ those type of things
Low Kick could be used over Iron Head to hit Heatran but other than that Iron Head is better.
Swords Dance can be used to make it much more threatening w/ +2 STAB priority and an inability to have its stat boosts stripped by Intimidate
These moves are generally the standard on bisharp though, and wavering from them can lower overall effectiveness

Usage Tips
========
is a nice trick room check since it hits most setters super effectively before they can use trick room
use sucker punch to pick off faster but frail threats
when you outspeed a Pokemon and you want to use a Dark-type attack, use Knock Off since Sucker Punch can be played around.
if you have other Pokemon who don't like having their attack dropped by Intimidate, use Bisharp to try and scare the opponent from bringing in their Intimidator
try to avoid letting this thing take much damage since its p. frail and that + lo recoil will add up
another reason to keep it alive is that it makes for a very good late-game cleaner
generally knock off is the go to attack for Bisharp. sucker punch is for things that can outspeed you, and iron head is for things that resist knock off, or if the opponent has no item but you dont want to/dont need to risk sucker punch failing. protect is just for when you need to shield bisharp from unwanted damage, since it isn't hard to KO

Team Options
========
strong physical attackers such as Tyranitar or Landorus-T will appreciate bisharp dealing w/ intimidate pokemon
psychics or fairies or ghosts such as follow me togekiss or cresselia can take fighting type hits for bisharp
slower pokemon such as Amoonguss or will appreciate Bisharp's ability to check faster threats w/ Sucker Punch
faster pokemon such as Terrakion will like Bisharp being able to KO most Trick Room setters
partners that can tank/redirect powerful hits for Bisharp like togekiss or amoonguss are cool to have
speed control from Pokemon such as Rotom-W or Cresselia or Togekiss is pretty useful, since Bisharp is even more threatening when it doesnt need to rely on sucker punch for faster threats.

Other Options
########
Due to the amount of switches it forces it can run Substitute. Also lets it dodge Will-O-Wisp
CB is nice to have a huge amount of power, but being locked into a move is a pain
Focus Sash is nice since Bisharp has many weaknesses and isnt too bulky
Lum Berry can be used to get rid of problematic burns, but other items are usually more useful
Psycho Cut to lure in and hit Fighting-types for SE damage
Taunt for slower mons that think they could hit it w/ status or still use support moves
Pursuit could be interesting to pick off a mon that thinks it can just switch out
Choice Scarf to surprise those expecting a slower set w/ a powerful hit before they move

Checks & Counters
########
fighting types like terrakion and conkeldurr will mess up bisharp
mach punch from breloom and conkeldurr especially are threatening since it will KO Bisharp before it can use an Iron Head
fire types such as charizard-y and heatran and volcarona will all mess up bisharp w/ stab heat wave. have trouble switchin in though
scarf ttar can outspeed and use low kick to KO
burns will make bisharp alot weaker, altho bisharp can actually threaten most burn users w/ a large chunk of damage
garchomp can outspeed, live through sucker punch, and ko w/ earthquake makin it a nice check
opposing bisharp w/ low kick, mega gyarados, and keldeo can all resist both of its stabs and hit it back for alot of damage
something w/ substitute is cool to be able to play around sucker punch as needed
