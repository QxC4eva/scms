Overview
########

With access to Gale Wings and STAB Brave Bird, Talonflame is unarguably the best revenge killer in OU. It can also be a great cleaner and sweeper, with Swords Dance, Bulk Up, or a Choice Band. Furthermore, Talonflame has priority Roost and a good typing that gives it plenty of opportunities to use it, allowing it to stick around throughout the match and check some common threats, such as Landorus and Mega Venusaur. However, Talonflame's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prevents it from switching in and out as much as it would want, and makes Defog or Rapid Spin support a necessity, hampering its effectiveness. Talonflame's weakness to Stealth Rock is amplified by the fact that both its STABs make it suffer recoil, further decreasing its longevity. Also, Talonflame's unimpressive base 81 Attack and lack of coverage means that it's easy to stop with physically bulky Pokemon or Pokemon that resists its STABs, such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon. Finally, Talonflame has weaknesses to the common Water-, Electric-, and Rock-type attacks, so taking it out is not hard at all.

Revenge Killer
########
name: Revenge Killer
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Flare Blitz
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Tailwind / Roost
ability: Gale Wings
item: Choice Band / Sharp Beak
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Brave Bird gets priority and is Talonflame's most useful asset, OHKOing many offensive Pokemon and also allowing Talonflame to clean up weakened teams. Flare Blitz takes care of the Steel-types that resists Brave Bird, as well as some Electric-types, such as Thundurus and Zapdos. U-turn does respectable damage to some of Talonflame's best switch-ins, such as Tyranitar and Rotom-W, and gives switch initiative. Tailwind is the best option for the last slot with Choice Band, as it gets priority and can let teams revenge kill Pokemon that Brave Bird alone can not, such as Mega Tyranitar, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Manectric. If Sharp Beak is the item of choice, then Roost is the superior option, allowing Talonflame to take advantage of its typing to find more switch-in opportunities and stick around for longer, by being able to heal damage taken from resisted attacks, such as Scizor's U-turn or Clefable's Moonblast.

There are some other situational moves that can be used on the last slot. Will-O-Wisp provides permanent chip damage to Talonflame's switch-ins and neuters its physically based checks, such as Tyranitar and Landorus-T, making them easier to wear down, but being locked into a status move has severe drawbacks, not to mention that often using U-turn as said check or counter comes in is the best move. Lastly, Me First allows Talonflame to OHKO Garchomp and Kyurem-B that have just KOed something with a Dragon-type attack.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed is used to speed tie opposing Talonflame and OHKO Mega Pinsir before it manages to hit Talonflame with +2 Quick Attack, and also lets Talonflame outspeed positive natured base 110s, such as Latios and Latias, so that you can OHKO them with U-turn if possible. Choice Band is the superior item choice as Talonflame will mostly be using either Brave Bird or U-turn, but Sharp Beak gives more flexibility and allows Talonflame to use Roost. A Jolly nature with an EV spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe can be used, enabling Talonflame to outspeed and OHKO Thundurus with Flare Blitz and giving it a bit more bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Talonflame is first and foremost a revenge killer, and should be played as such. The moment the battle starts, you should identify which Pokemon Talonflame can revenge kill; if those Pokemon are not too threatening to your team team, Talonflame can be played more recklessly. Otherwise, it should be kept safe at all costs, unless its use is absolutely necessary. In some situations, Talonflame can also end games with Brave Bird, so if one sees a team that can be swept by Talonflame with minimal preparations, it is wise to keep Talonflame healthy until those preparations have been made. Also, U-turn is the best move to spam early-game, as most of Talonflame's checks and counters can get worn down pretty easily by U-turn and Stealth Rock.

Team Options
========

A way to deal with Stealth Rock is the number one concern when using Talonflame. Excadrill, Latios, and Latias are the best Pokemon at this job, as all have decent synergy with Talonflame, resisting one or more of its weaknesses and beating some of its checks and counters (Mold Breaker Excadrill beats Rotom-W, Heatran, and Tyranitar; Latios and Latias beat Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Thundurus), so they are some of the best teammates to have. Next, a good check to Rotom-W and physical walls / pivots in general is needed, as those are the most common answers to Talonflame. Mega Venusaur and Kyurem-B can handle all of those, so they are both great partners. Rotom-W and Scizor have great synergy with Talonflame and can form a Volt-turn core that facilitates getting it for free. Stealth Rock support is nice to have, as it enables Talonflame to OHKO certain targets. For example, with Choice Band and Stealth Rock up, Brave Bird can OHKO Latias and Landorus, and 2HKO Mandibuzz and max HP Zapdos. Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Terrakion are all great partners and some of the best offensive Stealth Rock setters. Finally, Choice Band Staraptor and Mega Pinsir work great alongside Talonflame, as they all have similar checks and counters, allowing them to batter down such Pokemon in an attempt to overwhelm and possibly sweep.

Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Brave Bird
move 3: Roost
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Taunt
ability: Gale Wings
item: Leftovers
nature: Careful
evs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD

Moves
========

Bulk Up makes Talonflame really difficult to take down and gives it the power to sweep through teams. Brave Bird gets priority and hits hard after a few boosts, enabling Talonflame to bypass faster threats.
Roost allows Talonflame to accumulate multiple boosts in front of Pokemon that can't significantly hurt it and also gets priority, allowing Talonflame to soften the blow from faster Pokemon that use Rock or Electric moves if the need arises. Will-O-Wisp pressures Talonflame's checks and counters by slowly wearing them down, while also limiting the offensive presence of some of those Pokemon, such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T. Taunt prevents the use of phazing moves, entry hazards, and status, granting Talonflame the ability to beat some of its most common checks, namely Hippowdon and Heatran.

Substitute helps Talonflame stall out the PP of Stone Edge users, such as Tyranitar and Landorus-T, and Rotom-W's Hydro Pump, allowing Talonflame to use them as set up bait, sometimes. Flare Blitz can be used for the last slot for a way to deal immediately with threatening Steel-types, such as Aegislash and Excadrill, and Thundurus, but leaves Talonflame very prone to its usual checks and counters, unlike the other options on the last slot.

Set Details
========

Special bulk is maximized to help Talonflame take hits on its weaker side, as Bulk Up patches up its physical side. If using Taunt, a spread of 248 HP / 184 SpD / 76 Spe with a Careful nature can be used, letting Talonflame outrun Timid Deoxys-D and Taunt it before it can use Thunder Wave or set up entry hazards.

Usage Tips
========

If the opponent lacks Fire-types, send Talonflame in as early as possible when the game starts to cripple its checks with Will-O-Wisp, making them easier to wear down throughout the course of the game. With Taunt, this set stops many of the universal Talonflame checks, such as Whirlwind Hippowdon and specially defensive Heatran, so use this to your advantage; send out Talonflame when it can threaten everything on the opposing team other than said mons, and as they come in, either grab a second Bulk Up boost as they switch out (realizing they sent in the wrong Pokemon), or Taunt them and then grab a second Bulk Up boost. Also, take advantage of Talonflame's fast Taunt to handicap Pokemon that rely a lot on non-attacking moves, such as Deoxys-D, Defog Mandibuzz, and Hippowdon. Be aware what attacks Talonflame can and can't take in both sides, so you can decide whether you should stay in and boost more or switch out.

Team Options
========

Anti-Stealth Rock support is a must, even more so than on other sets, as Bulk Up Talonflame likes to switch in and out a lot to take advantage of defensive investment coupled with its nice typing and Roost to check multiple Pokemon, ability to cripple its checks with Will-O-Wisp, and lack of immediate power which makes straight up walling it easier. Defog Mega Scizor and Skarmory are the most sturdy Pokemon for this job, though more offensive choices such as Latios, Latias, and Excadrill can work depending on the team. All of those Pokemon have at least decent defensive synergy with Talonflame, being able to check or wall some of the Pokemon that Talonflame struggles against, such as Rotom-W, Heatran, Tyranitar, Thundurus, and Landorus-T. Mega Venusaur can check most Water and Electric-types that threaten Talonflame, in addition to handling certain physically defensive Pokemon that wall Talonflame, such as Hippowdon and Tyranitar. Choice Band Staraptor can wear down Talonflame's checks and counters so that it has an easier time sweeping late-game, making for a great partner; the same goes for Mega Pinsir.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Brave Bird
move 3: Flare Blitz
move 4: Roost
ability: Gale Wings
item: Sharp Beak / Life Orb
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

Moves
========

With Swords Dance and priority Brave Bird, Talonflame can take the role of a sweeper. Brave Bird is fairly powerful after a boost and OHKOes most offensive Pokemon. Flare Blitz takes care of Steel-types, while Roost gives some use to Talonflame in the early and mid-game, as it can throw a couple of attacks, recover off the passive damage and recoil, and set up later to attempt a sweep. Roost also makes Talonflame able to deal with the Pokemon it checks for an extended period of time, such as Scizor, Clefable, Mega Venusaur, and Volcarona.

U-turn can be used on the last slot, as Talonflame fits nicely onto Volt-Turn chains, and can wear down certain of its checks and counters, such as Rotom-W and Tyranitar. Taunt shuts down Hippowdon and defensive Heatran, allowing Talonflame to boost enough to get past them and sweep.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed is used to speed tie opposing Talonflame and OHKO Mega Pinsir with Brave Bird before it manages to land a Quick Attack. Sharp Beak is the best item option to power up Brave Bird, as after a boost, Flare Blitz has enough power to KO its targets, and with Life Orb Talonflame will get KOed by recoil really fast. However, Life Orb is useful to get some crucial OHKOes with Brave Bird, namely a 43.8% chance to OHKO Thundurus, a 25% chance to OHKO Choice Scarf Excadrill or Sand Rush Excadrill in sand after Stealth Rock, a 50% chance to OHKO Choice Scarf Rotom-W after Stealth Rock, and a 75% chance to OHKO specially defensive Hippowdon after one layer of Spikes. Life Orb also gives to Talonflame more immediate power, which is useful for revenge killing purposes. A Jolly nature with an EV spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe can be used if Thundurus is particularly problematic, as it lets Talonflame outspeed and OHKO it with Flare Blitz.

Usage Tips
========

This set can be very flexible in terms of playstyle. It can take the role of an all-out attacker, revenge killer, pivot, hole puncher, and late-game cleaner; choose what it is more appropriate for after seeing your opponent's team. As long as there are hard counters to Talonflame, it's better to double switch out or heal with Roost. Also, if you want to clean up with Talonflame, make sure you have enough health to do so, as many teams rely on recoil damage to check Talonflame if their checks and counters are weakened.

Team Options
========

As usual, Excadrill, Latios, and Latias are the best partners to Talonflame, as they are effective at getting rid of Stealth Rock, have good offensive presence, and cover Talonflame's weaknesses. Strong physical wallbreakers to weaken down the physically bulky Pokemon that Talonflame can't OHKO, such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T, work well with Talonflame. Such Pokemon include Swords Dance Garchomp, Choice Band Terrakion, and Swords Dance Aegislash, with Garchomp also being able to set up Stealth Rock, further assisting Talonflame. Rotom-W can deal with most physical walls and tanks that check Talonflame, in addition to bringing Talonflame in unharmed with Volt Switch, making for a very effective teammate. Staraptor forms a very effective offensive core with Talonflame, as both Pokemon have similar checks and counters, so either of them can weaken the opposing team so that the other one can clean up later. If Staraptor holds Choice Band, Staraptor is usually the one who weakens the opposing team and Talonflame the one who sweeps, while if Staraptor holds Choice Scarf the opposite happens. Mega Pinsir wears down Talonflame's checks and counters in a similar fashion, so it's another good teammate for it.

Other Options
########

A set with Brave Bird, Roost, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp can be used, which allows Talonflame to stallbreak, revenge kill, and cripple some of its counters all in one set; however, it excels in none of those roles and loses out on a lot of power, making revenge killing with Brave Bird much more difficult. Natural Gift with Salac or Liechi Berry can be used on the Swords Dance set; Salac Berry gives Talonflame a 100 BP Fighting move, which it can use to get past Tyranitar and Heatran, while Liechi Berry gives it a 100 BP Grass move, which it can use to get past Rotom-W and Tyranitar. Finally, a mixed set with max Special Attack, Fire Blast, and Hidden Power Ice or Ground can be used, allowing Talonflame to get past some of its usual checks and counters such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Heatran, and to avoid recoil when using its Fire STAB.

Checks & Counters
########

- **Physically Defensive Pokemon**: Some of the best ways to deal with Talonflame is through sheer physical bulk, as Talonflame is not very powerfull. Physically defensive Gyarados, Slowbro, Zygarde, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Gliscor, Mandibuzz, Vaporeon, and Krookodile all have excellent physical bulk and are neutral to Talonflame's STABs, and thus can wall it, while slowly wearing it down with its own recoil (and sandstorm in Hippowdon's case), and some of them can even OHKO it back, namely Rock Slide Hippowdon, Gyarados, and Landorus-T. Keep in mind that any of those Pokemon that can't immediately threaten Talonflame will lose to the Bulk Up set with Taunt, and some of them are heavily crippled by Will-O-Wisp, a common move on the Bulk Up set. Basically, any physical attacker or Pokemon that lack reliable recovery are very prone to getting worn down if Talonflame has Will-O-Wisp. Also, U-turn is another thing to keep in mind, as it can wear down many of those Pokemon, especially those weak to it or those that lack recovery, especially when combined with Stealth Rock damage.

- **Pokemon that resist Talonflame's STABs**: Almost every Pokemon that resists Talonflame's STABs and has passable physical bulk is at least a good check to it, with the exception of Thundurus, which can't switch into Talonflame at all but can revenge kill it, as it can take even one Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird after Stealth Rock damage and OHKO back. Such Pokemon are Tyranitar, Rotom-W, Heatran, Rotom-H, Zapdos, and Mega Aerodactyl, with Rotom-W and specially defensive Heatran straight up countering most of Talonflame's sets. However, Heatran loses to the Bulk up set with Taunt and might fail to beat the Swords Dance set too, but it can carry a Rock move to beat those sets. Also, while Zapdos doesn't resist Talonflame's Fire STAB, it can still avoid the 2HKO from it without Stealth Rock up as long as Talonflame isn't holding a Choice Band, thanks to its good bulk, so it makes for a good check as long as Stealth Rock is off the field. Out of all the Tyranitar sets, only the tank set can repeatedly switch into Talonflame, as all other variants are worn down very fast by U-turn, and if it lacks a Rock-type attack it loses to the Bulk Up set, while getting crippled heavily by Will-O-Wisp from Bulk Up sets. Keep in mind that even though Choice Band Tyranitar can't switch into Talonflame easily in fear of U-turn, it can easily Pursuit trap it after Talonflame KOes something with Brave Bird or Flare Blitz. In general, any Pokemon that is weak to U-turn or lacks reliable recovery might fail to deal with Talonflame after repeated U-turn hits, and any physical attacker is heavily crippled by Will-O-Wisp.

- **Passive Damage**: Stealth Rock is Talonflame's biggest enemy. As long as you manage to keep Stealth Rock on the field, you have managed to keep Talonflame in check. Additionally, because both of Talonflame's STABs induce recoil, forcing Talonflame to KO or weaken itself is another way to deal with it. The best way to this is with Rocky Helmet Garchomp, which between a high HP stat, Rough Skin, and Rocky Helmet, causes Talonflame to take tons of recoil. The fact that Garchomp has enough bulk to take a couple of hits from Talonflame helps too. Ferrothorn, especially with Rocky Helmet, is another Pokemon that can almost KO Talonflame through passive damage alone, though it must sacrifice itself to do so.
