Moves
========
- Shell Smash is a powerful boosting move that any sweeper would love to have. It's the focal point of the set boosting Attack, Special Attack and Speed by +2 while decreasing defenses by -1.
- Baton Pass is what makes this set so dangerous allowing it to pass the boosts off to a powerful sweeper.
- Hydro Pump is a powerful STAB move serving as a nuke with the Shell Smash boost even without investment.
- Surf is a 100% accurate STAB move at the cost of reduced power as opposed to Hydro Pump
- Ice Beam is a coverage option allowing it to hit Grass-types such as Chesnaught, and Celebi hard. Ice Beam also allows Gorebyss to smash Dragons such as Noivern, Garchomp, and Salamence to name a few.
- Substitute is a great move allowing Gorebyss and the receiver the ability to block harmful status although the nerf to Substitute makes this option less feasible.

Set Details
========
- Max Speed EVs allows Gorebyss to outspeed almost the whole unboosted metagame after a Shell Smash boost.
- Rest of the EVs are put into HP allowing Gorebyss to take most neutral hits and even some super-effective hits in an attempt to pass.
- White Herb allows Gorebyss to remove the stat drops from Shell Smash while Lum Berry removes crippling status such as paralysis which makes Gorebyss' job of passing a lot harder.

Usage Tips
========
- Gorebyss should come in on a wall that cannot threaten it such as Blissey although it should be wary of Thunder Wave if not using Lum Berry and proceed to Shell Smash. It should then pass the boosts to a sweeper.
- If nothing is able to stomach it's STAB move of choice or Ice Beam then Gorebyss should proceed to sweep.

Team Options
========
- Teammates who appreciate Shell Smash boosts should be partnered with Gorebyss; Mega-Garchomp, and Aegislash pair up well as they can sweep teams with +2 boosts. There are very few Pokemon in general that don't appreciate a +2 boost to all offensive stats.
- Partners such as Espeon are nice as they can block phazing attempts from Roar and Whirlwind while having access to Baton Pass themselves so they can continue to pass to the intended target.

Other Options
========
- There aren't many other options for Gorebyss. It can abuse the boosts itself with Life Orb in an attempt to sweep, but it's better off passing to a teammate who can more sufficiently abuse the boosts. Gorebyss should shift HP EVs into Special Attack if they decide to take this route.

Checks and Counters
========
**Phazing**: Phazing effectively ruins Gorebyss' ability to pass as the receiver will just be phazed out as it acquires the boost. Team that pack a phazer must watch out for Magic Bouncers such as Xatu, Espeon, or Mega-Absol, and Dragon Tail users must beware if Gorebyss sets up a Sub as it most likely will not break it.

**Hard hitting Scarfers**: Choice Scarfed Pokemon that can hit hard such as Choice Scarf Latios can KO Gorebyss with Stealth Rock. Even if Gorebyss acquires a Shell Smash boost, it still will not be able to outspeed Scarf Latios.

**Haze**: Haze removes all stat boosts which stops Gorebyss from doing much of anything other than passing a potential sub.

**Taunt**: Taunt shuts down Gorebyss from doing much of anything aside from switching and spamming Hydro Pump.
