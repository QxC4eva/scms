Faints the user, but heals the replacement.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user faints. The Pokemon switched in next has its HP restored to its maximum and any status conditions removed. The Pokemon enters the field at the end of the turn Healing Wish is used, so the Pokemon switched in does not take an attack. The Pokemon switched in will be healed to maximum before it takes any entry hazard damage. Fails if the user is the last non-fainted Pokemon in its party.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Healing Wish is uncommon, but useful. If the Pokemon that is central to the strategy of your team is crippled, Healing Wish can safely heal and switch it in. Thus, this move is effective on fast Pokemon, sacrificing themselves at the last minute. This can quickly turn the tables on your opponent.</p>
