<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>So in order to celebrate LA getting knocked out of the wcop, I decided to make an rmt. This team is I guess more oriented for stalling and is probably the easiest to use team I've made in any generation of Pokemon. While using this team I've managed to reach #1 on the Smogon PO Ladder rather easily multiple times, 
the highest being a rating of ~1630 which I accomplished in my first trial with it last year for the 5th round of suspect testing. And I guess that's a true enough testament to how easy to use and effective it has been since it has been successful even in metagames dominated my Thundurus and Excadrill. </p>

<p>The team had remained untouched and a year later it still helped reach the top of the ladder as well as helping me to a mediocre 2-1 record in wcop and decent 7-3 in the frontier. Although a couple other users might just associate the team with "Schweinsteiger", an alt I used on the ladder, the teams roots can be traced back to a kind of mix to teams used by Mien and Ace Matador, and then given my golden Latias to top it off. It feels almost weird to even make an rmt in the first place considering my relative low contribution put into this site and my dislike for most rmts, but with BW2 being released and since I've been able to really alter this team into a successful mold for it,
I've decided to just leave it be and I guess brag about it since that's all rmts are good for anyway. </p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/248.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spd<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Pursuit</p>

<p>When I was making this team, I first was using miens which had beaten me countless times on the ladder. I quickly noticed that if I did not have something to change the weather to a more favorable option, I would be completely obliterated by Sun teams and even some Rain teams, which spammed mix Thundurus and Tornadus. The reason I decided to make it band was to immediately OHKO Reuniclus which had been a problem in the metagame at the time. But even as Reuniclus usage died down, Tyranitar proved to be more than worthy as it could get rid of annoying spin blockers such as Jellicent as well as trap and kill annoying Psyshock users such as Latios, Latias, and even some Starmies. It also gives me an upper hand on Rain Stall teams since a combination of 3 pursuits will KO opposing Tentacruel while 3 Scalds will not unless of course they get a burn.</p>

<p><strong>Blissey</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Softboiled<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Toxic</p>

<p>Blissey was one of the 3 core pokes along with Gliscor and Quagsire that I saw as must haves for a stall team. Obviously it helps tank Special Attackers and is the primary switch in to pokes like Politoed and Hydreigon who would otherwise slam the rest of my team. The reason I use SR on Blissey rather than
Tyranitar is because.. well its easier, Blissey can switch in on a lot and often forces the opponent to switch out which I can use to get up an easy SR. I also carry Toxic to trump unsuspecting opponents like Celebi and Latias who believe that when they see SR that they can auto set up on me with either Nasty Plot or Calm Mind respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Gliscor</strong> @ Toxic Orb<br />
Ability: Poison Heal<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 36 Def / 220 Spe<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Protect<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Fang<br />
- Swords Dance</p>

<p>Gliscor is a bat with pinchers. Its new ability in tandem with Toxic Orb is also cool. Protect works well with the many Toxic users on this team to efficiently stall out weakened opponents. I have the evs as they are in order to outspeed max speed Dragonite and Mamoswine I believe. Ice Fang and Swords Dance means I will always beat Sub DD Dragonite. Gliscor's unique typing also allows me to take hits from pokes like Terrakion and Conkeldurr who would otherwise prove quit problematic.</p>

<p><strong>Quagsire</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Unaware<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Scald<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>Quagsire is my favorite poke of this meta, all because of its ability which allows me to be lazy in predicting since this thing can always come in and stop anything that has set up. Evs are designed to take maximum amount of hits physically while the moveset is really self-explanatory. Scald for the burn on SD Scizor, and EQ to take on other threats like Heatran, Tyranitar, and Terrakion. Toxic allows me to stall out some opponents like Landorus incase I don't get the burn from Scald. Recover to recover health duh. </p>

<p><strong>Latias</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 12 HP / 252 SpA / 244 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>Probably the real bailout in the team. Latias can sweep sun teams, eliminate the Volturn combo of Scizor and Rotom-w fairly quickly if necessary and provides an extra switch into rain teams if I were to somehow lose Blissey. It also grants me some speed and late game sweeping if the match were to somehow get away from me earlier. Overall it's pretty self-explanatory, evs are added so that I can give myself as much power to get rid of scizor as well as enough to speed to beat Terrakion and Virizion.</p>

<p><strong>Forretress</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 24 Def / 232 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Volt Switch</p>

<p>The last Pokemon on the team and probably the most stall defining of them all. Forretress allows me to obviously spin and set up spikes. Toxic is more useful than toxic spikes since I can hit things like Latios which have Levitate and it doesn't get cancelled by a Tentacruel switch in like Toxic Spikes would, which would just make everything more annoying. Volt Switch works well since I can switch out of incoming Tentacruel and Jellicent and go to Tyranitar in order to finish them off.</p>
