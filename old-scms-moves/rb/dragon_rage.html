<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This move always deals 40 HP damage. Dragon Rage isn't affected by STAB, weakness, resistance, or any other factors.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The only Dragon-type move in RBY. One would expect greatness, but it's very, very lackluster. Unlike Seismic Toss and Night Shade, which can hit for up to 100 damage, Dragon Rage does a fixed 40 damage per use, therefore is not viable competitively.</p>
