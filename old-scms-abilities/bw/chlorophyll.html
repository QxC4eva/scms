<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If sun is the prevailing weather condition, the wielder's Speed stat is doubled. If the sun ends or a new weather condition is brought into play, the wielder's Speed returns to normal.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Chlorophyll is an extremely powerful tool for sun-based teams. Most Grass-type attackers may pack a punch, but they are usually terribly slow. Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/victreebel">Victreebel</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/tangrowth">Tangrowth</a> have trouble launching one of their ground-shattering attacks, due to being outsped and taken out. However, many Grass-type Pokemon with Chlorophyll still face the same problem in that their own weather condition makes their weakness to Fire-type attacks greater. Chlorophyll is an amazing ability in its own right, turning Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/sawsbuck">Sawsbuck</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/venusaur">Venusaur</a> into dangerous attackers. However, the fundamental problem still lies with using the weather condition as a core for a team.</p>
