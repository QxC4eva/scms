Prankster Utility
########
name: Prankster Utility
move 1: Will-O-Wisp
move 2: Recover
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Foul Play / Night Shade / Knock Off
ability: Prankster
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 88 Def / 168 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

- Will-O-Wisp is Sableye's main source of damage and defense. Use it often.
- Recover is for reliable healing, and with Prankster Sableye always heals first.
- Taunt is handy for shutting down set-up sweepers and defensive Pokemon.
- For the last slot, there are a lot of options. Foul Play punishes physical attackers, Mega Charizard-X in particular.
- Night Shade provides reliable damage, but you can't always break opposing Substitutes.
- Knock Off provides some utility, crippling basically any non-Mega Pokemon.

Set Details
========

- 252 HP and 88 Def with a Bold nature allows you to always survive a Return from a Mega Pinsir.
- The rest goes into Special Defense, since you already have burn to help you out with the physical side.
- Prankster is your best friend, making all your non-attacking moves go first.

Usage Tips
========

- Prankster allows a priority Will-O-Wisp. This is your offense and defense, so use it often.
- If something that can't hurt you is being annoying, like a Mandibuzz, use Taunt to shut it down.
- DON'T use taunt on something that can severely hurt you unless you want to sacrifice Sableye.
- You can use Recover to scout damage and sets on Pokemon, use this to your advantage.
- Watch out for Fire-types that can come in for free on a Will-O-Wisp, especially Heatran.

Team Options
========

- Sableye is a pretty independent Pokemon, but a partner to take powerful special hits is recommended. Tyranitar can get rid of threatening special cannons like Latios and Mega Charizard-Y, while Sableye can burn things like Landorus-T that annoy Tyranitar.
- As Sableye's main method of doing damage is burning stuff, you should have an answer to the common Fire-types in the tier. Something like Gyarados can take on Fire-types and hit back with Waterfall.
- Since Sableye's only weakness is Fairy, packing a nice Scizor or Heatran to take Fairy hits is not a bad idea.

Other Options
========

- Sableye has a plethora of other cool support moves to make use of with Prankster. These include Gravity, Confuse Ray, Swagger, Toxic, Embargo, Confide, Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Spite, Trick and Imprison are all moves he has access to. Some of these aren't great choices, but all are useful in certain situations.
- Sableye can run Metal Burst, but its general lack of bulk and lack of Sturdy make it a bad option.
- Sableye has a large physical movepool, consisting of Sucker Punch, Shadow Claw, and all the elemental punches, with Hone Claws as a boosting move. However, keep in mind that it's coming off of 75 base Attack.

Checks and Counters
========

- Heatran and Mega Charizard-Y can absorb the Will-O-Wisp and hit back with strong Fire Blasts.
- Faster Pranksters with Taunt, like Thundurus or Whimsicott, can completely shut him down.
- Any powerful special attacker that doesn't mind the burn too much usually does well, like Latios or Greninja.
- Toxic completely cripples him, although it has to be caught on the switch as Sableye can just Taunt otherwise.
- Sableye is vulnerable to all hazards, especially the rare Toxic Spikes.
