		<p>Hello, readers!</p>
		
		<p>This month has been pretty exciting - both on the sim and in the webzine. PSPL II has just finished recently, with Italiano being crowned the winners after weeks of intense battling. A well-deserved grats to them. The webzine has also had a lick of paint from <a href="/forums/members/quarkz.206020/">Quarkz</a>, who's been updating the layout so that it's exceptionally easy on the eye.</p>
		
		<p>This issue's gone through a lot pre-release, but the end product is marvellous! A special thanks to <a href="/forums/members/miniarchitect.230136/">MiniArchitect</a> for doing a fantastic job with the Spiritomb for this issue's cover art. I hope you enjoy reading this issue as much as we enjoyed creating it.</p>
		
		<p>Happy Halloween!</p>

		<p>Issue 4 has some fantastic reads, such as the <a href="sky-battles-102">Sky Battles 102</a>, <a href="interview-with-briyella">Interview with Goddess Briyella</a>, and Spydreigon's look at <a href="staff-communication">how staff communicate</a>. Thanks to <a href="/forums/members/shaymin.178207/">shaymin</a>, <a href="/forums/members/quarkz.206020/">Quarkz</a>, and <a href="/forums/members/offler.208105/">offler</a> for their help during release, and I hope you all have a pleasant read!</p>
