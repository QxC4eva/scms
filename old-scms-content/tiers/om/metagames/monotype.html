<h2>What is Monotype?</h2>

<p>Monotype is a really simple concept; you build a team of six Pokemon sharing one common type and fight against teams with the same restriction. You are allowed to use Pokemon with dual-typing on a team represented by either type, but every other Pokemon must share the same type. For example, you can use Scrafty, a Fighting/Dark-type Pokemon, on a Mono-Fighting or a Mono-Dark team. If you choose Scrafty, you can also use Cacturne, a Grass/Dark-type Pokemon, and create a Mono-Dark team with the two of them, but you cannot use Venusaur, a Grass/Poison-type Pokemon, because it shares no common typing with Scrafty. Finally, with our new Mega Evolutons of XY, you'll find some of them change their typing upon Mega Evolving. When using a Mega Evo that changes its typing, you must base its spot on your team on its regular form's typing. What this means is that you can use Mega Charizard X on a Mono-Flying team, but you may not use it on a Mono-Dragon team. Similarly, Mega Aggron can be used on either Mono-Steel or Mono-Rock teams despite losing its Rock typing upon Mega Evolving.</p>

<h4>Threat List</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/658.png" alt="" /><strong>Greninja (Water + Dark):</strong> Greninja resides on 2 of the most potential types out there, Water and Dark. However, Greninja's job is similar on both types, get rid of your type's general checks with its wide movepool before sweeping with its blazing speed. Depending on the team, you will find many variations, Physical, Special, and even Scarf. All dangerous, and capable of sweeping unprepared teams.</p>


<p><img src="http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/113.png" alt="" /><strong>Chansey (Normal):</strong> Normal is considered to be one of the bulkiest types, and many teams find themselves unable to beat its defensive core. Chansey is the most notable due to its ability to support its teammates with Wish, Heal Bell, and Stealth Rock. An Eviolite further boosts its defenses making a Chansey check almost mandatory in every team.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/308-m.png" alt="" /><strong>Mega Medicham (Fighting + Psychic):</strong> Base 100 speed may seem lacking, but its Pure Power isn't. With the ability to 1-2KO every single wall in Monotype it makes a terrifying wallbreaker, letting its teammates sweep with ease once it does its job. High Jump Kick is mandatory, since it nukes everything it touches. Psycho Cut breaks Poison types such as Mega Venusaur and Weezing who resist HJK. Fake Out lets it mega evolve safely while doing a good amount of chip damage. The last moveslot is either Bullet Punch or Ice Punch since it lets it get past its usual checks such as Mega Gardevoir and Landorus-T respectively.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/006-mx.png" alt="" /><strong>Mega Charizard-X (Fire + Flying):</strong> Although it has fallen from its throne since the beginning of ORAS, Charizard-X is still a threat to look out for. Its great typing grants it immunity from Will-o-Wisp letting it set up on things such as Sableye and weak Scald users. In addition to that, Dragon and Fire STAB is amazing in this meta, letting it hit almost everything neutrally, which is further boosted by Tough Claws. Earthquake lets you demolish Heatran, while Roost provides longitivtiy. If you forgo Dragon Dance, you can run a Bulky Will-o-Wisp set that neutralizes its usual counters while checking its type's threats.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/036.png" alt="" /><strong>Clefable (Fairy):</strong> Also known as Cancerfable to many, it has a good reason to be called that. Teams will find themselves being swept by its Calm Mind set, or being slowly stalled to death by its Cosmic Power boosts. It has 2 great defensive abilities to choose from, them being Unaware of Magic Guard. Luckily, it's only found in Fairy Monotypes who have become rarer due to departure of Mega Mawile. However, be sure to pack at least one check to this unless you want to be swept.</p>
