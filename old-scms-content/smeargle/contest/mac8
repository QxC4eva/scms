Monthly Art Contest #8: Contrast
[head]

[page]

<p>With Bucky's departure, it was a sad day for MAC fans: the whole shebang was her brainchild, and she would be dearly missed. Nevertheless, it was time for an exciting new theme: 'Contrast'! The artists fervently attacked the competition (that is, the challenge, not the other entrants) and in the end produced some amazing pieces of work. aragornbird was late [again], but he did not disappoint.</p>
