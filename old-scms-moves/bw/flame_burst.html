<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. In doubles and triples it deals typeless damage to the opponents next to the target equal to 1/16th of their maximum HP rounded down. This does not trigger abilities that are triggered by Fire-type attacks. The non-targeting damage is not blocked by Protect, Wide Guard, Detect, Endure, or the ability Wonder Guard. The non-targeting damage is blocked by the ability Magic Guard. The non-targeting damage is not associated with the user, so the user is not affected if an opponent that is KOed by the secondary damage uses Destiny Bond.</p>

<h2>Competitive Uses</h2>
<p>Flame Burst is outclassed in singles by Flamethrower. In doubles and triples it is useful for its ability to hit multiple targets.</p>
