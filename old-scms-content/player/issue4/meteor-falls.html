<p><em>Scene notes: Meteor Falls has just been renamed to 'ORAS'. It's the same room, just rebranded and with an added focus on Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.</em></p>

<p>With the release of Pok&eacute;mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire looming just around the corner, most people have taken to proclaiming in the Lobby or other big rooms every time a piece of new information about the game is announced, leaving a flood of overly repeated information among the room, which is never a pleasant sight. Now surely there isn't a room on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! dedicated solely to the Pok&eacute;mon games, both new and old, is there? Wait, there is! A humble little room, providing the masses with all of the current information on the new games coming to us, going by the name of Meteor Falls.</p>

<p>Now I'm certain that people are asking, "Why Meteor Falls? How does that let us know what this room is about?" While I can agree with that, at first glance, the room doesn't seem to have any connection to the happening of the new games, if you look a little closer, you can see the nostalgic background of the name behind the room. For those who adore Gen 3 as much as I do, you should know that Meteor Falls was the location of a main quest in the plot that you had to go through in Pok&eacute;mon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald. Nifty little feature of the room, isn't it? But now that we know why the room is called what it is, let us delve into the functions of the room. Way back when, before the release of Pok&eacute;mon X and Y, the room was named (conveniently enough) Pok&eacute;mon X/Y and served as the congregation of those who were interested in chatting about the newly implemented features and Pok&eacute;mon that were released in trailers, magazines, and other official sources. As its predecessor before, you can expect Meteor Falls to be doing the same, but with a more subtle name. Be it that you want to know what new Mega Pok&eacute;mon have been announced, or what exactly these "Primal Pok&eacute;mon" you've been hearing about are.</p>

<p>However, don't think that Meteor Falls is just limited to information about the release of the new games. The userbase loves discussing all types of Pok&eacute;mon games, be it Gen 1 or Gen 5. As long as it's about a Pok&eacute;mon game (and on occasion Digimon, I kid) the room will gladly embrace it as a topic. Meteor Falls is filled with a friendly userbase of Pok&eacute;mon enthusiasts who will try their best to help integrate you into the room, and make your experience a great time! Another fun topic that happens in the room is ROM hacks, leaving endless possibilities for discussion to ensue. For those of you who are wondering what a ROM hack is, the most basic way of putting it is as such: a modified version of an original game with intent to change various aspects of it, such as dialogue, graphics, images, or even the whole point of the game itself. The main intent behind such ROM hacks is to keep the magical fun of playing Pok&eacute;mon going on after the fun of the main series games has begun to dwindle. To keep up such fun playstyles, Meteor Falls also allows for talk of various in-game challenges, including discussion or Nuzlockes or another other form of -locke. In short, Meteor Falls is open to discussion about any form of Pok&eacute;mon games, whether it's main-series, a spin-off, or an entirely different adaptation of a game!</p>

<p>Now surely a room with such a refined view about the Pok&eacute;mon game franchise would be an elitist club, would it not? That's the absolute opposite of what this room is. It's a place of caring, one that you can jump into at any time to spark up a discussion. The userbase is amazing, welcoming, and knows exactly how to make you feel at home. But let us not forget the true masterminds of such a room: the room staff. They work ever so hard to keep you up-to-date on all of the new releases, as well as keeping the room as a place of joy, free of worry that the room will one day succumb to the forces of trolls and spammers. It's an arduous task, so be sure to thank the staff when you see them, as they work their hardest to make sure that Meteor Falls is a room you would want to be in.</p>

<p>Well, now that you know all about this once-mysterious room, be sure to stop by and give it a try, whether you want more information on the upcoming games or just a place to hang.</p>
