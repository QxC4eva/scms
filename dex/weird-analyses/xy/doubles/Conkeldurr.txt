Overview
########
- Very strong and works well both in and out of trick room.
- Good bulk on both sides with a powerful recovery move making it a good Assault Vest user.
- Stays alive for a while thanks to recovery from its main STAB move Drain Punch.
- STAB Mach Punch mitigates poor speed.
- Two good abilities: Iron Fist boosts the power of a lot of Conkeldurr's moves, and Guts which is excellent at beating teams that rely on Will-o-Wisp to do check strong physical attackers.
- Wide offensive movepool offering a degree of versatility.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Drain Punch
move 2: Mach Punch
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Ice Punch
ability: Iron Fist / Guts
item: Assault Vest
evs: 108 HP / 152 Atk / 104 Def / 144 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Drain Punch is the primary STAB, though weak it recovers Conkeldurr's HP keeping it healthy.
- Mach Punch is useful for revenge killing low health Pokemon.
- Knock Off provides solid coverage against Ghost and Psychic types, and gets rid of the opponent'ss item which is useful.
- Ice Punch offers excellent coverage hitting Landorus-T and other defensive Fighting-type resistances for good damage.

Set Details
========
- Assault Vest boosts Conkeldurr's Special Defense to high levels letting it take special hits all day while recovering health with Drain Punch 
- The EVs allow Conkeldurr to live Life Orb Latios' Psyshock and two Timid Mega Charizard Y Heat Waves in the sun, the rest is put in Attack for power
- An Adamant nature is used to confer the most stat points overall and increase power.
- If Conkeldurr is being used on a Trick Room based team use 0 speed IVs and Brave nature 
- Iron Fist boosts the power of all its attacks except Knock Off which is useful 
- Guts is useful as it allows Conkeldurr to laugh at status, turning would be checks such as Rotom-W into easy prey.

Usage Tips
========
- Conkeldurr works well both in and out of Trick Room, though unsurprisingly it is better in one.
- Conkeldurr's defenses are nothing short of impressive, it can easily take hits and do loads of damage back to powerful attackers. This makes it a check to nearly anything.
- Use Mach Punch to finish off low health Pokemon even in Trick Room, if the threat of priority is present
- A general rule of thumb is if the opponent has no Fighting-type resistances left then it is advisable to spam Drain Punch to prevent Conkeldurr from being worn down. If they do have one, spamming Knock Off is ideal to get rid of that Pokemon's item and deal huge damage.

Team Options
========
- Trick Room users such as Cresselia, Chandelure, Jellicent, and Dusclops are good partners to set up the Trick Room for Conkeldurr. They also appreciate Conkeldurr removing dark types like Tyranitar and Bisharp
- Cresselia in particular can provide useful Helping Hand support for Conkeldurr, set up reflect to soften physical attacks, and use Psyshock to deal with some of Conkeldurr's 
- Intimidate users such as Salamence, Gyarados, Landorus-T, and Mawile complement Conkeldurr's Assault Vest, effectively giving it +1 on either defensive stat
- Steel-types can take Psychic and Flying types moves aimed at Conkeldurr. Follow Me Jirachi in particular is good at this, as it can redirect them completely and absorb the hit with ease. Heatran is another good steel type partner as it completely counters Talonflame, a a big pain for Conkeldurr

Trick Room Attacker
########
name: Trick Room Attacker
move 1: Hammer Arm / Drain Punch
move 2: Mach Punch
move 3: Ice Punch / Knock Off
move 4: Protect
ability: Iron Fist / Guts
item: Life Orb
evs: 96 HP / 252 Atk / 80 Def / 80 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Brave

Moves
========
- Hammer Arm is Conkeldurr's strongest STAB, boosted with Iron Fist it has an effective 120 power. It also lowers Conkeldurr's Speed allowing it to underspeed nearly anything and thus always move first in a Trick Room
- Drain Punch is an option to use instead of Hammer Arm that is 25% weaker, however its ability to heal will keel Conkeldurr in the fight longer.
- Mach Punch is useful for picking off weakened targets, dealing with opposing priority in the Trick Room, and the ability to move before faster opponents outside it.
- Protect can shield Conkeldurr from attacks for a turn so its partner can deal with a problematic opponent, or set up Trick Room. Protect is of course also invaluable for scouting and stalling out Field Coniditions
- Ice Punch offers good coverage against bulky Ground and Flying types such as Landorus-T
- Knock Off lets Conkeldurr muscle past Psychic and Ghost types as well as offering the utility of item removal.
- Finally, Poison Jab is an option over Ice Punch and Knock Off to deal huge damage to Fairy-types that otherwise counter it 

Set Details
========
- Life Orb is ideal as in a Trick Room more power and less bulk are needed
- The evs maximize power while also guaranteeing Conkeldurr survives max Attack Metagross' Zen Headbutt after taking life orb damage, and the rest is put into Special Defense
- A Brave nature decreases Conkeldurr's Speed so that it moves before the opponent most often while also improving damage output
- Iron Fist boosts the power of all its attacks except Knock Off, dealing more damage flat out 
- Guts confers no immediate power boost however it makes Conkeldurr harder to deal with and can potentially give a ton of extra power

Usage Tips
========
- As this is a Trick Room set it is only to be used there.
- Hammer Arm with a boost is incredibly strong and should be used liberally. 
- Under the threat of priority, it is a good idea to finish off weakened opponents with Mach Punch

Team Options
========
- Trick Room users such as Cresselia, Chandelure, Jellicent, and Dusclops are good partners to set up the Trick Room for Conkeldurr. They also appreciate Conkeldurr removing dark types like Tyranitar and Bisharp
- Cresselia in particular can provide useful Helping Hand support for Conkeldurr, set up reflect to soften physical attacks, and use Psyshock to deal with some of Conkeldurr's 
- Intimidate users such as Scrafty and Mawile complement Conkeldurr's Assault Vest, effectively giving it +1 on either defensive stat
- Steel-types can take Psychic and Flying types moves aimed at Conkeldurr. Follow Me Jirachi in particular is good at this, as it can redirect them completely and absorb the hit with ease. Heatran is another good steel type partner as it completely counters Talonflame, a a big pain for Conkeldurr

Other Options
########

- Rock Slide and Earthquake are good spread moves, and also provide good coverage against a number of threats such as mega Pinsir, Charizard, and Aegislash
- Stone Edge is also viable to hit choice targets such as Charizard and Talonflame, and is not subject to Wide Guard
- Poison Jab is an option to hit Fairy-types however due to Conkeldurr's low speed it is only recommended to bring these moves if you have Trick Room support
- Toxic Orb in tandem with Guts boosts Conkeldurr's Attack to insane levels and lets it act as status absorber, but the residual damage from the status is often too great for it to be worth it.
- Thunder Punch provides additional coverage, hitting some lesser targets such as Gyarados but not much else 
- Choice Band is incredibly powerful, it OHKOs Lando-T with Ice Punch at -1 Attack, however the freedom to switch moves is too valuable for Conkeldurr to forfeit
- Focus Punch in tandem with Follow Me support can work, and is very strong but lacks reliability and autonomy

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: 

Most fairies take little damage from Conkeldurr's main attacks, and only have to watch out for Poison Jab. Some are weak to typical coverage move such as Togekiss.

**Offensive Flying and Psychic Types**: 

Conkeldurr is very slow, anything mildly fast as sufficiently strong such as mega Pinsir or mega Medicham will outspeed and OHKO Conkeldurr

**Burns**: 

Conkeldurr that lack Guts will have pathetic damage output, and be easy to wear down if burned. 

**Talonflame**: 

Unlike other offensive Flying-types Talonflame completely ignores Trick RoA

**Amoonguss and Togekiss**: 

These two shut down Conkeldurr with Rage Powder or Follow me, essentially forcing it to spam Ice Punch

**Intimidate**: 

Like nearly ever other physical attacker Conkeldurr is checked by Intimidate users, effortlessly cutting its power to 2/3 on switch in
