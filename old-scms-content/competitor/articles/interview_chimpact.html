<div id="interview">
  <div class="aside">Of all the places, did he really have to pick Babies "R" Us? Well, too late to complain; there he is.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" />What's chimpin', chimpact? Thanks for agreeing to do this!
  </div>

  <div class="speaker chimpact"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_chimpact.png" alt="" />ABSOLutely. I lose nothing by doing this interview.
  </div>

  <div class="aside">I couldnâ€™t stop laughing. Did not see that coming. Did not.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" />Haha. Well, first off, congratulations on winning the Little Cup Open! Did you ever expect yourself to come this far?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker chimpact"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_chimpact.png" alt="" />Not really, I've only played Little Cup a few times in my life.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" />Ah, I see. How did you prepare for each round of the Open?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker chimpact"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_chimpact.png" alt="" />I had help from Artemisa and Kratosmana. They were very helpful in helping me build teams for the rounds. I looked at my opponents replays and planned accordingly. Many of my opponents just used lil bish and Timburr.
  </div>

  <div class="aside">Counter-styling seems to be a trend in these tours.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" />So, with their help, you tried your best to counter-style/team your opponent for the rounds to come?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker chimpact"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_chimpact.png" alt="" />Yea, I just used stall mainly. "stall"
  </div>

  <div class="aside">These Pok&eacute;mon are level 5, barely out of the egg. How can they stall? This interested me.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" />Can you elaborate on the "stall" you used?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker chimpact"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_chimpact.png" alt="" />I used toxic spikes with Wish + Protect Spritzee and Fake Out Mienfoo if their team was weak to Toxic Spikes. I had Pumpkaboo to spinblock. Taunt Onix helped me with Defoggers.
  </div>

  <div class="aside">Seems like a well built team.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" />Ah, that sounds pretty solid, especially considering how well you did. Are there any particular sets or teams that performed extraordinarily well for you during the tour?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker chimpact"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_chimpact.png" alt="" />Yea, the stall team did really well. I was also really happy with the teams that featured Ponyta or Larvesta.
  </div>

  <div class="aside">A month ago he would have said he hated Little Cup. Did that change?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" />Really happy, you say? A little Pidgey told me that you were not a fan of Little Cup. Has that changed since entering the LC Open?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker chimpact"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_chimpact.png" alt="" />Well, considering I did well in the Open, I feel as if there's some sort of bias. You always feel good whenever you win games rather than lose. I'm not a fan of the speed ties and the damage rolls, but it was fun counter-teaming people.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" />I can see where you are coming from. Once again, congratulations on winning! You are currently number one in standings with 22 points, guaranteeing you a spot in play offs. How well do you expect to perform?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker chimpact"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_chimpact.png" alt="" />Well, I feel I got pretty lucky getting paired up against a few inexperienced opponents in a lot of my Open games. I'd be happy to win a few games though.
  </div>

  <div class="aside">A very mature answer. He's got the makings of a real champ. A Chimchamp!
  </div>

  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" />Humble I see. Even with luck, it is still very impressive to see that you have won. Do you have anything else to add before I go?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker chimpact"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_chimpact.png" alt="" />Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pokeaimMD">youtube.com/pokeaimmd</a>, big fan.
  </div>

  <div class="aside">I smirked at his last comment. Finally, I can get out of here!
