<p>We are almost through October, and what a hectic month it's  been. People have of course been glued to their DS, enjoying the in-game  quest of the fifth generation. If they weren't, they would of course be  browsing our forums. We actually had over 2000 users online, peaking at  2,169 on September 19th. It was, in fact, so bad that Cathy had to take  down several forum features just to counteract the enormous amount of  lag we were having. To celebrate the release of Pokémon: Black and White  and everything that came with it, our writers have worked hard to pack  this issue full of fifth gen material.</p>

<p>Speaking of Cathy, as you have no doubt noticed, <a href="showthread.php?t=79808">PokéLab</a>, which Cathy and her dev team have worked on for a long, long time, has finally been brought to public beta. However, since she has decided to depart from Smogon, we are no longer officially affiliated with this product. It's a shame to  see Cathy (and several other longtime contributors) go, and there's not  much to say besides a large "thank you" for all they contributed. In  the meantime, if you wish to check on the program, you are welcome to  check Cathy's website.</p>

<p>Staying on the subject of female users, a hearty  congratulations to <a href="member.php?u=9179">*Hen*</a> on  getting married! Hen has been part of the WiFi community for a while  now, but she's also known for her <a href="showthread.php?t=34400">Digital Art</a> thread and her  artistic contributions to The Smog. But even if she wasn't, she's still  definitely worth congratulating!</p>

<p>With happy news comes sad news: <a href="member.php?u=14464">ToF</a>, perhaps known by some as  Twist of Fate, has decided he needs more time to dedicate to his real  life affairs. Therefore, we likely won't be seeing any of his Smog  articles or team rates in the near future. Good luck with everything,  ToF!</p>

<p>So what do we have in store for you this issue? Chou Toshio has  made it easier for you to play that Japanese Black or White copy you  imported by providing some lessons in Japanese for beginners, as well as  a guide on good choices for your in-game team. Deck Knight shows you  the hits and misses of his predictions about the mechanics changes of  the fifth gen, and jumpluff presents the magic tricks of Pokémon  obtained in the brand new Dream World. This is especially interesting  for the many users who have tried out Pokémon Online's functional  Black/White battling simulation, where all Dream World abilities dumped  from the game are allowed!</p>

<p>Not exciting enough for you? Look at the calendar again. Is  there anything else happening around this time of the year? Indeed, it's  time for the Smog Awards nominations! Whether you think of it as a nice  way to reward members of the community for their efforts, or as a  popularity contest, the Smog Awards results are always heavily  anticipated. If you're eligible to nominate, make sure you do so  post-haste!</p>

<p>For those of you not into all the hype about new games and  awards, don't worry. We have featured RMTs, Trivia, an interview with  Synre, the heavily anticipated return of the Tournament Coverage, plus a  whole lot more in store for you.</p>

<p>I hope you all have fun reading and playing!</p>

<p>&mdash;Mekkah</p>

<p>P.S. Thank you <em>so</em> much, everybody who,  under short notice, contributed art to The Smog. We solicited art from  the public this time, and I personally was very impressed by the  submissions, which were kindly delivered by Fatecrashers. Don't fret if  you don't see yours in this issue; thankfully, supply exceeded demand,  and we did not anticipate the influx of fantastic works we received. As  such, we've decided to save a lot of it for the next issue, which will  be 5th gen-centric, and you will be appropriately credited. We really  appreciate it, and thanks for your patience. One last artistic thing to  note is that the cover art is a first for The Smog, as it features a CAP  Pokémon (specifically, CAP 11, Voodoom). And sorry for hijacking your  note, Mekkah! &mdash;jumpluff</p>
