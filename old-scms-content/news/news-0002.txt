CAP 19 is Underway
Jul 23, 2014
<p>The nineteenth process of the Create-A-Pokemon Project has just begun! Come help us <strong>build an entirely new Pokemon</strong> that will be featured on <strong>Pokemon Showdown</strong>. Led by veteran DarkSlay, this project is already gearing up to be one of our best yet. CAP is a community-driven project, so anyone with an account is allowed to submit concepts, discuss new ideas, and vote freely. Now is the perfect time to sign in and join up! Check out our forum <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/forums/create-a-pok%C3%A9mon-project.66/">here</a> to get started. ~ Birkal</p>
