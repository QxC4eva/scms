<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Hustle is a great ability, but its side effect is a total bummer. Hustle gives the user an Attack boost to all of the Pokemon's physical attacking moves at the cost of an accuracy drop. This Attack boost is what turns <a href="/bw/pokemon/durant">Durant</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/zweilous">Zweilous</a> into absolute monsters. However, the accuracy drop can easily lead to an untimely miss and cost the user the battle, especially if the attack already has low accuracy, such as <a href="/bw/moves/stone_edge">Stone Edge</a>. For this reason, <a href="/bw/moves/hone_claws">Hone Claws</a>, if available, is usually used in conjunction with the ability Hustle. Overall, this ability will usually be the main choice of any Pokemon that gets it unless the Pokemon also gets an equally great Special Attack stat and/or boosting moves, such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/togekiss">Togekiss</a>.</p>
