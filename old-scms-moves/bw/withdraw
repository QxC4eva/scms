<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Defense by 1 stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Withdraw should never be considered on any competitive team. First of all, boosting defenses is a subpar strategy since the opponent can simply bring out a sweeper to boost alongside or attack with the other offensive stat. Second of all, there are moves that boost the target's Defense by two stages, meaning using those moves is much more efficient.</p>
