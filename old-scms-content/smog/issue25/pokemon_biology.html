        <p>We live in an enlightened age of knowledge and solutions. Many pioneers in various subjects have paved the road for scientific discoveries and have allowed for new ways to think, act, and research to the point that we take things for granted. Once we receive an answer, we stop looking at the question. Facts are seen as such, with no questioning of the raw material used to reach that consensus. As Pokemon Biologists, we strive to go further than that, to challenge familiar hypotheses, to reach new explanations and the issues that arise with them, and to keep examining what's otherwise deemed as common knowledge. In an earlier issue, we discussed the various examples of <a href="/smog/issue23/pokemon_biology">Combined Evolution</a>, but now we'll be inspecting another aspect of Pokemon metamorphosis: <strong>Conditional Evolution</strong>.</p>

        <p>As Pokemon receive experience, they will develop accordingly, gaining strength, skill, and new moves with each passing level. At a certain point, they will have collected enough energy to evolve into a new form and become more powerful in the process. Other species, however, aren't dependent on experience in order to evolve, but require a different kind of stimulus to develop further. The questions the panel will aim to answer are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>What different kinds of stimulus can result in evolution?</li>
            <li>Why is this stimulus required for some species to evolve?</li>
            <li>What benefits do the species receive upon evolution?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With us in the studio tonight are our chosen panelists Arcticblast, Bummer, Joeyboy, and shade, represented here by Oddish, Quagsire, Golduck, and Totodile respectively, and the first topic we'll be covering is:</p>

        <p>Exeggcute, colloquially known as the Egg Pokemon, actually shares much more in common with plant seeds than with eggs; it is simply its physical characteristics that earned it its category. If one looks closely at an Exeggcute's shell, small cracks can be easily observed. These cracks highly correlate with the respective Exeggcute's power level. The strongest Exeggcute are often the ones whose shells have completely cracked, leaving an exposed "yoke-y" brain open to attack. While this exposed brain can easily be seen as a defensive weakness, Trainers will quickly tell you that an Exeggcute whose brain is exposed has much more telepathic power than one whose brain is fully encased. While an Exeggcute's power can be easy to detect, its evolution has eluded many newbie Trainers over the years. This is due to Exeggcute being one of the few Pokemon to evolve only with the aid of a Leaf Stone.</p>

        <p>The Leaf Stone is often subject to study due to its unknown properties and its result being impossible to duplicate in a lab setting. The theory behind the stones is that they harbor core nutrients of an ancient plant. These nutrients act as biological "rocket-fuel" for a few Grass-type Pokemon, who usually evolve into a stage barely recognizable from their basic form. This rule applies to Exeggcute, who evolves into Exeggutor, the Coconut Pokemon. Often referred to as the "Walking Tropical Forest," Exeggutor's only similarity to Exeggcute are the three "egg-like" heads it possesses. These three heads raise another unanswered question: Why are there only three when all Exeggcute consist of six separate eggs? The most widely accepted theory is that after exposure to a Leaf Stone, a brief, but fierce, telepathic battle begins between the six eggs. The result of the battle is this: the strongest three go on to become the dominant heads of the Exeggutor while the weaker three are broken down into the necessary nutrients needed to complete the Exeggutor's new body.</p>

        <p>Scientists have been researching evolutionary stones for many years now and there are still very few clear-cut discoveries of note. One such discovery, however, is that Pok&eacute;mon are aware of the respective evolutionary stone(s) which will have an effect on them. This becomes especially apparent in many Pikachu, who seem to become highly anxious when in proximity with a Thunderstone. In an experiment conducted recently, only 15% of Pikachu took up the stone when presented with it and thus evolved into a Raichu. It is not known whether Pok&eacute;mon are fully aware of the consequences of close contact with evolutionary stones, but results do seem to indicate that there is something in a Pok&eacute;mon's psychology that makes it wary of such stones. Studies done on the brains of Pok&eacute;mon showed a 55% increase in neurological activity when an evolutionary stone was in sight, showing that Pok&eacute;mon, potentially subconsciously, are fully aware that the stones have some kind of life-changing potential. Evolutionary stone evolutions are so rare in the wild that it has been questioned if Pok&eacute;mon even want to evolve. Or, if they do, do they need a Trainer to harness the power of the evolutionary stone?</p>

        <p>Regardless, Thunderstones charge Pikachu up so much that it is packed with energy and its cells divide at double the rate, leading to drastic morphological changes and an increased ability to withstand / dish out high-power electrical attacks.</p>

        <p>The Nidoran family are common vermin within Kanto city districts. They breed like rabbits, feed like rats, and are as hostile as bears. Luckily, their lesser forms are easily controlled once discovered, and even their evolved forms can be managed if targeted appropriately. But if you leave Moon Stone jewelry among the trash, you're in for a world of trouble, as the weak radiation from these gems are enough to trigger a most gruesome reaction in these venomous rodents.</p>

        <p>Multiple theories have been made regarding the true nature of the energy emitted from Moon Stones. Contrary to popular belief, it has nothing to with lunar forces, as the affected species aren't necessarily nocturnal or active during the night. Instead, it's generally believed that the rocks give off gamma rays of a specific frequency, which can cause some species to evolve due to how readily it is absorbed into their genome. This affects their gene expression, and in turn, their hormone production, which causes their body to greatly change its composure. For the most part, this sudden metamorphosis still results in a creature which isn't too different from the stage before it, apart from some additional bulk or new features. But in the case of Nidorino and Nidorina, it's nothing short of a werewolf transformation, and the list of radical changes made to these species is long and constantly expanding. They go from being quadrupedal to bipedal, their torso becomes fully developed, and their skin grows thicker to function as both armor and poison storage. In short, no cocktail of growth stimulates could possibly come close to this sudden change in physiology, and while these hazardous behemoths prefer a life in seclusion, a rampaging Nidoking is a force of nature one would be unwise to underestimate.</p>

        <p>Litwick's evolution line is infamous for supposedly destroying the soul of any living creature in close proximity. The most terrifying of these is Chandelure, who can essentially kill its victims twice&mdash;once by incinerating the body and again by burning up the soul. Just about every living thing can rejoice in the fact that Chandelure is not found in the wild. However, it is entirely possible that a wild Lampent can find a Dusk Stone left behind by a careless Trainer and use it to evolve. Why do occurrences like this not make headlines? It's quite simple, in fact. Chandelure is an unstable mutation of Lampent. A controversial study was performed by a group of scientists in Unova where a Lampent, a Dusk Stone, and several Grimer were left in a room together. The Lampent actively sought out the Dusk Stone to evolve and wreaked havoc on the Grimer. Mysteriously, before it could wipe out the Grimer or use up its own PP, the Chandelure collapsed dead on the ground. Chemical tests revealed that Chandelure's cells and DNA had essentially scrambled themselves, causing them to no longer support vital functions. While Unova's recent ban on destructive Pokemon testing has all but halted research, this is a popular theory among Pokemon Trainers, who will often have to resort to extreme methods of care for their own Chandelure.</p>

<div class="align-center"><h2>Link Trade</h2></div>

        <p>Deep in Unova's Chargestone Cave lies an area where even the most powerful Pokemon Trainer cannot reach. It is completely cut off from the rest of the cave, and can only be accessed by rappelling from the top of the lowest available floor. In this deep well, huge colonies of Gigalith and ravenous Eelektross lurk in the shadows. How could any Pokemon exist in an environment so far away from the sun, you may ask? It's simple. The producers have another source of energy. It is believed that the deepest recesses of Chargestone Cave were created by the constant gnawing away of generations of Boldore, who survived on minerals and radiation, taken in from the cave's luminescent rocks. In the wild, it is energy such as this that gives Boldore the energy needed for evolution. Only in the deepest recesses of Chargestone Cave are there Boldore colonies completely cut off from the outside world, as most other Unova caves have a multitude of access areas where Boldore can take in sunlight.</p>

        <p>These Boldore have proved incredibly important in the study of trade evolutions, as the energy in their crystals can be easily measured. The energy expended in a Pokemon trade is incredible, being measured at almost twelve thousand Gigajoules. This is not only far above the requirements for Boldore to evolve, but incredibly wasteful. According to recent theories by celebrated Pokemon scholars, much of this "spare" energy is transferred to Pok&eacute; Balls during a trade, and that energy can be further transferred to the Pokemon inside it. In the case of Boldore, and perhaps all other trade evolutions (with the possible exception of Karrablast and Shelmet), the Pokemon can use this energy spike to trigger evolution. For now, there is little we know for certain about the process of trade evolution, but we can marvel at these amazing Pokemon!</p>

        <p>Haunter is a very mysterious Pokemon. It is well documented that simple battle experience evolves Gastly into Haunter because as Gastly grows stronger, its body, which can be made up of as much as 95% gas, becomes more and more corporeal. While Haunter isn't the most physical Pokemon, its form is more solid than any Gastly. This finding would leave many to believe that in order to evolve Haunter into Gengar a similar method would have to occur, as Gengar is also much more corporeal than Haunter. But there has been no evidence that a Haunter can evolve through battle experience alone; it takes a rather odd solution to evolve it.</p>

        <p>Evolving a Haunter, as many of you will know, involves trading your loyal Ghost-type Pokemon to another fellow Trainer. It is only through this method that you will be able to utilize Haunter to its full potential. Most pseudo-intellectuals will tell you that its obvious why Haunter evolves this way; trading a Pokemon exposes it to a rare kind of radiation that is found during trades. But it has actually been found that a Haunter simply exposed to the radiation in a lab, minus the trading, will not evolve. Thus, the radiation is not truly the cause of evolution. There is a myth as to why Haunter evolves through trading. It is that as Haunter travels between the two Trainers it is able to tap into the shadows, and the foul thoughts of them both. Haunter feed off these things and with twice as much to "eat," it quickly gains strength and reaches evolution.</p>

        <p>Machoke and Gurdurr are both strong fighters which dedicate their whole existence to the mastering of physical combat and blunt violence. Be it straight punches, quick throws, or thumb wars, they continuously strive to excel their skills, with a high metabolism to account for their strenuous activities. But given the strength they can build up from personal training alone, once they are caught or given to a Trainer for the first time, they instantly bond with their new guardian, and it has been proven that these two fighters develop better under an overseeing presence.</p>

        <p>With that in mind, the fact that they evolve after being traded to a different Trainer has for a long time been disputed. Neither Machoke nor Gurdurr requires more energy absorbed from the transfer in order to evolve, as they're both saturated with power prior to their evolution. For that reason, many believe that their evolutionary trigger is instead of a psychological nature. This, too, has spurred a plethora of different theories. The trade could be seen as proof of their adulthood, where they no longer require the aid of their original Trainer and are prepared to serve a new ally. The reverse is equally possible, where this sudden exchange causes them to evolve further, in hopes that their old master would have a change of heart and reclaim their services (which is often the case). There is, of course, another theory that their transformation is merely fueled by their anger and rage due to the sudden dismissal from their Trainer, but the number of murder incidents related to both custody exchanges and Pokemon assaults aren't nearly as numerous to make a conclusive statement. The fact remains that a Pokemon trade is the right kind of stimulus required for their final form, and it has been a major boon to Trainer interaction ever since.</p>

        <p>The Abra line of evolution is one of great interest to scientists and Pok&eacute;mon professors. Often thought to be the most intelligent Pok&eacute;mon going, it is constantly wondered why Abra even evolves at all. With its ability to teleport away from danger, most wild Abra are generally untouchable by the region's apex predator. It is thought that Abra and Kadabra's evolution comes from a desire to attain more knowledge, further their intellect, and therefore further their psychic powers. Kadabra is not a particularly physically powerful Pok&eacute;mon, therefore it requires the energy impulse from the trade with another Trainer to combine with its huge psychic power. This, coupled with the aforementioned desire to attain more information, catalyzes the transformation of Kadabra into Alakazam. This evolution is thought to be the most energy rich and expensive evolution in the entire Pok&eacute;mon world.</p>

        <p>Another theory is that Alakazam is the antithesis of another trade-linked evolution Pok&eacute;mon&mdash;Machamp. Some believe that these two evolutionary lines have been evolving side by side for generations, constantly trying to outdo each other. An evolutionary battle of brains and brawn seems to have developed, with both lines striving for the ultimate final form. In Alakazam's case, this final form requires the input of energy that can seemingly only come from a trade with another Trainer. Kadabra trades are one of the most sought after in the world, and people have been known to pay thousands of Pok&eacute; Dollars for such a trade.</p>

        <p>Just looking at a Munchlax's belly will tell you everything you need to know about its affinity for food. To keep it happy, you almost need to feed it its own bodyweight in order to fill its daily quota. This tends to be a herculean task and often puts off many Trainers from actually raising the cute balls of lard. However, a recent discovery found that a Munchlax's evolution into Snorlax is linked to its happiness. Now, how do you keep a Munchlax happy? Not the trickiest problem you will ever come across. When a Munchlax has eaten its fill, its cells have enough energy to divide at a rapid speed. This leads to huge change in size and turns your cute little Munchlax into the Goliath that is Snorlax.</p>

        <p>However, that's not where the avid Snorlax Trainers' problems end. Snorlax, despite sleeping for a large majority of the day, consume much more food than any Munchlax. So, keep your Pok&eacute; Dollars in mind before you set out on attaining a Snorlax. It may be a formidable battler and an excellent mattress, but you might need to hire a chef to follow you in order to keep a Munchlax or Snorlax truly happy.</p>

        <p>Woobat, being the fluffy ball it is, has swayed many Trainers into adding it onto their team. Many look forward to the task of raising it carefully and tenderly so that it may one day evolve into Swoobat as a product of friendship and care, and a final testimony to the bond between its Trainer. Or rather, that's the allure of it. Despite the skepticism from a majority of Pokemon breeders, the reality isn't as cuddly as Woobat's furry hide.</p>

        <p>Woobat are, unlike their Zubat brethren, psychic beings, and are in need of neurological stimulus if they are to mature properly. But being the cave dwellers they are, they rarely come in contact with other sentient beings on a longer basis, and intelligent species are even rarer. So when it becomes captured by a traveling Trainer, it's actually a good turn of events, as it now has a perfectly fine mind to harvest energy from. Granted, it takes a long time for it to establish a firm connection to its owner's cerebral network, which is directly proportional to the affinity between the two. As their trust grows stronger, Woobat's infiltration goes deeper. Eventually, the connection will be strong enough to support a direct absorption of the Trainer's emotive surplus, thus giving Woobat what it has always lacked: feelings. While they may not seem like it, Woobat are purely objective creatures, where any behavior reminiscent of happiness can be attributed to mimicry. But with this emotional download, they have a tangible blueprint to replicate indefinitely within their own mind, causing them to evolve into the lovable Swoobat. While ordinary Trainers have nothing to worry about concerning this one-time transfer, continuous breeding of these creatures is not recommended, as many breeders have developed apathy as a result.</p>

        <p>Friendship evolutions are some of the most bizarre evolution trends known to Pokemon for the sheer number of variations in evolution that are produced. Patterns like those seen in baby evolutions are sharply contrasted by the results of Bummer's studies with Woobat, for example. Take two examples that are nearly polar opposites: Swadloon and Golbat. Sewaddle is given its first set of "clothes" by its parent Leavanny. It eventually evolves into the perpetually glum Swadloon. It can stay in this phase permanently, but its mood can gradually increase. When it reaches an emotional trigger point, such as the kindness of a Leavanny or the formation of a bond to its Trainer, it releases a rush of endorphins that can often trigger evolution.</p>

        <p>Golbat, on the other hand, is a cold-hearted and cruel Pokemon, known to even directly attack inexperienced Trainers and leave them for dead. For years, the general public believed that Golbat was the end-all, be-all of cruelty. Suddenly, a team of researchers discovered Crobat&mdash;which immediately gave its researchers a sort of flying hug! Further studies confirmed that this was indeed a friendship evolution. The reveal of these studies shocked the world. How could a cruel creature such as Golbat evolve by friendship? Many scientists now believe that Golbat's evolution is triggered by the brain in a sort of epiphany. Golbat tend to believe that the anger inside them is their source of happiness, and they live their lives savagely attacking their prey for both sustenance and enjoyment. It is here where surprising parallels can be drawn between Swadloon and Golbat. It is believed that when Golbat witnesses an act of kindness, it can be so moved that it gives up its old emotions and unlocks its true potential. As wonderful as this theory is, the only part that can be proven is the brutality of Golbat's nature, and the truth about its evolution to Crobat is still a scientific mystery.</p>

        <p>Riolu is a Pokemon well known for being extremely amicable and willing to help anyone to the best of its abilities. Because of these grand qualities, it quickly became a favorite among budding Pokemon Trainers. When interviewed, these Trainers tend to say things along the lines of, "Riolu is my go-to Pokemon; it always delivers!" or "Riolu is my best pal; it's always right by my side." It's incredibly common for Trainers to swoon with Riolu's praise, and this is almost all due to Riolu's unique ability to sense auras. Riolu has an innate power to see an almost unreadable force that all life seems to emanate. These auras can tell the reader any number of different things about the target, from its truest emotions, its goals, or even its fears. With this sense, Riolu will quickly connect with its Trainer in ways many cannot hope to replicate. Since Riolu knows exactly how the Trainer feels, what the Trainer wants, and how he or she wants it done instinctively, a bond of reliability is cemented early.</p>

        <p>This bond only continues to grow stronger, and as it grows Riolu is able to explore its aura sensing powers to greater and greater lengths. Riolu will only evolve once its aura sensing powers have properly matured, but those powers will only mature once it has connected with a Pokemon Trainer on a very deep level. It is through this almost symbiotic relationship that Riolu will finally evolve into Lucario. With its aura sensing powers fully nurtured, a Lucario will know its Trainer as well as they know themselves and its very common for a Lucario to be able to communicate directly with its Trainer via telepathic thoughts. Extraordinarily strong Lucario have even been known to be able to communicate with total strangers due to their mastery of aura.</p>

        <p>Sneasel is a highly specialized Pokemon that has adapted to every environment it is found in, be it the frigid northern routes of Sinnoh or the warm grasslands surrounding Mt. Silver. Sneasel often hunt in pairs, with one member distracting a target Pokemon while the other steals its eggs. Lone Sneasel are even known to ambush and kill small Pokemon like Delibird and Clefairy. It's fitting that a Pokemon like Sneasel would be one to evolve by unique means&mdash;level up while holding a Razor Claw at night.</p>

        <p>The timed evolution requirement is rather odd, and is believed to be related to radiation from the Sun (during the day, the Sun is more direct, while at night its light must reflect off of the moon). As for the impact of the item, the Razor Claw is composed of trace minerals and elements such as bismuth that are not normally found in a Sneasel's diet. The surge of energy caused by leveling up has been shown to have some effect on the Razor Claw, which causes a transfer of atoms between the item and the Pokemon and as a result triggers evolution. If a Sneasel holding a Razor Claw were to level up during the day, this atom transfer would still happen, but the higher levels of solar radiation would suppress evolution. It is believed that this is how both Sneasel and Weavile are able to learn Metal Claw by level up. If a Sneasel not holding any item levels up at night, it does not receive the trace elements required to evolve. Unfortunately, further testing on this subject is slow, as approaching a pair of Sneasel without a Skarmory partner or a suit of chain mail is quite risky indeed.</p>

        <p>Clamperl is a remarkable Pok&eacute;mon in the sense that it possesses the ability to evolve into either a Huntail or a Gorebyss. Having multiple potential evolutions is a relatively rare trait, with most Pok&eacute;mon possessing a single evolutionary pathway. For Clamperl to possess this ability, the cells in its body must already have the ability to divide into Huntail cells and Gorebyss cells. Whilst this is not complete totipotency, Clamperl's cells show remarkable versatility when compared with those of a Pokemon with a single evolutionary pathway. This means that Clamperl can react completely differently under specific situations, due its cells having stem cell-like properties. As a result of this, Clamperl is often the study of stem cell research in laboratories in order to combat many human diseases.</p>

        <p>Due to the aforementioned cell traits, the stimulus of a DeepSeaTooth or DeepSeaScale can lead to drastically different morphological changes. This is due to the fact that each item stimulates the production of different hormones, leading to cells producing very different proteins dependent on which item was used. This different protein production stimulates the evolution of Clamperl into either a Gorebyss or a Huntail.</p>

        <p>Porygon was the first modern Pokemon ever invented by man. It was originally developed to assist scientists in cyberspace, a dimension it could literally travel to. Not long after its creation, work began on modifying the computerized duckling, and results soon followed. Porygon2 was shown around the world as the foremost artificial Pokemon and commercial companies began mass producing the necessary Up-Grade used by Trainers to evolve their own Porygon. It is around this time of mass production, rumor has it, that work began on an even newer upgrade for Porygon2.</p>

        <p>It was many years before any word reached the public ear, but later the Global Space Administration began having unnatural bugs plague most of their satellites. There would be no outward signs of disturbances such as meteorites, yet these satellites would lose much of their functionality overnight. The culprit turned out to be a rogue Pokemon unknown until then, Porygon-Z. It was soon captured by a crack team of astronauts and brought back for study. It shared most of its hardware with Porygon2, except the software that allowed Porygon2 to adapt and learn had been almost totally rewritten. This new program caused Porygon-Z to act incredibly erratically, and also vastly increased its offensive capabilities. Investigators were able to find where the Pokemon had originated from: a group of hackers based in Sinnoh. They had tinkered with the tech found in the standard Up-Grade and used this new Dubious Disk to evolve a Porygon2. Because of these hackers, Up-Grade has had numerous anti-tampering measures added to them. Rumor has it that copies of the original Dubious Disk exist, and many Trainers will pay quite handsomely to have the offensive powerhouse Porygon-Z on their teams.</p>

        <p>It was long believed that Magmar was the final stage of the Magby line, as it possessed decent base stats and a well developed physique. But as Unova researchers discovered that even this lava duck could receive a boost from Eviolite, it was a definite proof that there were still untapped potential left within its genome. Many researchers tried anything to be the first to unlock its secret form, but to no avail. It was traded, befriended, exposed to every evolution stone imaginable, but no method created a response. So with most things, we had to find the answer within nature itself.</p>

        <p>The first Magmortar was found in an area adjacent to a supervolcano, which days before had ravaged the surrounding area. It was swiftly caught, studied, and then released back into the volcano along with a heat resistant tracker. The tracker lasted for about an hour, as it only resisted degrees up to 3000° F, but the research team managed to pinpoint its course and sent in several Magmar of their own in an attempt to lure this mysterious evolution back to the surface. When they returned, all of them had evolved into Magmortar, and thus it was quickly concluded that the immense thermal energy and properties of magma deep below the Earth's crust was the stimulus this fire dweller required. Granted, being within the vicinity of an active volcano was too much of a risk for amateur Trainers who wanted their Magmar transformed, so a safer way to trigger their evolution was required. Some years later, the first Magmarizers hit the market, which contained pulverized magma rocks and exothermic reagents, which together with the energy during Pokemon trades results in a burst of "magma energy" that triggers Magmar's process of evolution. At least according to the product pamphlet.</p>

        <p>The shaggy hog Piloswine is valued by many people in Pokemon society. It has decent stats in battle supplemented by powerful moves such as Earthquake, its fur is prized among high-income members of society for its surprisingly soft texture, it can pull a farmer's wagon when it has to, and in a pinch it tastes good (if a little juicy). There's one other thing about Piloswine that stands out beside its huggability. It can be taught the move Ancientpower through the Move Relearners scattered across the Pokemon world. It has been pointed out by many that genes can actually be reactivated when a Pokemon is taught a move in this manner. In this case, Piloswine's genome is reactivated in so many places that it can be hard to keep track of them all!</p>

        <p>The necessary enzymes to read these genetic changes can't be created until Piloswine levels up, when spare energy is readily available. At this point, Piloswine's new genes are rapidly read and evolution occurs, creating the mammoth-like Mamoswine. Mamoswine do exist in the wild in the Giant Chasm; however, the Giant Chasm is an entirely different environment, and the circumstances are quite different. Mamoswine may have evolved at first in the wild in response to the local Metagross population&mdash;to this day, clashes between Metagross and Mamoswine are both common and violent (but not fatal) in nature. Mamoswine's victory ensures that their offspring can also evolve into Mamoswine.</p>

        <p>What's pink, has a huge appetite, and can coat a large variety of objects with slime? With the exception of unpleasing individuals you may know of, these traits are an accurate description of Lickitung, which is renowned for being a species whose biggest muscle can easily fit within its mouth cavity. Living a life where the main objective is to satisfy its daily hunger has worked out fairly well so far for this tongue twister. However, Lickitung is a slow creature, in more than one way. With a lagging tail, clumsy body, and slow reflexes, getting around the environment while also staying away from predators is one of the largest issues of its daily life. But rather than making use of their scrawny limbs, more and more specimens were discovered to use Rollout to spin themselves away. But not as Lickitung.</p>

        <p>In a process which is still shrouded in mystery, any Lickitung knowing the move Rollout can at any time evolve into a rounder form officially known as Lickilicky. With thinner arms and legs, along with a smaller tail, this ample gourmand is more suitable for rolling at higher speeds with less effort required. Researchers have theorized that this move activates many cognitive processes within the minds of Lickitung, which allows its body to prepare the accommodations to better adjust its proportions and bulk. It did, however, take a long time before a definite link between the move Rollout and Lickilicky was clearly confirmed, thanks to Trainers who trained this species. Granted, earlier versions of TM04 enabled people to teach Lickitung Rollout, and Move Tutors in Hoenn also have documentations of the same accomplishment, but with no spontaneous evolution of Lickitung as a result. This has led many to believe that Lickitung's instincts play a large role in its development, and thus, directly teaching the move to it won't have the same effect. It's something they need to figure out on their own.</p>

        <p>Aipom is a Pokemon who has a very unique niche in the natural world. Due to its strong hand-like appendage on its tail, it lives mostly in wooded areas, using its tail to swing nimbly from tree to tree. It also uses its tail to nab fruits from the same trees where it lives; its tail is used so often that its actual hands receive very little use. It is partly due to this disuse of its true hands that leads Aipom towards its evolution. You see, Aipom are actually extraordinarily inefficient creatures simply because they really only have one limb, their tail. It is used in all the work the Aipom does, from carrying for their young to protecting their territory.</p>

        <p>This inefficiency led to the eventual evolution of the Aipom, in what is one of the most interesting finds in the Pokemon world. It is so interesting to scientists because most Pokemon simply evolve as a means to grow, think of it like aging for us humans, but the Aipom finally evolved because it made them more efficient. It was an evolution rarely seen in the Pokemon world. At some point, it is theorized, there was born an Aipom who learned the move Double Hit. This move, however, is much too difficult for any Aipom to properly perform as, again, it only has one suitable limb for attacking. But this Aipom endured and willed itself to master the move and soon evolved into Ambipom. This new form, with its two tails, is seen as a pre-adaptive trait and the move Double Hit soon spread throughout the world's Aipom population. It is believed the first Ambipom originated in the Sinnoh region, somewhere near the Eterna Forest.</p>
