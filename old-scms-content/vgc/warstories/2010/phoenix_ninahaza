[title]Saturday Morning-it begins[/title]
I wake up at 3am rushing to the seattle/tacoma airport to catch my flight. i arrive in phoenix at 8:03am and my eyes are very heavy because i only have 3 hours of sleep under my belt[that would last me the whole day with no energy drinks what so ever] thats right i was running on pure VGC excitement. i quickly get to my hotel, drop my stuff [including my pokewalker CRAP] and rush back to the airport to catch the bus that would take me to the convention center [woot for not getting lost first time attempt]. on the bus i meet a fellow contender who is on the skarmbliss forums and i even think here on smogon[less active] named JoJo

yep you may remember him from his gengar earings, pretty cool guy
 
[B][U]VGC-the middle[/U][/B]
so we both get off the bus and Roar into the convention hall like thunder and lighting, feeling sorry for the trail of victims we were gonna leave behind.....[B]HA jk. [/B]i dont know about JoJo but i was feeling very nervous, did i practice enough?, was my team ready to counter and be uncounterble? did i just waste a bunch of money?, 
 
"my team has been taken out of the story but will be back soon"
 
[B][U]VGC-THE MAIN EVENT[/U] [que eye of the tiger music merriland][/B]
JoJo and i wasted a bunch of time chilling inside the room instead of linning up we ended up having to wait in line longer than we should have.
[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab289/ninahaza/vgc/vgc004.jpg[/IMG]so here we are all bored.

FINALY we are getting there. i was starting to feel the heat and doubts
 
[B]battle 1- DING DING[/B]
this was by far the easiest battle for me to have EVER, well expect for all the npc's in pokemon games on roads. i dont know why nintendo makes them so dam easy.
he led with togekiss and magmortar.  i won pretty easy 4-0 
[B]battle 2-DING DING[/B]
this was the most interesting team ever. this guy's lead was jolteon and espeon, his back ups were unbreon and glacion. i also again did not get to find out this guy's strategy. my God the [B]EON [/B]family [except for unbreon] have weakass defences, his team was so interesting and the match was so fast i decided to ask him what his strategy was. he said all his pokemon had hidden power something and had insane speed [maybe scarfed on 1 idk] and that he owned in battle one and when he was playing people for fun earlier. go figure i win 3-0
 
[B]battle 3-DING DING[/B]
if u look at the last picture above u can see the guy with the long blondish hair. well this was him. i cant quite remeber his team but it was a very 1 sided battle. so he leads something cresselia. i am almost 100% sure it was kyogre/cresselia lead. i win 3-0
 
[B]battle 4-DING DING[/B]
i was really worried going into this one because my opponent was one of the 2 African-American brothers who had big afros. he was a really cool guy and they were both sweeping the competion. he leads Marowak and slowking and i blank out. i am like WTH, i cant predict this lead and why. o well i win 3-0 whiles his brother makes it to the finalists lounge.
 
[B]BREAKTIME-chilling with JoJo, badintent and ipl in the lounge and taking pics[/B]

badintent ofcourse. i had to get a Pic with him, nice to meet you aswell.
 
[B][U]ok Funtime over, time to get back to bissness says the staff.[/U][/B]
alright so the staff explains to us how the whole "who gets byes" thing works. in the end the girl infront of me gets the bye because she got the yellow card. GAAAAAA if only i had gotten infront of her. that day i drew the line on how far i let the"[B]ladies first"[/B] saying convince me to actually let ladies go first. those who did not get a bye were led to the stations to battle it out and see who gets to top 16 atleast, anyways i was at the station staring into my opponents eyes telling him Good luck whiles deep inside it was more like "i cant loose now, i have come to far, spent to much money and i am winning this whole dam thing damit and if i dont i am atleast getting an invite to nationals or so help me God" with such burning determination the battle started.
 
[B]Battle 5- ding ding[/B]
this guy had a full 100% water/raindance team. holy crap it was about dam time i saw a 100% raindance team. and he was Good i could see how he got as far as he did. he had the common Kyogre on his team but then he also had lapress and omastar and i didnt know what kind of edit he made to the common raindance team but i played hard and i was home free and made it into the top 16 WOOOOOOOOTTTTTTT.
 
[B]Battle 6-DING DING[/B]
well my oponent was shinryu and all i can say is the better man won. his team was very unique and the sprise of it eventually became my downfall. i forgot to save the vid :(. he lead weavile and a hypnosis persian.
 
[B][U]the aftermath[/U][/B]
after getting my ass handed to me i grabed a drink and cheered on people as i watched the rest of the contest to see who won, i taped the semi-final of shynryu but the first 55 secs of it isnt working so if i posted it it woulda be with the first round of the battle almost done. after xerograde was crowned i had some more fun with pictures
