Restores health based on the weather.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals the user by 1/2 of its maximum HP if no weather conditions are in effect, 2/3 of its maximum HP if the weather is sun, and 1/4 of its maximum HP if the weather is hail, rain, or sandstorm, all rounded half down.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The PP and reduced recovery in other weather conditions beyond sun hold this move back, but Synthesis is still usable. If your OU sun team seems to have little trouble keeping sunlight up, consider throwing Synthesis on any Pokemon that can spare the moveslot to keep them in good health. In RU and NU, where there are no automatic weather inducers, Synthesis is a good choice for keeping any bulky Grass-type Pokemon you may have, such as Eviolite Roselia and Tangrowth, in prime condition.</p>
