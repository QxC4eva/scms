<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While sun is the prevailing weather condition, the wielder's Special Attack is increased by 50% and it loses 1/8 of its maximum HP per turn.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The one really good user of Solar Power is <a href="/bw/pokemon/charizard">Charizard</a>. You won't see it too much but when you do, you will know about it when you do. With <a href="/bw/abilities/drought">Drought</a> support from <a href="/bw/pokemon/ninetales">Ninetales</a>, its STAB Fire-type attacks are monstrous. Other Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/sunflora">Sunflora</a> should never be used in OU anyway so the only example you will really find is Charizard.</p>
