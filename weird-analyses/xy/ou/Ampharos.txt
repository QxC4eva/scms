Overview
########

- Extremely high Special Attack
- Good defenses and typing allows it to switch into common threats such as Rotom-W, Mega Scizor, Charizard Y and Talonflame
- Dual STAB that is very hard to switch into
- Extremely slow
- Mold Breaker is a good ability but has little use on Mega-Ampharos
- Obviously a Mega in team preview
- Takes up Mega slot
- Weak to common attacking types such Dragon and Ground
- Doesn't get Draco Meteor

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Dragon Pulse
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Static
item: Ampharosite
evs: 252 HP / 44 SpA / 192 SpD / 20 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
- Volt Switch keeps up momentum and is decently powerful.
- Dragon Pulse is Mega Ampharos's only Dragon-type STAB, and is the most powerful attack on the set.
- Together these have great neutral coverage, only being notably resisted by Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Whimsicott, and Magnezone.
- Rest keeps Mega Ampharos healthy, and allows it to shrug off any status, making it a complete counter to Rotom-W.
- Sleep Talk keeps Mega Ampharos from being a sitting duck after Resting.
- Focus Blast can be used over Sleep Talk if the team has a cleric, although Sleep Talk is generally better

Set Details
========

- 252 HP is to take hits as well as possible, as this is the set's job
- 20 Speed allows Mega Ampharos to outspeed 0 speed hippowdon, and 44 Special attack allows it to 2HKO 252 HP/0 SpD Hippowdon. The rest is in Special Defense as most of the hits Mega Ampharos is supposed to tank are special
- RestTalk is a much more viable strategy now due to the new sleep mechanics


Usage Tips
========

- This set should neither be played as a wall or a completely offensive Pokemon, it is supposed to switch into certain Pokemon and hit hard back while gaining momentum
- RestTalk allows it to not get worn down and consistently wall Pokemon such as Talonflame or Thundurus
- Volt switch is Mega Ampharos's "spammable" move, as it will at the worst get switch initiative on every Pokemon that isn't a ground type. Mold breaker is somewhat useful here, as volt absorbers can't stop Mega Ampharos from getting momentum.




Team Options
========

- Works well with a volt-turn core that it can be a part of.
- Skarmory can switch into Dragon and Ground type moves, while mega Ampharos takes the Electric and Fire type moves that force Skarmory out. Skarmory also switches into Excadrill well, a Poke that is a huge problem for Ampharos,
- Good against stall, as while most stall teams will have counters, it will be very hard for stall teams to kill Mega Ampharos due to RestTalk. Gaining countless switch advantages through the match on stall staples such as Skarmory is conducive to stall breaking as well.

Tank
########
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Dragon Pulse
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Heal Bell / Thunderbolt / Discharge
ability: Static
item: Ampharosite
evs: 252 SpA / 20 Spe / 236 HP
nature: Modest

Moves
========

- Volt Switch is once again the main move, hitting decently hard while getting momentum for Mega Ampharos's team
- Dragon Pulse is the only option as Dragon STAB, and is a consistent, albeit slightly weak move
- Focus Blast destroys many common switch-ins to Amoharos, such as Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn
- Heal Bell is a rare move and can provide important team support, and is the recommended option for this set
- Thunderbolt is a more reliable Electric Stab, and is Mega Ampharos's most powerful move on this set, but Volt Switch is usually better. Discharge can also be used for the paralysis chance, which can be useful due to Mega Amoharos's low Speed


Set Details
========

- 20 Speed is to outspeed 0 speed Hippowdon, who would other wise threaten Mega Ampharos with Earthquake
- 252 Special Attack is to hit as hard as possible, as this set is a bulky tank that is supposed to dish out a lot of damage. The rest is in HP to take hits, which is necessary due to Mega Ampharos's slowness.


Usage Tips
========

- This set is meant to be played as a tank
- It hits much harder than Rest-Talk, but loses its ability to repeatedly switch into status and weaker attackers
- Still a good switch-in to many Pokemon, especially bulky Water, Electric, Fire, and Grass types

Team Options
========

- Still synergizes well with Skarmory
- Almost any teammate appreciates the use of Heal Bell, as any Pokemon can be crippled by the right status
- Needs teammates that can beat special walls, as this set struggles to take them down and is easily stalled out. Any physical attacker, such as Scizor or Terrakion make great partners
- Works very well on a trick room team due to combination of bulk, power, and low Speed




Other Options
########

- Thunder can be used on a rain team, but is still inconsistent due to lack of consistent rain, making it a risky option no matter what
- Agility can be used to make up for Mega Ampharo's low speed, although it is still fairly slow even after an agility, and isn't powerful enough to make up for it, making this set more trouble than its worth
- Signal Beam can be used to beat Celebi, but is generally useless otherwise


Checks & Counters
######## 
**Specially Defensive Hippowdon**: This is the best counter to Mega Ampharos, refusing to be 2HKO'd by anything in its arsenal, while it can retaliate with an Earthquake that 2HKOes. It also blocks Mega Ampharos's Volt Switch.

**Tyranitar**: Tyranitar's titanic special bulk refuses to take serious damage from both VOlt Switch and Dragon pulse, commonly responding with Earthquake. However, Focus Blast does serious damage to it.

**Ferrothorn, and Excadrill**: These two resist both of Ampharos' STAB and as such as good counters to sets lacking Focus Blast

**Special Walls**: Although Volt Switch can easily gain switch advantage special walls such as Chansey or Sylveon they can easily take anything Ampharos can throw at it. In Chansey's case it ends up in a stall war with the RestTalk set that it can not win, however it will find many free turns to heal its teammates or set up Stealth Rock against Ampharos.

**Revenge Killers**: Anything with an ounce of speed will outpace Ampharos and as such offensive Pokmon with a strong super effective attack to hit Ampharos with will easily check it.
