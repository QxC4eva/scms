Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Sacred Sword
move 4: Shadow Sneak / Shadow Claw
ability: No Guard
item: Eviolite 
evs: 196 Atk / 116 Def / 140 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Swords Dance for sweeping late game 
- Iron Head is the main STAB
- Sacred Sword for coverage, namely Pawniard. 
- Shadow Sneak lets it pick off weakened Pokemon like Misdreavus, Abra, and Meditite, or letting it sweep weakened teams late game. 

Set Details
========

- Eviolite is preferable to Berry Juice on Honedge because of the inevitability of it being hit by Knock Off.
- Spread maxes Attack but has enough in Def to avoid KOes from common Earthquake and Knock Off users. It can even take a Carvanha Crunch most  of the time. Rest is in SpD to avoid a KO from Misdreavus Shadow Balls most of the time. 

Usage Tips
========

- Honedge is a pivot-set up sweeper. It checks Pokemon like Fletchling, Bunnelby, Meditite, and Spritzee and uses that opportunity to set up Swords Dance  or it hits counters with a moderately powerful Iron Head/coverage move.
- It is best to save Swords Dance for a time when Honedge can sweep or take an opponent down to very low HP to KO and break a wall for another sweeper. 

Team Options
========

- Honedge is very much a team player. It would have a very hard time getting past any bulky Fighting-type with Knock Off without a Pokemon such as Pawniard to weaken them and using Knock Off. 
- Spritzee or Lickitung with Wish also make good teammates for Honedge because they lure in Poison, Steel, and Fighting-type attacks, which Honedge can easily take and heal back up from Wish. 
- Paralysis spreaders such as Ferroseed, Murkrow, and Foongus also make a good combo with Honedge because it not only helps with its low Speed, but gives the possibility for paralfinching. 

Autotomize Lure
########
name: Autotomize
move 1: Autotomize
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Sacred Sword
move 4: Destiny Bond 
ability: No Guard
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 196 Atk / 116 Def / 132 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Autotomize boosts Speed to outpace counters. 
- Iron Head is main STAB
- Sacred Sword for coverage, namely Pawniard. 
- Destiny Bond lets Honedge take out one of its counters when its done, and allows it to easily take out Pawniard or Murkrow with Sucker Punch.

Set Details
========

- Eviolite is preferable to Berry Juice on Honedge because of the inevitability of it being hit by Knock Off.
- Spread maxes Attack but has enough in Def to avoid KOes from common  Earthquake and Knock Off users. It can even take a Carvanha Crunch most  of the time. 
- Speed hits 11 to outpace 20 Speed Pokemon after an Automize. 

Usage Tips
========

- This Honedge is a good early-mid game check, and a late-game cleaner.  However, it has the option of taking out one of its counters, namely  Fighting-types or other bulky Pokemon. 
- After an Autotomize, it is important to decide which Pokemon Honedge  wants to take out for your other Pokemon to sweep. For example, if you  are relying on a Carvanha sweep, you should use Automize + Destiny Bond  to take out Timburr or Mienfoo. 


Team Options
========

- This Honedge is more offensive oriented. It removes Fighting-types  most of the time, meaning Carvanha, Tirtouga, Pawniard, and Scraggy make  great parters. With most of those, Spritzee is also a counter but Honedge can switch into Moonblast quite easily as well. 
- It also does a good job of removing Sucker Punch users, such as Murkrow and Pawniard, so Pokemon such as Gastly greatly appreciate it.


Other Options
########

- Small movepool, so not much. Aerial Ace hits Larvesta. Gyro Ball is an  option but does not make much sense since it only hits very fast  Pokemon such as Murkrow harder - where Iron Head would work fine. 
- Life Orb can be used for more power, but it gains few KOes and gets KOed by much more. 
- Restalk can be used for more longevity. 
- Trick Room is ok but it wastes a turn setting up Swords Dance. 

Checks & Counters
########

**Knock Off users**: Pawniard, bulky Fighting types

**Fire-types**: Larvesta, Growlithe, Vulpix, etc.
 
**Ground-types**: Drilbur, Hippopotas

**Dark-types**: Pawniard, Murkrow and Carvanha can't switch in as well, but they can easily revenge Honedge.
