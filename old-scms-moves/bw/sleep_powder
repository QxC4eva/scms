Puts the target to sleep.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Puts the target to sleep. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Pokemon with the abilities Insomnia or Vital Spirit are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sleep Powder, despite its imperfect accuracy, is a great competitive move. Sleep is arguably the best status in the game, especially with BW's sleep mechanics, practically eliminating a Pokemon from the match. Once Sleep Powder hits, sweepers like Venusaur and Venomoth can easily set up on the sleeping opponent and prepare to sweep the opponent's team, as well as allowing teammates like Dragonite set up Dragon Dances and sweep. Sleep Powder is also easily taken advantage of by Roserade, which can use it to set up Toxic Spikes.</p>
