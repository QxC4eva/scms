Overview
########

Sewaddle does not see much usage due to the existence of Spinarak and Surskit. Its six weaknesses and middling Speed make it hard for Sewaddle to come in and set up. However, Sewaddle does have some boons over it's competition, namely in defensive prowess, as well as a new immunity to powder-based moves.


Sticky Web Setter
########
name: Sticky Web Setter
move 1: Sticky Web
move 2: Energy Ball
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Rock
move 4: Air Slash
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Eviolite
evs: 156 HP / 196 Def / 40 SpA / 116 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Sticky Web gives your team the advantage by lowering the Speed of the opponent's grounded Pokemon by one stage. This makes it easier for slower, powerful Pokemon to sweep. Energy Ball is Sewaddle's obligatory STAB attack. Hidden Power Fire is used to hit enemy Steel-types such as Ferroseed and it is further powered up by the sun if it is present. Hidden Power Rock is an alternative to hit Flying-types and Fire-types on the switch-in nailing Larvesta especially hard. Air Slash is to hit opposing Fighting-type Pokemon with, and it also hits opposing Grass-types for decent damage as well.

Set Details
========

The given combination of EVs allows Sewaddle to switch into Stealth Rock multiple times while maintaining it's bulk, and a Bold nature is used to take physical hits better. Chlorophyll is the primary ability, as Overcoat is quite redundant with Sewaddle's new immunity to powder moves and Sewaddle particularly ideal on sand teams either. Swarm is also a mediocre ability, as Sewaddle enjoys more longevity to set up Sticky Web and possibly get a few attacks off while it has the chance, and this set doesn't have a Bug-type attack for Swarm to boost anyways.

Usage Tips
========

Set up Sticky Web when you can; Sewaddle has completed its primary job if this is done. Using Sewaddle as a lead to accomplish this or coming in on Water-, Fighting-, Ground- , or Electric- type moves is usually the best way to go. Sewaddle is also the only Sticky Web user that doesn't have to rely on Focus Sash since it has the defenses to take a few non-super effective hits, and Eviolite helps it considerably in that regard.

Team Options
========

Vulpix is Sewaddle's best partner. Despite sun aggravating Sewaddle's Fire weakness, it doubles its Speed. Pokemon resistant to Fire- and Flying-type moves are also great partners. Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite as well as Water-types including Slowpoke and Mantyke can switch into these moves, while Sewaddle can take Electric- and Ground-type attacks aimed at them. Rock-types such as Archen and Tyrunt also resist Fire and Flying moves, and so they make excellent defensive partners. Also, bear in mind that slower Pokemon can utilize Sticky Web to sweep. Pokemon like Pawniard and Fighting-types such as Meinfoo, and Timburr make good offensive teammates that appreciate the Speed advantage. Offensive sun partners that appreciate some slow-down are Solar Power Charmander and Helioptile.

Other Options
########

A Life Orb Chlorophyll set consisting of SolarBeam / Hidden Power Fire / Bug Buzz / Air Slash is a choice, but is gimmicky. Calm Mind is an option for boosting power and special bulk. Sewaddle has a useful support move in Sunny Day which it can use to double its Speed as well as that of other teammates with the Chlorophyll ability. It's notable that Sewaddle has access to Agility, Iron Defense, Calm Mind and Baton Pass as well as it can use these moves to pass boosts to a teammate. Bug Buzz is a secondary STAB option, but it doesn't hit very many Pokemon for super effective damage, apart from Purrloin and Psychic-types. Lastly, Sewaddle gets Magic Coat to deflect status moves, but its incompatibility with Sticky Web makes it a poor option in most scenarios.

Checks & Counters
########

**Pokemon with super effective moves**:Sewaddle has six weaknesses, all of which are relatively common attacking types. Even with Sewaddle's decent defenses, it cannot withstand even the weakest of Fire- and Flying-type moves.

**Stealth Rock and status**:Sewaddle dislikes Stealth Rock, as it strips a quarter of it's health away each time it enters battle. It is also not fond of status.

**Taunt / Defog**: Defog and Taunt are two moves that make Sewaddle semi-useless or render it set up bait. Sewaddle usually cannot do much against users of these moves

**Specially bulky Pokemon**: It's also notable that any Pokemon with great special bulk can wall Sewaddle. Munchlax and Porygon are able to tank everything Sewaddle has. Spritzee can come in on Sewaddle and heal off any damage taken and set up multiple Calm Mind boosts.
