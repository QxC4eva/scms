Summons hail for 5 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This move generates the hail weather condition for five turns. Any weather condition previously on the field is removed. While this condition is active, all Pokemon that are not of the Ice-type or do not have the abilities Ice Body, Magic Guard, Overcoat, or Snow Cloak will lose 1/16 of their health at the end of every turn. The move SolarBeam will only hit with 1/2 of its usual Base Power. Synthesis, Moonlight, and Morning Sun will only recover 1/4 of a Pokemon's maximum health. Blizzard's accuracy is raised to 100%. Pokemon with Ice Body ability recover 1/16 of their maximum health at the end of every turn. Pokemon with Snow Cloak increase their evasion by 20%. If the user of this move holds the item Icy Rock, the duration of the weather becomes eight turns rather than five. Weather Ball becomes an Ice-type move with 100 Base Power. Pokemon with the Forecast ability become Ice-type. If Hail is used while the hail weather condition is already active, the move will fail.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Hail as a move has been rendered almost entirely obsolete by Abomasnow's ability, Snow Warning. This ability causes a permanent hailstorm as soon as Abomasnow switches in, which is infinitely easier than giving up a precious moveslot to set up Hail, allowing you to pack your team with abusers and supporters. However, hail is generally considered the least favorable weather condition, given its reliance on Ice-types, who have a great number of weaknesses, and so hail is almost unusable without Abomasnow. Don't bother using Hail.</p>
