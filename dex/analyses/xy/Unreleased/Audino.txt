Most ppl are pointing out lack of potential with Audino-M because it doesn't fulfill the same roles as it does normally, but Audino-M definitely does have a great niche. Physically defensive Audino-M with CM seems really neat. CB Adamant Sawk cannot KO in any way; Poison Jab actually misses the 2HKO. Some other fun calcs:
 
252+ Atk Rhydon Earthquake vs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Audino-M: 109-130 (26.5 - 31.7%) -- 33.8% chance to 4HKO after Leftovers recovery
252+ Atk Feraligatr Waterfall vs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Audino-M: 76-91 (18.5 - 22.1%) -- possible 6HKO after Leftovers recovery
252 SpA Choice Specs Typhlosion Eruption (150 BP) vs. +1 252 HP / 4 SpD Audino-M: 178-210 (43.4 - 51.2%) -- guaranteed 3HKO after Leftovers recovery
252 Atk Life Orb Archeops Head Smash vs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Audino-M: 207-243 (50.4 - 59.2%) -- 79.3% chance to 2HKO after Leftovers recovery
 
That last one doesn't exist, but eating a 150 BP move off of a LO-boosted 140 base Attack for under 60% sounds pretty appealing. Plus, you can always use Audino without mega evolving to use it with Regenerator until you need its boosted defenses or are going for the game. It's cool, especially with the right kinds of support.
