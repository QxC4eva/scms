<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 20% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Shadow Ball is the most powerful special Ghost-type attack, and is a great move in its own right. It serves as the primary STAB attack of offensive Ghost-types like Gengar and Mismagius, and has great coverage alongside Psychic and Fighting attacks, becoming a great move on Psychic-types like Alakazam or Reuniclus as well. The oft-neglected side effect of Shadow Ball, the ability to lower the Special Defense of the opponent, can easily turn the tide in the attacker's favor when faced with a special wall. Definitely a fantastic move choice whenever available for special attacking Ghost-types.</p>
