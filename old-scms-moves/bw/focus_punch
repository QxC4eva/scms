[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tightens focus at the beginning of the turn, then attacks. The attack itself has a priority of -3. The move fails if the user is hit by an attack that causes direct damage before Focus Punch is used. The move does not fail if the opponent attacks the user while the user is behind a Substitute. Damage is boosted to 1.2x by the ability Iron Fist.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Focus Punch is extremely powerful and accurate. The free turn required to use the move is best gained by the use of a Substitute, which will shield the user from attacks that may interrupt the move. The strategy is called SubPunch, and one of the most common users is Breloom. With its combination of Spore, Substitute, and Focus Punch, Breloom is able to almost always set up a Substitute and fire off its incredibly powerful STAB Focus Punches. Other notable SubPunch users include Golurk in UU and RU, and Kangaskhan in NU. Focus Punch is powerful, but otherwise impractical without the protection of a Substitute, so other powerful Fighting-type moves, such as Close Combat or Hi Jump Kick, are better choices for general use. However, Breloom is one Pokemon famous for its use of this move.</p>
