<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises Special Attack one stage when HP falls to 25% or less. One-time use.</p>

<p>Provides a one-time 80 Base Power Poison-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Petaya Berries are the item of choice for Pokemon looking to boost their Special Attack while hiding behind Substitutes. Although it is less seen than Salac Berry, Petaya Berry has advantages Salac Berry misses out on.</p>

<p>Since Special Attack will reach +1 with Petaya Berry, many sweepers will complement this boost with other stat boosts. Empoleon, for example, maximizes its sweeping potential through a combination of Agility, Substitute, and Petaya Berry. After dropping below 25% HP, Empoleon becomes very threatening, its power inflated by multiple Speed boosts, +1 Special Attack, and Torrent. This combination is very potent for Pokemon who benefit from Speed boosts more than power boosts (as is the case with Empoleon), or Pokemon who do not have a move to increase their Special Attack. Either way, Petaya Berry is a staple on multiple Pokemon, making it a very useful item for boosting sweepers.</p>
