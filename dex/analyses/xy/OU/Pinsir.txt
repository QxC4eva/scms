Overview
########

With an incredibly powerful Mega Evolution, former NU threat Pinsir has soared through the tiers and now finds itself sitting happily in OU. While normal Pinsir is unusable in OU, with such high power, an above average Speed tier, and a fantastic ability in Aerilate, Mega Pinsir is more than good enough to see use in the metagame. With Aerilate-boosted Quick Attack, Mega Pinsir is also one of only two Pokemon to receive Flying-type priority, which allows it to check a variety of threats and helps it to Mega Evolve more easily. Unfortunately, with its Bug / Flying typing, Mega Pinsir is 4x weak to Rock, which means that it loses half of its health upon switching into Stealth Rock, but with a large variety of entry hazard removers in OU, this usually isn't as large of a problem as you might think it would be. Finally, Mega Pinsir is fairly predictable, as it is nearly always going to run a boosting move, both Quick Attack and a reliable STAB move, and Earthquake for coverage, leaving it with little room for other coverage moves.

Moves
========

With Swords Dance, Mega Pinsir uses its fairly unique typing and good natural bulk to try to set up and sweep the opposing team. Thus, Swords Dance is a necessity for Mega Pinsir, and it works very well with Quick Attack. After the Aerilate boost, Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack hits roughly 78 Base Power, and after a Swords Dance, it can be used to take out most of the Pokemon that would otherwise be able to revenge kill it. Return is an incredibly powerful STAB attack for Mega Pinsir that has no drawbacks. Finally, Earthquake is used to take on the Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-type Pokemon that could otherwise take a hit from Mega Pinsir. Most notably, Earthquake is able to OHKO Aegislash in its Shield forme at +2.

Set Details
========

Pinsir should never be used seriously in OU without its Mega Evolution, so Pinsirite is the obvious choice for an item. EVs are standard for a physical sweeper, maximizing its Attack and Speed, though an Adamant nature can used instead of Jolly in order to OHKO standard Gliscor at +2 with Return and Latios at +2 with Quick Attack after Stealth Rock damage. Hyper Cutter is the most reliable choice for an ability on Pinsir in its regular state, as it keeps Intimidate users such as Landorus-T from lowering its Attack on the switch. Moxie is another viable choice to pick off a weakened foe before Mega Evolving in order to receive an Attack boost. Mold Breaker can also be used to threaten Rotom-W before Mega Evolving.

Usage Tips
========

Pinsir should usually only come into battle late-game after most of its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened or knocked out. Still, it might be advantageous to bring it in earlier on into the match in order to Mega Evolve and pick off a weakened opponent with Quick Attack. Because its regular state has only base 85 Speed, it's best to Mega Evolve against something it can set up on or something that it can revenge kill with its Quick Attack. Mega Evolving is usually only difficult against more offensive teams that can keep up offensive pressure. Against more defensive teams, you can Mega Evolve Pinsir earlier on in hopes of wallbreaking with it. Thanks to its good physical bulk, Mega Pinsir can often set up against physical attackers that do not carry a super effective coverage move, including some variants of Azumarill, Air Balloon Excadrill, and even Bisharp. However, it's usually going to be easier to set up on a forced switch.

Team Options
========

Some of Mega Pinsir's best partners are things that defeat its checks and counters. A good example of this is Choice Specs Gothitelle, which can trap and KO all of Skarmory, Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, and Hippowdon and heavily damage or even remove Zapdos. Another good partner for this reason is Assault Vest Conkeldurr, which can easily switch into Rotom-W and Air Balloon Heatran, as it benefits from being burned, takes little damage from their attacks, and can threaten them with its Fighting STAB in return. A Rapid Spin or Defog user is another necessary partner, as Mega Pinsir relies a lot on its bulk in order to tank faster priority attacks and neutral hits while it sets up. Excadrill is a good partner, as it can use Rapid Spin and deal massive damage to Rotom-W with its Mold Breaker Earthquake, and Life Orb Latias can use Defog and Healing Wish to support Mega Pinsir, while also offering a good switch into Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos. Keldeo is another good partner, as it can come in on Rock-, Ice-, and Fire-type attacks very easily, and it threatens all of Mega Pinsir's best checks. Finally, Tyranitar is a great answer to Mega Pinsir's offensive checks. With its great bulk, Tyranitar can come in on anything that Mega Manectric and Talonflame have to offer and deal major damage to them with Pursuit as they switch out. Tyranitar can also check Thundurus and Raikou, though it will need to watch out for Superpower and Aura Sphere, respectively.

Other Options
########

Close Combat is another option for a coverage move on Mega Pinsir, as it hits Steel- and Rock-types while also being able to do solid damage to Rotom-W. However, not being able to touch Aegislash is a very bad thing, and the Defense and Special Defense drops from Close Combat greatly compromise Mega Pinsir's longevity. Thrash can also be used for an incredibly powerful STAB attack, but because Return is already very strong without any negative side effects, it is often the better option. Bulk Up is usable, but Swords Dance's +2 Attack boost is almost always more beneficial than a +1 Defense boost. Facade would be a decent option on Mega Pinsir if it had to room to fit it on its set, as it would keep it from being useless should it become burned, but with each of its four moves being as important as they are, it should very rarely see use. Feint can also be used over Quick Attack in order to hit Talonflame and Weavile, as well as slower Extreme Speed users such as Dragonite and Lucario before they can hit Pinsir, but the lower Base Power makes this less viable than Quick Attack in most situations.

Checks & Counters
########

**Resistant Walls**: It takes a very specific type of wall to stop Mega Pinsir in its tracks. Pretty much the only Pokemon that keep it from sweeping need to resist both its STAB and its coverage move. Specifically, Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Skarmory are some of the best answers to Mega Pinsir because they need to be especially weakened if Mega Pinsir hopes to take them out.

**Revenge Killers**: Faster priority users or faster Pokemon that resist Quick Attack are solid checks to Mega Pinsir. Talonflame is about as good of an offensive check to Mega Pinsir as you can hope for, as it can outspeed Mega Pinsir and OHKO it with Gale Wings Brave Bird even when using an Adamant nature. Weavile is also faster and can use Ice Shard to deal massive damage to Mega Pinsir. Although it isn't a damaging move, Thundurus is able to utilize its faster Prankster Thunder Wave in order to cripple Mega Pinsir, and it can even take one boosted Quick Attack and OHKO with Thunderbolt. Mamoswine has enough natural bulk to take a boosted Quick Attack and strike back with its own priority Ice Shard. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can outspeed and KO Mega Pinsir, and it even has the bulk to tank an unboosted Earthquake if it happens to miss Stone Edge. Similarly, Raikou and Mega Manectric can both outspeed and revenge kill Mega Pinsir without fearing its Quick Attack.

**Stealth Rock**: Though Stealth Rock is not quite as solid of a method of checking Mega Pinsir, if you are able to keep it up throughout the match, Mega Pinsir will be much easier to take out. For offensive teams, this means setting Stealth Rock and keeping up offensive pressure against the opponent throughout the match in order to prevent them from using Rapid Spin or Defog. For more defensive teams, you should either try to take out the opponent's entry hazard remover or keep setting up Stealth Rock throughout the match.
