<h2>What is Balanced Hackmons?</h2>

<p>The idea behind <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3463764">Balanced Hackmons</a> is simple; any Pokemon can have any move, any ability, and 252 EVs in each stat. While this might seem overpowering, there are a few rules set in place to create a more balanced metagame. Firstly, six abilities are currently banned: Huge Power, Pure Power, Wonder Guard, Shadow Tag, Arena Trap, and Parental Bond. Furthermore, all OHKO moves are banned. Because of its nature, Balanced Hackmons is an incredibly diverse tier filled to the brim with creativity.</p>

<h3>Rules:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wonder Guard, Pure Power, Huge Power, Shadow Tag, Arena Trap, and Parental Bond are banned.</li>
<li>All clauses are off besides OHKO clause.</li>
</ul>
