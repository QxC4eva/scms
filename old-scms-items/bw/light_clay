[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder uses either Light Screen or Reflect, the two moves will stay on the field for eight turns instead of five.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Light Clay is commonly used on dual screen users, which are Pokemon dedicated to setting up Light Screen and Reflectâ€”simultaneously if possible. Because these moves effectively double the team's Defense and Special Defense, they allow frail sweepers to set up with ease. Thus, dual screen Pokemon are commonly used in heavy offense teams. Most dual screen users, such as Bronzong, Jirachi, Uxie, and Cresselia, tend to be bulky. Alakazam is a notable exception, as it is very fast and can set up Reflect and Light Screen before it is attacked or crippled by Taunt. Dual screen users often have a way of quickly switching out and bringing a teammate safely in. This is often done by Explosion (Metagross, Bronzong, and Azelf), U-turn (Uxie and Jirachi), Lunar Dance (Cresselia), and other similar moves.</p>
