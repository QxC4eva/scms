<div class="aside"><p>As Philip7086 walks out, immediately chilling the hot water with the cold Canadian air, Funkasaurus laughs, tossing out the cup and packing away his laptop, before sitting down and facing me to begin the interview.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Hey Funkasaurus, thanks for doing this interview. Your team, the Ever Grande BIGS, is at a decent 2-2 score going in midseason. While that's not terrible when thinking about getting into playoffs, it's not the best either. What went wrong those 2 weeks?</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>Hello, thanks for having me. Well, I think that we got a little careless after winning the first two weeks rather handily. I would say we definitely got a little arrogant after two straight wins, as we were ranked 9th in rey's rankings and amongst the lower 3 in other rankings.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Would you say your team is now cooled down, and you can take the rest of the season on without getting too "high and mighty"?</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>I'd say so. I think we'll be fine for the rest. Also, both the Alpha Ruiners and the Congregation of the Classiest played incredibly well in our matches against them.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>What are your thoughts on the drama preceding SPL&mdash;tiers and dynasties?</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>I'd say that the whole SPL tiers drama was kinda flustering. I, for one, did not like how the tiers situation was handled. The manager vote aftermath definitely changed my whole perspective on this year's SPL. I was rather upset with the decision that was made.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I consider asking a follow-up question, but decide against it based on the look on my interviewee's face.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>And about dynasties?</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>I'm not too big (no pun intended) on the idea of dynasties. A few teams definitely abused the whole retaining thing this year. I would say that retentions should be limited to 3 or 4 maximum to a team.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Who are the people on your team that you would give consideration to being retained if they're still around next year?</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>That's an interesting question. At this point, it's pretty hard to tell who/whom I would retain. It's still pretty early. If Doubles sticks around in SPL, I'd consider retaining BLINGAS. Otherwise, I'd retain Shoka, Alf', Fuzznip, or High Impulse, as they're reasonably cheap to retain and worth it. We'll see how the second half goes!</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>How are you looking forward to the second half? Any teams you're worried about, or confident about beating?</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>Hmm... Looking forward, I'd say our hardest matchup would be vs the Sharks. makiri has been leading that squad strong. I believe we can give them a good run for their money and win that week, as post-midseason BIGs will be strong.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>how does it feel having tab on your managerial team
!</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>tab is cute. That is all.
!
ʕ•͡ᴥ•ʔ</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>What are your opinions on user: Dr Ciel?</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>Ah yes, the doctor. Well, Maria chose not to show up on IRC often to support her squad, so we tossed her out. tab endorsed.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Is that why I can never find user: Dr Ciel to battle for OST? (As of the time of this interview, of course!)</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>Could be. I hear she hangs out on PS! Perhaps; she chills in the role playing channel.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p> Funkasaurus looks conflicted, and adds on something before I can ask the next question.</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>Also, by she, I mean he/she/it.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Alright! I think we're just about done, unless you have some final notes or answers to questions I didn't ask?</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>I got nothing!</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Well then, thanks for&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>A flashback to the auction reminds me of something I wanted to ask.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Wait, one final question (two, really)!</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>Ah!</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>What is the basis of "ah &lt;name&gt;" and "SEND THIS MAN TO THE FROGS"?</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>I'll answer the easier one first. SEND THIS MAN TO THE FROGS came from SPL 4. I was in a Skype call with friends while the auction was going on and I decided to post that every time that user LonelyNess posted a bid on someone. At that point, everyone wasn't too high on the Smog Frogs and the leadership of LN. So it was something funny that caught on.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>And the other phrase?</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>For "ah &lt;name&gt;," I'm not sure. I feel like that came from Skype calls with friends. Like, when I'd join, CrashinBoomBang would be like, "Ah! Funkasaurus"! so it just caught on, I guess.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ls"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_ls.png" alt="ls" /><p>Ah. OK, I think we're finished!</p></div>

<div class="speaker funk"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_funk.png" alt="funk" /><p>Also, it's a nice filler word.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>We exchange some pleasantries, and gives some shoutouts to tab, the BIGS, his homies, and not CTI. He then goes ahead and throws Philip, who somehow was still there, into the "lava," before stepping out of the building.</p></div>
