<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Before I start I hated the fact that this team was copied ridiculously on the ladder by "0teambuildingskill_ladderscrub<random numbers>" and im only just posting it now as its retired with the banning of Excadrill. People also wanted to see it apparently (PK Gaming told me to post it aswell as a few other people) so here you go. This team is my infamous Volt Turn team and was at its height throughout the very last suspect test round that was to be voted on by the masses. Its probably one of if not the best team ive ever built as shown by it being #1 for like 3 weeks until i stopped caring. Its basically perfectly abusive of two of the most broken moves in the metagame; Volt Switch and U-Turn. Alone they suck but when these moves are chained together repeatedly when you keep getting switch advantages on your opponent they wear down counters and open up massive holes into teams (especially with SR up) whilst keeping momentum at the same time which destroys stall, balance, offense etc alike. Alot of you will probably remember this for the unorthodox way i play it. Either way no matter how many copies you've seen of this team i was the person who took the ball and ran with it farther than anyone else because i can/could play it better than anyone else as I'm its creator.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/248.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 180 SpA / 76 SpD<br />
Sassy Nature<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>This is basically standard Sp.Def Tyranitar but with a difference. Stone Edge is way better than Crunch and Pursuit especially (CM Lati@s sets up on Pursuit lol..)imo. Firstly it makes Tyranitar an excellent check for the very broken Volcarona. Stone Edge also actually hits Heatran. Stone Edge also throws alot of people off my tail and dont expect me to be Mixed once i show it so often get free kills. Ice Beam and Fire Blast are a standard fare next, Ice Beam hopefully lures in things like Gliscor and Hippowdon which obviously makes sweeping with Excadrill at the end of games alot easier, it also makes Tyranitar a 100% counter for Roost DD Nite (no one uses EQ anymore plus I can live those anyway). Fire Blast snags annoying steel types like Skarmory which is important to eliminate for the same reason as above. I usually lead with this as Excadrill and Landorus are rather important to the team so having an early advantage is awesome, that and an early Stealth Rock never hurts. Stealth Rock is kind of important to the team but not vital, it helps wear down checks and counters monstrously fast when U-Turn and Volt Switch are spammed. </p>

<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Superpower</p>

<p>Ah Scizor, whilst you were insanely overated last gen, this gen i feel its actually the opposite, well when people dont kill your awesome potential with that horrific Sp.Def Roost set which is so inferior to CB Scizor its unreal. STAB U-Turn coming from 591 Attack hurts like hell and Scizor really is amazing at using it. With SR up and U-Turn, bear in mind Scizor will beat or wear down Skarmory (by going to Rotom-W to force it out or die) so badly throughout the course of a game that Excadrill or Landorus is likely to sweep if you're using Skarm to "stop" Scizor's U-Turns and Skarmory 4x resists the move! So you may have to find something else to take U-Turns from this monster over the course of the game which will wear you down for something else if i chain U-Turns and Volt Switches together. =) Anyway onto the rest of the moveset, Bullet Punch is arguably the next most important move and is obviously great if I'm in a pinch or have played stupid vs something. SuperPower takes out steels but i really dont use it too much truth be told and i mean why would you (well apart from on Ferrothorn) ? U-Turn is the best move on the set with no resistances lol. Lastly filler Pursuit, yeah! Well its not that bad, it opens up stall when they rely on Blissey and i can U-Turn/V-Switch from Celebi/Rotom-W to Scizor and Pursuit it which then makes them struggle with my two aforementioned Pokemon and this especially worked wonders when Hydreigon was on the team too.</p>

<p><strong>Landorus</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Sand Force<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>This in my opinion is the best Scarfer in the game in the sand, really. It has everything the ideal Scarfer needs; its faster than darn near everything, troll speed ftw! It also keeps your momentum, its extremely powerful and can actually take out most of its counters with relative ease. U-Turn once again is probably the best move on this set as it messes with counters such as Rotom-W and Skarmory (when i U-Turn directly to counters) with SR up which open both of them up for an Excadrill kill. Earthquake and Stone Edge rip through near everything that doesn't resist them thanks to its amazing ability Sand Force. Hidden Power Ice is a filler but it does help secure kills on 4x weak Dragons without relying on Stone miss. HP Ice also lures in Gliscor for Exca sometimes. =P This genie is one badass pokemon and is seriously one of the best mons in the entire game. I chose Landorus as a scarfer as faster Pokemon were really annoying such as Latios to earlier versions of this team and I've yet to regret my decision.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-W</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 128 HP / 252 SpA / 128 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Volt Switch<br />
- Pain Split<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Will-o-Wisp</p>

<p>Rotom-W is really such an amazing Pokemon and the entire reason this team works so well. Honestly, Volt Switch and U-Turn chains win so many games alone its unreal and breaks near on every walling combo. Hydro Pump is pretty useful too helping put those punks Gliscor, Excadrill etc in their place its accuracy has been horrible for me though. Will-o-Wisp is chosen to beat the same things HP Fire would beat but also cripples Gastrodon at the same time which can stop Volt Turning chains it also actually wears down Lati@s and all other checks and counters bar Celebi. Pain Split lets Rotom-W heal which is very important as he is rather important to the team. Pain Split also wrecks many of Rotom-W switch ins as they tend to have high HP, im looking at you Gastrodon and Blissey etc. Overall though id say Rotom-W is the lynch pin of this team. If he is around its alot easier to win nearly all the time to be honest.</p>

<p><strong>Celebi</strong> @ Life Orb / Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Leaf Storm<br />
- Recover / Psychic<br />
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>Celebi is amazing in this metagame as im sure everyone can attest to after seeing how annoying NP Celebi is. At first i was using Choice Specs Hydreigon in this slot but he got replaced as explained above much to my dismay. Choice Specs Celebi was put into this team at first as it checks Conkeldurr whom i was struggling with before. To show Specs Celebi's power it even does like 55% to resists such as Lati@s with Leaf Storm and Psychic possibly 2hko's Max HP Scizor with sr up and OHKOing Dragonite (iirc) with SR up. Hidden Power Fire rounds off the coverage crushing Scizor, Forry, Skarm and the like. I have since replaced Psychic for Recover and used a Life Orb to conserve Celebi a little more but im not sure if i prefer it, i mean it does live longer but i miss Psychic's general spamability (new word lol) against checks like Dragonite. U-Turn is a cute move on Celebi and lets me gain momentum on obvious switch outs such as Jellicent and Rotom-W (both of which Celebi counters) and sticks with the theme of Volt Turning. Overall I'm happy with Celebi's spot despite it not being godly like Specs Hydreigon.</p>

<p><strong>Excadrill</strong> @ Air Balloon<br />
Ability: Sand Rush<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Rock Slide</p>

<p>Oh god I'm going to miss this thing. It was so damn good and was/is arguably the best spinner offensive OU has ever seen (and in the game). It sucks that its banned now and even i voted it uber, but it needed to go really. It forced you to use Zong, Scarf weather changer, Gliscor, fighting/water priority or get swept essentially. Ironically I'm using the set that wasnt broken, the Adamant LO set was what got it banned imo because that set is insane. Air Balloon Adamant Excadrill on the other hand is a fantastic Pokemon and is THE best revenge killer and end game swepers in the game and combined with awesome utility its just amazing to be honest. Rapid Spin lets me get rid of hazards which would otherwise cripple my teams as it is constantly switching and really what is going to block this things spins with that massively powerful STAB EQ and Rock Slide coming from like 810 attack ? Exca is also here to revenge kill things along with Landorus if anything goes wrong and really holds this team together. To be honest I think OU has also suffered from him being put in ubers as OU lacks viable spinners and the rest of them lose to Ferrothorn. Plus he checked broken things like D-S and Volcarona etc even if he was broken himself. =/ Not a lot else to say really apart from this thing is essentially irreplaceable on this team and in OU in general, nothing can do what he does. </p>
