Raises stats of the wielder and its partner in sun. 

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Flower Gift is hardcoded to only work for <a href="/bw/pokemon/cherrim">Cherrim</a>. If sun is the prevailing weather condition, the wielder raises its own Attack and Special Defense by 50%. In multi battles, it also raises the Attack and Special Defense of its partners by 50%. Flower Gift's effect stacks. If the sun ends or a new weather condition is brought into play, the wielder's (and its partner's) stats return to normal. If a Pokemon with <a href="/bw/abilities/air_lock">Air Lock</a> or <a href="/bw/abilities/cloud_nine">Cloud Nine</a> is on the field, the wielder's forme reverts to normal. If the wielder uses <a href="/bw/moves/entrainment">Entrainment</a> or is targeted by <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>, the move will fail.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Flower Gift is the sole reason you'd ever want to bother with <a href="/bw/pokemon/cherrim">Cherrim</a>. The 50% boost to Attack and Special Defense aren't very useful when most doubles sun teams will be firing off Special Attacks, but there are a few uses for it. <a href="/bw/pokemon/arcanine">Arcanine</a> becomes much more threatening with a Flower Gift boost at the ready and <a href="/bw/moves/explosion">Explosion</a> becomes a competent option for <a href="/bw/pokemon/heatran">Heatran</a>. Should you be playing in a doubles ruleset that permits the 600+ base stat legendary club, <a href="/bw/pokemon/groudon">Groudon</a> adores the boost Flower Gift provides and it even brings its own sun with <a href="/bw/abilities/drought">Drought</a>.</p>
