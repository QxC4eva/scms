Overview
########
high attack, hits very hard especially with powerful stab spread in eq
good offensive typing and coverage, eq + rock slide + iron head kills p much everything
2 great abilities in sand rush, which makes you super fast in sand, and mold breaker, which lets it kill through levitate, which is otherwise a big annoyance.
not so great defensive typing, weak to loads of common types - fire, ground, fighting, water
dies fairly easily to strong attacks, but has enough hp to withstand a few hits
trick room and priority are really annoying, as excadrill relies on being really fast in sand to do a lot of damage
intimidate + burn are fking annoying cos excadrill needs all its attack


Physical Attacker
########
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Protect

ability: Sand Rush / Mold Breaker
item: Life Orb / Focus Sash
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
earthquake is strong stab spread move
rock slide is good spread that has nice coverage w/ earthquake and can even get the skillful flinch :]
protect is cool for scouting moves, stalling out opposing field condiitons, just surviving a turn etc
iron head is another strong stab but single target, and rounds off coverage with eq + rock slide quite nicely. also more skillful flinches
swords dance can give you a massive boost to your attack, making excadrill effectively have +2 attack and +2 speed in sand. it kills everything oO
Set Details
========
life orb boosts attack so exca can hit even harder than it does already, making it a powerhouse
focus sash can allow exca to survive an attack that would otherwise KO it, and set up a swords dance for easy gg as long as they dont have priority
sand rush boosts your speed in sand, and is the preferred ability as it allows for better sweeping
mold breaker breaks through levitate, which is useful especially vs rotom-w fuck that thing
adamant nature as jolly doesnt get any extra outspeed i dont think, it already outspeeds deo-a which is p much the fastest relevant threat and u want to be powaful
Usage Tips
========
try and keep it til late game, as its a master late game cleaner
try and have sand up when its out so u can outspeed everything :o
if you can afford to have your partner attack instead and protect with exca with no consequences, do it cos you dont want too much lo recoil
switch out if you need to, exca shouldnt be taking too many hits
Team Options
========
SAND is awesome, so tyranitar is a great partner - FOR SAND RUSH BUT U SHOULD KNOW THAT
something that deals with intimidate mons like lando-t, so something such as rotom-w is a good partner
Flying-types and Levitate mons to avoid Earthquake, but no levitate mons if using mold breaker. togekiss, lando-t, thundurus etc are good
mons that deal with opposing grass, flying and bug types are cool so heatran is awesome, but has to watch out for exca's earthquakes
speed controls pretty useful, so something like icy wind cresselia is a great partner
togekiss is awesome, as it can use follow me to deter burns and fighting type moves, as well as being immune to earthquake
wide guard mons like hitmontop and aegislash, as they stop heat wave and earthquake, both of which destroy excadrill. wide guard also protects them from exca's eq which is rly cool

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: X-Scissor / Poison Jab
ability: Mold Breaker / Sand Rush
item: Choice Band
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========
earthquake is a powerful spread stab
rock slide is cool spread coverage move with flinch, hits flying types and stuff
iron head is p strong stab move
x-scissor is final coverage move, hits grass types and psychic types
poison jab also works, hits the grass types as well as some fairy types
Set Details
========
choice band boosts your attack really fucking high while locking you into a move
mold breaker is really cool on this set cos it lets you completely destroy all the levitate/sturdy mons
sand rush is still good for being really fast and powerful
adamant for maximum power, and is definitely the preferred option with sand rush. use jolly with mold breaker if you want to outrun max speed timid rotom-w, otherwise use adamant
Usage Tips
========
most of the time you will be spamming earthquake or rock slide, depending on how many flying mons they have
really try not to have a grounded partner out at the same time when using eq, cos it WILL do a lot of damage
mold breaker helps it smash stuff that would otherwise be troublesome - rotom-w in particular
not really sure what to put here tbh, you just spam powerful moves lol
Team Options
========
sand if using sand rush, so ttar :]
togekiss has follow me to deter burns and fighting type moves, and is also immune to eq
speed control is even better for this set, especially if using mold breaker. icy wind, electroweb and especially tailwind are great. togekiss finds yet another use here as it can provide tailwind which is rly useful for cb exca
wide guard mons like hitmontop and aegislash, as they stop heat wave and earthquake and muddy water, all of which destroy excadrill. wide guard also protects them from exca's eq which is rly cool


Other Options
########
scarf with mold breaker is viable, but generally sand rush is better for going fast
drill run is a good single target ground move that can get around wide guard and not hit your teammate
some good coverage options such as brick break, shadow claw and aerial ace. base power is too weak though :(
magnet rise is an interesting option to avoid the ground type moves its weak to
subsitute is cool for letting it take an extra hit/avoiding status
can run shuca, occa or chople berry to survive some super effective hits

Checks & Counters
########
intimidate mons are annoying because they lower excadrills attack and make it a lot less powerful
lando-t in particular is irritating because it takes jack shit from excadrills moves
cresselia is just really fucking bulky. banded adamant x-scissor doesnt even 2hko max/max cress like wtf ban pls
burns destroy excadrill :(
opposing weather that isnt sand is annoying cos it takes away the sand that lets exca perform at its best
adding on to the above point, swift swim mons in rain just completely destructifyinnihlateiontime excadrill
trick room is a bitch - particularly for sand rush
rotom-w annihilates non mold breaker excadrill
zard-y can set up sun to stop sand and proceed to outspeed all excadrill and ohko
