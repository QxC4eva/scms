<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Been a while since I've posted an RMT. This is a team I've been using for a while and that I had built out of curiosity to see how good the Dragons were in RU. It's a classic DragMag style team: Magneton removes the Steel-types so that the Dragons can more easily sweep with Outrage later in the game. The other 3 Pok&eacute;mon provide support in hazards, spinblock, and spin among other things. It's a very straightforward heavy offense team and one that is a whole metric fuckton of fun to play with in RU atm, even with the hail test. This team also got me reqs for the hail test so there's that. It's a lot of fun, is a decent ladder team, and uses some otherwise lesser used Pok&eacute;mon in the tier!</p>

<p>Also the name comes from Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen from the series Game of Thrones. It's a super good show if you haven't seen it :&gt;</p>

<h3>The Team</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/588.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4>The Lead</h4>
<p><strong>Crustle</strong> @ Custap Berry<br />
Trait: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 204 HP / 252 Atk / 52 Spd<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Rock Blast<br />
- X-Scissor</p>

<p>With a heavy offense team comes a dedicated lead. Custap Crustle is actually a very reliable lead and it's only real bad matchup is against Smeargle, which will usually just go for the Spore meaning I'll just switch to Dragonair immediately to absorb it. There are very few times I'll not lead with Crustle. Crustle will usually get SR and a layer of Spikes up against most teams, and can usually even get a decent hit off too if the situation calls for it. The EV spread is standard for Crustle lead, there's no reason to waste its decent defenses especially for against stuff like Aerodactyl and other Crustle, and there's very little in the tier that hits Crustle at the weird ~50-60% mark which will leave it with only 1 layer of hazards set up.</p>

<p>I usually play Crustle super aggressively because it doesn't offer that much support to the team out of the lead slot. It's too slow to switch in and pose a threat, and it's not THAT bulky to warrant it either, nor does its typing really provide any synergy with the team.</p>

<p>Rock Blast &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cuz fuk Stone Edge and the extra hits let Crustle annihilate lead Smeargle and Snover.</p>

<h4>The Speed</h4>
<p><strong>Rotom</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Trait: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SAtk / 252 Spd<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Volt Switch<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Trick</p>
<p>Scarf Rotom is my revenge killer / pivot / spinblocker / back-up late-game cleaner / stallbreaker and Part 1 of my dual-Electric core. It does so much it's kinda ridiculous. Usually Rotom's best utility comes with using Trick against defensive threats like Quagsire, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and offensive threats like Normal-types like Kangaskhan. Rotom's late-game usefulness cannot be understated for its ability to just blow through things like Gallade, Galvantula, Slowking, and Entei with Shadow Ball and SR/Spikes up alone. Even without any defensive investment Rotom can switch into and survive some surprising attacks like Shadow Sneak from Gallade and Night Slash from Sandslash, which aids in its spinblocking abilities. Rarely is it essential that I keep hazards up for the whole battle, but even if Rotom goes down I should be able to provide enough offensive pressure to keep the opponent from spinning.</p>

<p>The Speed is what makes Rotom so effective, there is so little in the tier that outpaces Scarf Rotom meaning that if I can continually provide offensive pressure against the team there is going to be very few situations where Rotom can't come in and finish the opponent off later in the game.</p>

<p>When combined with the hazards Crustle provides, a dual Volt Switch core is insanely effective. Even if the opponent has a Ground-type to stop the switching, they'll be taking hazard damage as they come in, meaning it'll get easier and easier to push them into KO range for Magneton with Flash Cannon or HP Fire. </p>

<h4>The Power</h4>
<p><strong>Magneton</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Trait: Magnet Pull<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SAtk / 252 Spd<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Flash Cannon<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Volt Switch<br />
- Hidden Power [Fire] </p>

<p>Part 2 of my dual-Electric core and my Steel Killer. With this set Escavalier, Ferroseed, Aggron, most other Magneton, and Klinklang are annihilated. Steelix is either killed or damaged enough by HP Fire for my Dragons to smash through it. Durant is the only major butt that Magneton can't kill cuz of Superpower, but Rotom can usually revenge kill it easily enough or if the player opted out of Superpower for whatever reason Maggy wrecks it.</p>

<p>Specs Magneton hits so hard it's hilarious at times. Stuff like Tangrowth and Druddigon just crumble to Flash Cannon, and everything else can barely withstand Tbolt or Volt Switch. For teams without a Steel-type, Magneton and Rotom usually have a field day just spamming their STAB moves and I relegate them to killing the opponent's Water-types to preserve Dragonair for later in the battle. Magneton is awesome for switching into stuff like Qwilfish which can Taunt Crustle and force it out. Magneton is also my only real safe switch into Spiritomb earlier in the game if I'm not ready to bring out my Dragons. </p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4>The Glue</h4>
<p><strong>Kabutops</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Trait: Weak Armor<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 HP / 252 Spd<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Aqua Jet<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>Kabutops is my spinner and my glue. He's also my switch into the Fire-types that like to bully Magneton out if I had to use something other than Volt Switch. It's amazing how many times even this far into the game of RU that I can still set up a possible sweep with SD Kabu, it just showcases how good it is in the meta. SD also allows me to defeat and spin against most Ghost-types if I can predict the switch. Weak Armor is super cool for when I switch into Flare Blitz from stuff like Entei, which combined with a SD is usually enough offensive pressure to not require my Dragons to even come out and sweep.</p>

<p>Aqua Jet is this team's only priority apart from the Custap, and it's vital in some situations to keep that pocketed when he can KO stuff like Galvantula, Rotom, Moltres, Cinccino, and other frail attackers later in the game with SR up and a few switches. Combined with my Electric core there is very little in the tier that will be left standing to put up a fight against the Dragons.</p>

<p>Thanks to Crustle, Kabu can even sometimes get Tangrowth and Slowking down low enough in health to blow them away with Stone Edge itself. Though, I tend to avoid using Stone Edge if I can help it, the accuracy just kills this team too often. Steelix, Rhydon, and Normal-types like Tauros and Kangaskhan have an easy time coming into Kabu and threatening the momentum of the team, so I usually keep Kabu out of play unless I need to get the spin off or need the priority. </p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/148.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4>The Tank</h4>
<p><strong>Dragonair</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Trait: Marvel Scale<br />
EVs: 4 Spd / 252 HP / 252 SDef<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>

<p>Ah, the centerpiece of the team. Most of the team's efforts are to secure a set up opportunity for this tank. The really cool thing about Dragonair is that it actually functions better when it's statused than when it's not, thanks to Marvel Scale. Because Rest sleep activates Marvel Scale, its Defense skyrockets to match its high Special Defense, letting it actually set up on stuff without set up moves of their own like Sandslash, Uxie, Lanturn, Tangrowth w/o Leech Seed, Lilligant, Entei and a whole slew of other stuff. With the opponent's Steel-types gone there's very few Pok&eacute;mon that can tank a +2 or more Outrage, except for butts like Tangrowth.</p>

<p>Though when Dragonair is awake it's pretty prone to getting taken out by strong priority like Entei's ExtremeSpeed and Absol's Sucker Punch, so if possible I try to sweep or wallbreak while Dragonair's sleeping from Rest. </p>

<p>The major downside to this bad boy is its utter susceptibility to getting ruined by critical hits. If possible I try to not have Dragonair be my last Pok&eacute;mon just for that reason, since there have been times when I tried to create a win condition situation with Dragonair as my last mon and then getting crit. ;-;</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/641.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4>The Beast</h4>
<p><strong>Fraxure</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Trait: Mold Breaker<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 252 Spd / 4 HP<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Low Kick<br />
- Taunt</p>

<p>The complete muscle. Rarely does Fraxure have to get beyond +1 to secure a sweep against the opponent even with Jolly and Eviolite as the item. Eviolite is needed so that Fraxure can tank random attacks as it sets up, otherwise its just completely demolished by medium-level attacks like LO Sigilyph and Fighting-types. Taunt lets Fraxure set up on Pok&eacute;mon like Slowking, Mandibuzz, Alomomola, and a few other Pok&eacute;mon and then blow them away with Outrage. Low Kick lets Fraxure blast through Steelix and Aggron, and it also gives him a tool to use against weakened opponents so that he doesn't have to lock himself into Outrage or Outrage too early and risk getting confused.</p>

<p>In an ideal situation I will have weakened the opponent enough with Dragonair to just come in and use Outrage without even having to set up, but usually it isn't too hard to get the DD in.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<div class="float-right"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue29/ru_spotlight_rmt.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>While really being only popular in OU because of Magnezone, the "DragMag" playstyle is thus nearly nonexistent in lower metagames. However, Magnezone's pre-evolution, Magneton, exists as a solid RU Pok&eacute;mon, and Oglemi resurrects the playstyle by using it in tandem with forgotten NU Dragons. The strategy works so well because Magneton can remove almost every relevant Steel-type in RU, and Dragon-types excel at beating common Fire / Water / Grass cores. The two Dragons on this team are quite unique. The first is Fraxure, whose Attack stat rivals that of Druddigon's; the major difference and advantage is that Fraxure learns the renowned Dragon-type move: Dragon Dance. Fraxure's formidable wallbreaking abilities allow the next Dragon, the forgotten Dragonair, to sweep the rest of the opponent's team. The remaining members of Oglemi's team are all strategically placed to support its Dragons. Despite hail being so common at the time this team was made, Oglemi's DragMag still managed to succeed due to the great synergy between its teammates.</p>

<h3>The Team</h3>

<p>Aside from Magneton, the number one supportive option that Dragon-types desire is entry hazards. The team almost always uses Crustle as the lead, as it has no trouble setting up Stealth Rock and at least one layer of Spikes thanks to Sturdy and Custap Berry. Hazards are a crucial part of this team, as they allow Fraxure and Dragonair to attain more KOs and clean up late-game. Even if Magneton faints before taking out a Steel-type, hazards might wear something like Escavalier down to the point where Fraxure can KO with Outrage. As Dragon-types are generally difficult to switch into in RU, the damage from entry hazards adds up more quickly as the opponent is forced to switch more and fumbles to find an answer to Fraxure or Dragonair. Besides providing invaluable hazards, Crustle also benefits the team as a weapon against hail. With Rock Blast, it can bypass Snover's Focus Sash and beat SubProtect users. Crustle plays a critical role in giving its team momentum early-game and pressuring the opponent.</p>

<p>Rotom plays so many roles in this team that it's hard to believe it can survive throughout the match. However, with Volt Switch, Rotom can act as a pivot and easily escape from trouble as well as provide the team with instant momentum. Almost every RU team needs some sort of backup plan or alternate win condition, which usually means a fast Choice Scarf user that can sweep the opponent's team after the main sweeper has gone down. Rotom does exactly that, as its unique base 91 Speed lets it outspeed much of the tier, even the most common Choice Scarf user, Rotom-C. Combined with entry hazards, Rotom makes for a great late-game cleaner and revenge killer after the Dragons have weakened the opponent's team. More importantly, Rotom is the team's spinblocker, protecting the hazards that Crustle lays down. Without Rotom, this team would have a much more difficult time achieving its goal if the opponent could spin away Stealth Rock and Spikes. It's one of the only spinblockers that can reliably deal with Kabutops since Thunderbolt OHKOes, and Rotom also does a good job at crippling Cryogonal with Trick. Trick also serves as a backup to deal with threats such as Quagsire and Tangrowth to limit their attacking options. Aside from that, Rotom is the team's best answer to Fighting-types, so keeping it alive is absolutely crucial until these threats are eliminated. Luckily, the task becomes somewhat easier thanks to Volt Switch and its synergy with the rest of the team.</p>

<p>What really makes up the strategy of this team is&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;Magneton. Oglemi puts Magneton's best traits to use with the lesser-seen Choice Specs set: Speed and power. Magneton can outspeed most of the Steel-types in RU (Escavalier, Aggron, Steelix, and opposing Magneton due to the Timid nature). The remaining two Steel-types are Klinklang, who is straight up walled by Magneton, and Durant, who loses unless it has Superpower, in which case Rotom counters it. With Steels out of the way, Fraxure and Dragonair are free to wreak havoc. What's commonly overlooked is that Magneton has the third highest Special Attack in RU. With a Choice Specs set, Magneton is able to 2HKO most of the tier with the right move, including bulky Pok&eacute;mon that might give the Dragons trouble. Uxie, Spiritomb, and Tangrowth are among the threats it can wear down. With its great resistances and being part of the dual Volt Switch core with Rotom, Magneton is an irreplaceable member of the team.</p>

<p>Named as "the glue" of the team, Kabutops really does hold it together with its resistances, ability to sweep, priority, and of course Rapid Spin. As Fraxure is somewhat frail and Dragonair doesn't want to take too much damage early in the match, Kabutops is the team's primary answer to Fire-type threats such as Entei and Emboar, who will usually come in to revenge kill Magneton. Priority is almost a necessity in RU, as there are tons of fast, frail Pok&eacute;mon that can sweep your team if unprepared. Aqua Jet picks off things like Moltres, Cinccino, and Galvantula. Being the best spinner in RU, Kabutops is extremely beneficial to the team, as keeping hazards off the field will help the Dragon-types take more hits, allowing them to set up more often. If spinning isn't needed, Kabutops can just set up a Swords Dance and further break the opponent's walls or even proceed to sweep.</p>

<p>The final slots on the team are the two Dragon-types. Dragonair is certainly surprising to see, as most people think it would be outclassed by Druddigon. Oglemi takes advantage of Dragon Dance not in an offensive way, but a defensive one. Despite its low stats, Dragonair is in fact bulker than Druddigon with Eviolite. This allows it to set up easily on Pok&eacute;mon found in common Fire / Water / Grass cores, such as Typhlosion, Magmortar, Slowking, Alomomola, Rotom-C, and Amoonguss. Fire / Water / Grass cores are extremely popular and effective in the current metagame, so Dragonair can be considered an anti-metagame threat. Dragonair also acts as a sleep absorber with Sleep Talk, allowing it to set up on most Grass-types in the tier. It can also set up on some physical attackers more easily when asleep due to Marvel Scale, which boosts its physical defense when Dragonair is afflicted by a status condition. As you can see, it is very simple for Dragonair to get a setup opportunity, and it can often sweep entire teams without a problem. The best weapon against Dragonair is, unfortunately, critical hits. Fraxure is the final piece to the DragMag and dual Dragon combos. It reaches insane power even after just a single Dragon Dance. Every Pok&eacute;mon in RU, except for Steel-types (who should already be out of the way thanks to Magneton), gets 2HKOed by Outrage after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Fraxure's superb wallbreaking capabilities combined with hazards, Magneton, and Dragonair will just purely overwhelm the opponent. In most games, if Dragonair can't sweep, Fraxure will, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>The teamwork displayed here is incredible. Crustle sets up hazards early-game, which benefits each and every team member, Rotom and Magneton form a dual Volt Switch core to wear down the opponent and take out Steel-types, and Kabutops provides great utility by ridding the field of hazards and further denting walls&mdash;this all leads up to either of the two Dragon-types being able to overcome what's left of the opponent's team and sweep. The most replaceable member of this team is probably Fraxure. Druddigon can be a substitute as it too hits hard and has a bit more bulk behind it, which would help against certain threats like Hitmonlee and Tauros. Nevertheless, the team is able to show off an excellent display of offensive power.</p>

<h3>Threats</h3>

<p>Of course, no strategy is perfect. Though this is a heavy offense team, opposing heavy offense can do a number on it. Fighting-types and fast Normal-types in particular can ruin the team's strategy, as it only has Rotom to deal with them. Gallade especially is a threat as it can KO Rotom with Shadow Sneak so another Fighting-type teammate like Hitmonlee can sweep. Offensive BlizzSpam as well can be used to overwhelm Magneton and Kabutops and clean up the rest of the team. A Choice Specs Ice-type can 2HKO both of the team's Ice resists, and a Choice Scarf Blizzard user can follow up and KO the remaining teammates. As for defensive struggles, Quagsire is troublesome. Rotom will usually be forced to Trick it so it can be worn down, and even if successful, Rotom's sweeping and revenge killing abilities will be gone. Lanturn with Ice Beam and Tangrowth wall a lot of the team's Pok&eacute;mon, and thus require some extra time to defeat through good play.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Daenerys Storm demonstrates a playstyle that hasn't really been seen in RU yet. It has some unique and creative sets that are proven to be effective in this metagame. Aside from being a very solid team, it's also really fun to use, as although it requires some thought in order to win, a sweep with Dragonair or Fraxure feels really rewarding. Oglemi has successfully executed a devastating OU strategy in RU, and I can definitely see it becoming more popular after the showing of this team.</p>
