<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Almost everyone has experienced a moment in time when entry hazards have cost them the match. One minute, you have potent sweepers at full HP, ready to demolish the adversary. The next minute, you find yourself at the mercy to one of the forms of entry hazards, preventing you from switching into your all-star. Other times, you might even feel remorse about your team building, thinking, "Why have I not planned a tactic to deal with entry hazards?" However, some of us are so new to the competitive environment that we can't even comprehend what entry hazards are, let alone know how to handle them.</p>

<p>Entry hazards are long-term effects on the battlefield that affects any Pokemon switching into the field. There are three types of entry hazards: Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, each of them wielding a unique trait. Entry hazards have shaped our metagame so greatly that we have made several strategies on how to prevent them, such as spinning, which led to spinblocking to keep them there. The NU metagame is crawling with entry hazard users, such as Scolipede, Golem, and Roselia. If you can recognize a Pokemon that might attempt to shower you in entry hazards, you will have a much easier time preventing hazards from being set or removing them from play.</p>

<p>This guide will inform you about the three types of entry hazards in detail as well as the methods to prevent or remove them, including the list of Pokemon that can aid you in doing so. This guide will also inform you of the common NU Pokemon that you must watch out for pertaining to entry hazards, as well as a few tactics the opponent might use to keep entry hazards on the field. Finally, you will learn what to do if you are unable to prevent entry hazards from reaching your side of the field. You should feel pretty confident: you have taken your first step on how to become a master tamer of entry hazards in NU!</p>

<h2>Entry Hazards</h2>

<p>There are three different kinds of entry hazards: Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. Each of them has a certain purpose, and understanding that purpose really helps in knowing how to deal with them. One thing you might want to know about entry hazards is that they make you reconsider how often you wish to switch in and out. From passive damage to crippling statuses, the last thing you want for your sweeper is for it to be weakened, especially when you need it most! Some forms of entry hazards allow you to place them in layers, adding even more pressure to the ones who receive them. Let's take an in-depth look into each form of entry hazards.</p>

<h3>Stealth Rock</h3>

<p>Stealth Rock is the most popular entry hazard in the NU metagame. It can inflict damage on nearly every Pokemon that switches in and seriously harm some of NU's most dangerous threats, including Jynx, Scolipede, and Charizard.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock only requires one layer to have its full effect, making it the easiest and most efficient entry hazard to set up, especially for hyper offensive and offensive teams where residual damage can make the difference between an OHKO and a 2HKO. The damage it inflicts depends on the typing of the opponent; Stealth Rock is a Rock-type move, so the passive damage taken will reflect whether the Pokemon's typing is neutral, resistant, or weak to Rock-type moves.</p>

<ul>
<li>If a Pokemon has a 4x resistant to Rock, it only takes 1/32 (3.125%) damage.</li>
<li>If a Pokemon has a 2x resistance to Rock, such as a Sawk, it only takes 1/16 (6.25%) damage.</li>
<li>If a Pokemon is neutral to Rock, such as a Normal-type, it takes 1/8 (12.5%) damage.</li>
<li>If a Pokemon has a 2x weakness to Rock, such as Flying-, Fire-, and Bug-types, take 1/4 (25%) damage.</li>
<li>If a Pokemon suffers a 4x weakness to Rock-types, such as Butterfree, it takes 1/2 (50%) damage from Stealth Rock.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing these damage calculations helps in knowing which Pokemon on your team are safe to switch in. You might as well get to know Stealth Rock well, because almost every team has it, which is understandable. Its ability to inflict damage on nearly every Pokemon can really help in the long run. Sure, losing 1/8 of your HP doesn't seem like a big deal, but you will learn quickly that it adds up, slowly, yet steadily. Stealth Rock has been one of the biggest metagame-changers to date, and all the evidence backs this up.</p>

<h3>Spikes</h3>

<p>Spikes is the oldest of the entry hazards, and while it hasn't achieved as big an impact as Stealth Rock on the metagame, Spikes has definitely made its mark in the NU tier. For a while, Spikes wasn't used much, but with the grand arrival of Scolipede and Roselia, its usage sky-rocketed. One huge pro for Spikes is that they allow a variety of offensive threats to wear down Pokemon much more efficiently and push them close to KO range. In this offensive metagame, this is very relevant because most frail, offensive threats don't like the risk of missing out on KOs and taking a lot of damage in retaliation. Defensive teams in particular enjoy having Spikes in their arsenal, as they not only have the bulk to lay multiple layers on the field but also really appreciate its steady help in crippling the opponent. It is the most difficult entry hazard to fully lay out, as it has three layers, but it can inflict the most damage to the opponent. Spikes is a Ground-type move, so any Pokemon that isn't a Flying-type, doesn't Levitate, and doesn't have access to Magic Guard will be affected by Spikes. Unlike Stealth Rock, unless a Pokemon is flat-out immune to Spikes, it will take a specific amount of damage, regardless of the typing.</p>

<ul>
<li>If one layer of Spikes are down, the opponent takes 1/8 (12.5%) damage.</li>
<li>If two layers are laid down, the opponent takes 1/6 (16.67%) damage.</li>
<li>If all three layers are successfully laid, the opponent takes 1/4 (25%) damage.</li>
</ul>

<p>While it might be tricky to set up all three layers of Spikes, it is well worth the hassle. Who doesn't love having their opponent's Pokemon lose 25% of its HP with every switch? You mostly find Spikes on balanced and stall teams, where the adversary wants to rack up as much passive damage as possible. Despite that, Spikes can also be commonly seen on offensive teams with suicide Spikes users, such as Scolipede. While Spikes might not have made as big an impact on the metagame as Stealth Rock has, it's just as dangerous, so don't underestimate Spikes—not even for a second.</p>

<h3>Toxic Spikes</h3>

<p>Toxic Spikes is the least used entry hazard in the NU tier, and for good reason. Not many Pokemon in NU wield Toxic Spikes as an entry hazard move. Also, as Toxic Spikes is absorbed by Poison-type Pokemon, the oh-so-common Garbodor can easily remove Toxic Spikes from the field, wasting the efforts you contributed to laying them. However, with Roselia and Scolipede entering the NU tier, Toxic Spikes has had a significant increase in usage, so players have had to adjust to the change. It is extremely useful against teams that lack a Poison-type, as even a single layer can stall out offensive teams much easier, especially when the damage combines with Life Orb recoil. Defensive teams also dislike Toxic Spikes, but most tend to carry Poison-types.</p>

<p>One thing you should know about Toxic Spikes is that, unlike the former two entry hazards, it doesn't cause direct damage to the adversary; instead, it inflicts status on them!</p>

<ul>
<li>Toxic Spikes come in two layers: One layer on the field inflicts the poison status on anyone that isn't affected by another status already or immune to it, causing the Pokemon to lose 12.5% of its HP every turn.</li>
<li>When two layers of Toxic Spikes are in play, the opponent is badly poisoned, or Toxiced, resulting in accumulative damage to the Pokemon. When badly poisoned, the afflicted Pokemon will first lose 6.25% of their HP. However, with every passing turn, that number is increased by 6.25%. So, on the following turn, the Pokemon will lose 12.5%, on turn three, it will lose 18.75%, and so on. This cumulative effect will cease when the Pokemon switches out. When it comes back onto the field, it will start over at 6.25% and adds on from there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this, Toxic Spikes is most commonly used on stall teams, as their goal is to slowly cripple the opponent. Walls, such as Alomomola, and setup sweepers, such as Jynx, will think twice before switching in with Toxic Spikes on the field. You often see more defensive Pokemon utilizing this move more than anything else. Toxic Spikes can really turn a game around if used properly, so don't fall victim to its effects.</p>

<h2>How Can I Prevent or Remove Entry Hazards?</h2>

<p>You are sick and tired of having your prized Pokemon affected by entry hazards, and you want a stop to it. Maybe your Coil Serperior wasn't anticipating a Toxic Spikes, and now it can't set up due to its dwindling HP. What are you to do? Nothing to fear: There are many ways to prevent or avoid entry hazards; from using Rapid Spin to Magic Bounce, there are a plethora of options for you to select from that fits your style and situation. Here are the main—and most effective—ways to deal with entry hazards.</p>

<h3>Rapid Spin</h3>

<p>Rapid Spin is a Normal-type physical attack that, if it successfully makes contact with the opponent, will remove any entry hazards that have been laid on your side of the field. This method is one of the easier ways to remove entry hazards; however, because of the lack of good Rapid Spin users in the NU tier, it can be easily predicted and acted upon. It's a very popular move relating to entry hazards because there isn't much prediction or strategy to it; it's as simple as successfully landing the move on the opponent. However, bear in mind that unless you are using a stall-based team, Rapid Spin is not required, and offensive pressure (which will be thoroughly explained later on) is usually the best way to keep entry hazards off the field.</p>

<p>If you plan on using Rapid Spin as your method to removing entry hazards, there is one thing you should keep in mind. Rapid Spin must successfully hit the opponent for the entry hazards to be removed. Therefore, if you use the move against Ghost-types, it will not be effective because they are immune to Normal-type attacks. This is called spinblocking and will be explained thoroughly near the end. Let's take a closer look at the Rapid Spin users in NU that might help your team remove entry hazards.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/wartortle.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/wartortle"><strong>Wartortle</strong></a><br />
Typing: Water<br />
Base Stats: 59 HP / 63 Atk / 80 Def / 65 SpA / 80 SpD / 58 Spe <br />
Abilities: Torrent / Rain Dish</p>

<p>Firstly, we have Wartortle, who is a defensive Rapid Spin user. With Eviolite, Wartortle's defenses blast through the roof. While Wartortle doesn't have any way to outspeed or outright KO Ghost-types, it does have a very useful niche: Foresight. It might look pathetic at first glance, but with Foresight, Wartortle can hit Ghost-types with Rapid Spin, and when that niche is paired with its stellar defenses, it can nearly guarantee a Rapid Spin. It also has access to a great support move in Haze to take on sweepers that try to set up on Wartortle. However, that sums up Wartortle's usefulness; there aren't any other reasons to use it. Wartortle's offenses aren't very good. Because of this, it must resort to Eviolite to make its defenses stand out, so that eliminates the possibility of it using Leftovers. Wartortle works really well on stall teams because the flaws that Wartortle has (lack of recovery, vulnerability to status) are covered by typical moves found on stall teams (Wish, Heal Bell). Even with such great defenses, Wartortle's biggest drawback is its lack of recovery; it can be worn out with repeated attacks. If you want a defensively oriented Rapid Spin user, you should turn to Wartortle.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/torkoal.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/Torkoal"><strong>Torkoal</strong></a><br />
Typing: Fire<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 85 Atk / 140 Def / 85 SpA / 70 SpD / 20 Spe <br />
Abilities: White Smoke / Shell Armor </p>

<p>Next, we have Torkoal, who can play the role of both an offensive and supportive Rapid Spin user. Its Defense is what stands out most, and its decent bulk follows. Because of that high Defense, Torkoal finds many chances to switch into physical attacks and use Rapid Spin. Torkoal's access to support moves, such as Stealth Rock, allow Torkoal to act as a defensive spinner for its team. In addition, Shell Smash grants opportunities to take a more offensive approach with Torkoal. With Shell Smash, Torkoal outspeeds every Ghost-type Pokemon in NU, bar Haunter, who cannot survive powerful attacks from the get-go. However, specially offensive Pokemon can handle it quite well, as it is one of the slowest Pokemon in the tier without Shell Smash, and its bad defensive typing doesn't help. Overall, if you'd like a Pokemon who has good support moves and potential as a offensive threat, Torkoal is the right Pokemon for you.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/armaldo.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/armaldo"><strong>Armaldo</strong></a><br />
Typing: Rock / Bug<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 125 Atk / 100 Def / 70 SpA / 80 SpD / 45 Spe <br />
Abilities: Battle Armor / Swift Swim</p>

<p>Armaldo is one of the worst Rapid Spin users in the tier, unfortunately. All of the spinblockers can either cripple it with status or severely dent it before it can do a thing due to its saddening Speed. Because it usually invests in Attack and Speed, Armaldo's bulk isn't enough to tank a strong hit, which makes its spinning days short-lived. Its Stealth Rock weakness also cripples it further, and because of its lack of offensive presence, it is often forced out, causing it to take even more entry hazard damage. Even the defensive set is horrid, as Armaldo has very few resistances and many weaknesses to exploit. The only place where Armaldo belongs is on a rain team, where it can take advantage of its ability, Swift Swim, to not only get a quick Rapid Spin but also potentially set up Swords Dance to attempt a sweep. Armaldo should only be used on a need basis, as its cons severely outweigh the pros of using it.</p>

<h3>Taunt</h3>

<p>While this tactic requires a bit of prediction, it is still proven to work successfully. Taunt prevents any status moves from being used for three turns. That might not seem like much, but it has the potential to force the adversary to switch out, which gains momentum for your side. If you know the opponent's moveset, you might also skillfully predict an attack that a teammate can absorb, which also maintains momentum. Also, unlike Rapid Spin, Taunt can be used on all Pokemon. However, because of the three turn limit, your chance to make a move on your opponent is limited. Overall, Taunt is an effective way to prevent entry hazards from being laid on your side. Let's take a look at some of the Pokemon in NU that use Taunt effectively.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/skuntank.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/skuntank"><strong>Skuntank</strong></a><br />
Typing: Poison / Dark<br />
Base Stats: 103 HP / 93 Atk / 67 Def / 71 SpA / 61 SpD / 84 Spe <br />
Abilities: Stench / Aftermath / Keen Eye</p>

<p>Skuntank has many unique traits that make it stand out from the competition. Its access to both Sucker Punch and Pursuit makes it the perfect Pokemon to deal with Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, the former being very popular in the NU tier. Its quirky typing also grants it some handy resistances, which allows it to fare well against many Pokemon. Skuntank can be used on both offensive and defensive teams, as its ability to shut down setup Pokemon with Taunt is adored by both. Its ability, Aftermath, is a great last resort tactic against weakened threats. With all the entry hazard setters, notably Roselia and Garbodor, roaming the tier, it's up to Skuntank to reliably silence them. Unfortunately, Skuntank can only deal with the entry hazard setters mentioned above, as its Speed prevents it from silencing much else. In addition, Skuntank isn't the ideal Taunt user against common Stealth Rock users, as they can deal with it with little difficulty. Skuntank's Poison typing can also absorb Toxic Spikes, so the likes of Garbodor would have to think twice before attempting to set it down. While Skuntank doesn't have anything that significantly distinguishes it, it's still a fine Taunt user if its strengths are taken advantage of.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/mandibuzz.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/mandibuzz"><strong>Mandibuzz</strong></a><br />
Typing: Dark / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 110 HP / 65 Atk / 105 Def / 55 SpA / 95 SpD / 80 Spe <br />
Abilities: Big Pecks / Overcoat / Weak Armor </p>

<p>Mandibuzz has recently begun calling NU its home, and it has promising features that will not disappoint; stand aside, Murkrow! Firstly, it has great bulk, which allows it to tank anything from a Choice Band Sawk's Stone Edge to a Choice Specs Rotom-S's Thunderbolt. A weakness to Stealth Rock might be a deal breaker, but do not fear: Mandibuzz also has access to Roost, and when paired with its great defenses, Mandibuzz will usually find time to recover. While it doesn't wield the best abilities, it makes up for this with a variety of support moves, most notably Taunt, Toxic, and Whirlwind. Like Skuntank, Mandibuzz can only truly stop Roselia and Garbodor from laying entry hazards, as its Speed holds it back. Mandibuzz's Flying typing also makes it match-up poorly against common Stealth Rock users. Compared to other Taunt users, its Speed might not be loved, but its ability to tank many attacks while slowly weakening the opponent is what makes Mandibuzz a great Taunt user, as it has many chances to utilize it.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/misdreavus.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/misdreavus"><strong>Misdreavus</strong></a><br />
Typing: Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 60 Atk / 60 Def / 85 SpA / 85 SpD / 85 Spe <br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Misdreavus's great bulk with Eviolite and typing allow it to not only tank several hits from entry hazard users but also shut them down with Taunt. Misdreavus has the advantage of being a spinblocker and a user of Taunt, which makes it easier to shut down entry hazard users and prevent them from being removed from its opponent's side of the field. While its Speed isn't stellar, it can naturally outpace the majority of entry hazard users, making it easy to silence them. With support moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Heal Bell at its command, Misdreavus has many tools to take advantage of in many situations. All in all, Misdreavus is a great Pokemon to use with Taunt, as it will generally get the job done.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/samurott.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/samurott"><strong>Samurott</strong></a><br />
Typing: Water<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 100 Atk / 85 Def / 108 SpA / 70 SpD / 70 Spe <br />
Abilities: Torrent / Shell Armor </p>

<p>Though Samurott is more commonly used as a sweeper, it can also take the path of a Taunt user. Samurott is the ideal Taunt user for preventing Stealth Rock, as it fares well against all the common users in the tier thanks to its Water typing. While its Speed prevents it from using Taunt against the likes of Scolipede and offensive Garbodor, Samurott's large pool of coverage moves and great bulk enable it to survive a variety of situations, and it can even function as a anti-lead against opposing teams longing for entry hazards on your side.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/serperior.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/serperior"><strong>Serperior</strong></a><br />
Typing: Grass<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 75 Atk / 95 Def / 75 SpA / 95 SpD / 113 Spe <br />
Abilities: Overgrow</p>

<p>Speed is one of the essential traits a Taunt user needs to silence its prey, and Serperior has it. With an amazing base Speed, Serperior finds itself outspeeding the vast majority of the tier, making it a prime Taunt user. Its good bulk and great support options are also what make it so desirable to stop entry hazard setters. Serperior's decent offensive stats and powerful STAB moves allow it to take care of itself on the field. Serperior is the go-to Taunt user against Stealth Rock users, but because of its bad match-up against Spikes users, such as Roselia, Scolipede, and Garbodor, it doesn't do well against them. While quite a few Flying-types, such as Mandibuzz and Braviary, tend to rain on Serperior's parade by completely walling it, Serperior will not disappoint in its role of preventing entry hazards from being set on its side of the field.</p>

<h3>Magic Bounce</h3>

<p>Magic Bounce is a rare option to deal with entry hazards in NU because only one Pokemon wields the ability. With Magic Bounce, most status moves that are used against the Pokemon are bounced back, making this an excellent way to not only block entry hazards but to also place them on the opposing side. Although it requires a bit of prediction, if used correctly, it proves to be a great strategy.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/natu.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/natu"><strong>Natu</strong></a><br />
Typing: Psychic / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 40 HP / 50 Atk / 45 Def / 70 SpA / 45 SpD / 70 Spe <br />
Abilities: Synchronize / Early Bird / Magic Bounce</p>

<p>Natu's base stats aren't appealing; is there any reason to even use it? Yes, there is. Because of Magic Bounce, Natu can reflect any entry hazard that is used against it, though this requires a bit of prediction to take advantage of because the opponent will not attempt to set them if it is in play. Natu also cannot be hit by any status moves, so it can run Reflect without fear of being hit by Taunt or afflicted by status. While its bulk is initially horrific, with an Eviolite attached, it actually is decent enough to work with. It can even check Sawk because of its typing, and it can wall Golem and Regirock. Natu commonly runs a set consisting of Reflect / Roost / Toxic / Night Shade with a physically defensive EV spread. Its Speed allows it to outspeed nearly every other entry hazard user besides Scolipede, which grants it many chances to prevent them from setting up. There's more: Natu also is blessed with a recovery option in Roost, which allows it to last longer on the field. However, Natu is major setup bait, as it radiates little offensive presence besides Night Shade and Taunt. In addition, a lot of powerful attacks can score the KO on it.</p>

<h3>Offensive Pressure</h3>

<p>While this isn't a surefire method to prevent entry hazards from being set up, it can be very effective in the long run if used correctly. Offensive pressure is when you threaten the opponent with consistently powerful attacks to the point where the opponent rarely has a free turn, whether that would be to set up, switch, or counterattack. Obviously, offensive Pokemon are needed to accomplish this; when used correctly, they can not only prevent entry hazards from being laid on the field but also flip the outcome of the game. There are many Pokemon, such as Samurott and Ludicolo, that can utilize offensive pressure to their advantage, but let's look at a very common example of a Pokemon who utilizes it.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/sawk.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/sawk"><strong>Sawk</strong></a><br />
Typing: Fighting<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 125 Atk / 75 Def / 30 SpA / 75 SpD / 85 Spe <br />
Abilities: Sturdy / Inner Focus / Mold Breaker</p>

<p>Sawk is a Pokemon that has been known for keeping offensive pressure on the field. Its secret lies in its ability, Mold Breaker. With Mold Breaker, Sawk can bypass abilities that would otherwise hinder its attacks, such as Sturdy and Solid Rock. Because of this ability, Sawk can cleanly OHKO Carracosta and Golem, two Pokemon that would normally be difficult to take down because of their abilities. It can also deal with Scolipede, a common Spikes user in the tier. Its access to Mold Breaker its ability to prevent Sturdy Pokemon from always getting up Stealth Rock is one of Sawk's main advantages over Primeape. Not only that, but Sawk does very well against many of the Pokemon in NU as a whole, making it very desirable for many teams. All in all, Sawk is a great example of a Pokemon that can maintain offensive pressure to prevent the opponent from attempting any risky actions.</p>

Common Users of Entry Hazards to Watch Out For:

<p>Knowing the most common users of entry hazards in NU is just as important as learning how to deal with them. While there are many, many Pokemon in the tier that can utilize entry hazards, there are only a handful of them that you should definitely keep an eye out for, as these guys are the most dangerous. Here is the list of the most common entry hazard users in NU that you should watch out for.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/golem.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/golem"><strong>Golem</strong></a><br />
Typing: Rock / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 110 Atk / 130 Def / 55 SpA / 65 SpD / 45 Spe <br />
Abilities: Rock Head / Sturdy / Sand Veil<br />
Accessible Entry Hazard(s): Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Golem is a very versatile Pokemon, able to play roles ranging from Custap Berry to a defensive route. With a Rock / Ground typing, Golem can utilize its dual STAB moves to tackle a wide range of Pokemon, making it harder to defeat. It also wields Sturdy, an ability that really makes it challenging to stop it from laying Stealth Rock on the field and allows it to stand out from other Stealth Rock users. Its Attack and Defense stats aren't something to ignore, either.</p>

<p>Using Sawk against Golem is by far the best tactic; because Sawk has Mold Breaker, it can break through Golem's Sturdy for a KO, refusing to give it a chance to retaliate. Using Wartortle against Golem is a great choice as well; Golem has a 4x weakness to Water-type attacks, so it'll think twice about staying in with Wartortle around. Golem's pitiful Speed can also be targeted by Taunt users, stopping it from laying entry hazards. Aside from Water-types, Golem also suffers weakness to Grass- and Fighting-types. Finally, special attackers in general can severely dent Golem. Golem has many weaknesses to target, but it also has many tricks up its sleeve, so don't be fooled.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/scolipede.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/scolipede"><strong>Scolipede</strong></a><br />
Typing: Bug / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 90 Atk / 89 Def / 55 SpA / 69 SpD / 112 Spe <br />
Abilities: Poison Point / Swarm / Quick Feet<br />
Accessible Entry Hazard(s): Spikes, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Scolipede's Speed should catch your eye; it is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier. Outspeeding it without a boosting move or a Choice Scarf is really difficult, so it has a much easier time setting up entry hazards than some other threats. Additionally, with a plethora of powerful coverage moves and a decent base Attack, Scolipede can fight back when necessary. It even has Swords Dance, which makes it even more of an offensive threat, allowing it to scare away Pokemon that could otherwise threaten it while stacking up Spikes simultaneously.</p>

<p>Scolipede has pitiful defenses, so aiming at them is a wise move. All three of the viable Rapid Spin users fare pretty well against Scolipede, so using Rapid Spin won't be a hassle. Even if Taunt is used against Scolipede, it has powerful coverage moves to bring the pain, so trying to stop it this way isn't truly advised. Additionally, because Scolipede is faster than most of the Pokemon that try to Taunt it, it cannot truly be stopped by it. There isn't much to say about Scolipede; it has a straightforward niche and is a threat if you aren't ready for it, but if you are well-equipped to handle Scolipede, defeating it won't be a challenge.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/carracosta.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/carracosta"><strong>Carracosta</strong></a><br />
Typing: Water / Rock<br />
Base Stats: 74 HP / 108 Atk / 133 Def / 83 SpA / 65 SpD / 32 Spe <br />
Abilities: Solid Rock / Sturdy / Swift Swim<br />
Accessible Entry Hazard(s): Stealth Rock</p>

<p>You will quickly learn that Carracosta is one of the most difficult entry hazard users to get by. Firstly, it has two fantastic abilities: Sturdy and Solid Rock, both of which can nearly guarantee that Stealth Rock is placed on the field. Carracosta also sports threatening Attack and Defense stats; it can dent the majority of the tier with its STAB moves and tank hits. Additionally, Carracosta's Shell Smash set is very common, so it can bluff that and simply set up Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>To get past this guy, the best thing to do is to use a Grass-type, such as Tangela or Vileplume, as its 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks can be used against it. Mold Breaker Sawk and Taunt can easily stop Carracosta as well. Outspeeding Carracosta is also a great way to defeat it, as it has a saddening Speed stat. All in all, be cautious when dealing with Carracosta; preventing it from getting Stealth Rock is a very difficult task.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/garbodor.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/garbodor"><strong>Garbodor</strong></a><br />
Typing: Poison<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 95 Atk / 82 Def / 60 SpA / 82 SpD / 75 Spe <br />
Abilities: Stench / Weak Armor / Aftermath<br />
Accessible Entry Hazard(s): Spikes, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>In a tier lacking in Spikes and Toxic Spikes users, Garbodor has all the necessities needed to be successful. With many powerful Fighting-type Pokemon in NU, Garbodor's Poison typing is useful to stop them cold. 80 / 82 / 82 aren't that bad when it comes to defenses either. Garbodor also has access to Clear Smog, preventing all those setup Pokemon from taking advantage of it. Some of the main reasons to use Garbodor are its superior physical defense in comparison to other Spikers, Aftermath, and lack of a Stealth Rock weakness.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, you will find that Garbodor can still be taken care of without too much difficulty. For one, the NU tier is crawling with powerful Psychic-type Pokemon, especially Gardevoir, Jynx, and Musharna, to rain on Garbodor's parade. Ground-types, such as Seismitoad and Golem, also find Garbodor easy prey. While Garbodor's Speed isn't god-awful, faster Taunt users can get the jump on it, preventing it from laying entry hazards. Armaldo can tank Garbodor's attacks and stop entry hazards from going on the field as well. Garbodor has its perks, but if you can exploit its weaknesses, you can take out the trash.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/regirock.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/regirock"><strong>Regirock</strong></a><br />
Typing: Rock<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 100 Atk / 200 Def / 50 SpA / 100 SpD / 50 Spe <br />
Abilities: Clear Body / Sturdy<br />
Accessible Entry Hazard(s): Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Regirock is a physically defensive behemoth; a base 200 Defense is something worth bragging about. It also has decent base Attack and Special Defense stats to bring more to the table. Regirock's astounding defenses, access to a recovery move in Drain Punch, and powerful STAB selections are what make it a blessing to have on your side and a curse to battle against.</p>

<p>The best way to handle Regirock is to weaken it with a special attacker, such as Gorebyss, Samurott, or Roselia. However, unless it is hit by Taunt or weakened beforehand, it is a very hard task to prevent Stealth Rock from invading your side of the field when Regirock is in play, so don't let your guard down for a moment.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/golurk.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/golurk"><strong>Golurk</strong></a><br />
Typing: Ground / Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 89 HP / 124 Atk / 80 Def / 55 SpA / 80 SpD / 55 Spe <br />
Abilities: Iron Fist / Klutz / No Guard<br />
Accessible Entry Hazard(s): Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Ever since Golurk stepped foot in the NU tier, it has been a pain to battle against. For one, it has many handy resistances and immunities, notably to Fighting-type attacks, with great bulk to back them up. It also has an amazing base Attack, making it no pushover. Iron Fist can really bring the pain to an unprepared team, and Golurk has many punching attacks to take full advantage of it. The thing that makes Golurk stand out is that it's the only Ghost-type Pokemon with Stealth Rock, allowing it to lay hazards and spinblock at the same time. Golurk doesn't have a bad match up against the Rapid Spin users if it comes in at the right time.</p>

<p>That being said, Golurk is by no means invincible and can be taken down with the right strategy. Golurk has weaknesses to the common Water-, Grass-, and Ice-type attacks, so powerful users of these can come in and score a KO. Because of its low Speed, Taunt users seem like a good idea to prevent Golurk from laying Stealth Rock. The thing about that is Golurk can either outright KO or wall all of the best users, bar Pursuit Skuntank, who can checkmate it. As you can see, Golurk is no easy Pokemon to get through, but don't let that discourage you from your goal of stopping it.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/seismitoad.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/seismitoad"><strong>Seismitoad</strong></a><br />
Typing: Water / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 105 HP / 85 Atk / 75 Def / 85 SpA / 75 SpD / 74 Spe <br />
Abilities: Swift Swim / Poison Touch / Water Absorb<br />
Accessible Entry Hazard(s): Stealth Rock</p>

<p>While Seismitoad seems to be outclassed by fellow Water-types, such as Samurott and Gorebyss, it has its own unique strategy that can quickly become a pain to deal with. Besides having great defenses and a good defensive typing, Seismitoad has access to Water Absorb, allowing it to be a great switch-in for teams that are weak against Water-types, such as Carracosta. Seismitoad also has Swift Swim, raising its average Speed to amazing heights, which makes it twice as easy to lay Stealth Rock on the field before its opponents can do a thing. Seismitoad is capable of running a defensive or offensive set, so by first glance, you won't know what it's going to do. What's even worse is that Seismitoad can deal with all three of the viable spinners with ease, and being hit by Taunt won't affect it that much, as it has many powerful attack moves to get rid of the opponent.</p>

<p>That being said, not all is lost when dealing with Seismitoad, as it actually has some pretty notable weaknesses. The first is its crippling 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks. If you carry a Roselia, Tangela, Serperior, or any relatively strong Grass-type, you won't have any troubles defeating Seismitoad. It's best to remove Stealth Rock from the field after Seismitoad is removed, as doing it while it's in play is quite difficult. While Taunt does bother Seismitoad temporarily, it can still severely dent the adversary with a Hydro Pump or Scald, so it's not advised to touch it while it's on the field. Make sure you play smart around Seismitoad; it has many strategies and tricks that could leave you with Stealth Rock intact on your side of the field.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/roselia.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/roselia"><strong>Roselia</strong></a><br />
Typing: Grass / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 60 Atk / 45 Def / 100 SpA / 80 SpD / 65 Spe <br />
Abilities: Natural Cure / Poison Point / Leaf Guard<br />
Accessible Entry Hazard(s): Spikes, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Roselia's debut in NU, along with Scolipede, has drastically increased the usage of Spikes and Toxic Spikes in the tier. What makes Roselia stand out is its access to Eviolite, raising its defenses to great heights. It also can use Synthesis, giving it a great recovery move to back up its defenses. Natural Cure is another fantastic trait that Roselia wields; it can switch out and have any status condition cured, making it difficult to cripple and turning Rest into a wonderful option for it to use. It's more than a fragile flower: it has a usable base Special Attack and powerful STAB moves to use. With all of these traits in mind, Roselia has many ways to ensure entry hazards are on the field, whether it be by force or stalling.</p>

<p>However, even with Eviolite, Roselia's Defense stat is still quite weak, so focusing on that is the best option for defeating it. Outspeeding Roselia can also be a tactic, as it has a mediocre Speed stat. Powerful special attackers, such as Gardevoir, Jynx, and Charizard, can still severely dent Roselia; Eviolite can only raise its defenses so far. Natu actually has some use: it can outspeed Roselia and reflect any entry hazards it lays. Poison-types, such as Garbodor, can absorb Toxic Spikes as well. All in all, Roselia is a pretty good entry hazard user that you should prepare for, as many of its talents can ensure at least one layer of entry hazards.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/gigalith.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/gigalith"><strong>Gigalith</strong></a><br />
Typing: Rock<br />
Base Stats: 85 HP / 135 Atk / 130 Def / 60 SpA / 70 SpD / 25 Spe <br />
Abilities: Sturdy / Sand Force<br />
Accessible Entry Hazard(s): Stealth Rock</p>

<p>The first things that probably stand out about Gigalith are its enormous Attack and Defense stats and its ability, Sturdy. If you combine these together, you create a Pokemon that is nearly guaranteed to set up Stealth Rock. With access to powerful and useful STAB moves, such as Stone Edge and Rock Blast, Gigalith can slip out of tricky situations. It also is effective at using the Custap Berry, which not only highlights its ability, Sturdy, but also allows it to go out with a bang when its mission is complete.</p>

<p>The easiest way to handle Gigalith is to target its saddening Special Defense. Ground-type Pokemon, such as Golurk and Golem, can take Gigalith's STAB moves pretty well and weaken it. Another way to defeat Gigalith is to use multi-hit moves to get around Sturdy. Also, because of its disastrous Speed stat, using Taunt before it can set up is an effective tactic as well. However, unless Gigalith takes damage prior to its debut on the field or one of these tactics is used, it will be challenging to stop it from laying Stealth Rock.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/piloswine.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/piloswine"><strong>Piloswine</strong></a><br />
Typing: Ice / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 100 Atk / 80 Def / 60 SpA / 60 SpD / 50 Spe <br />
Abilities: Oblivious / Snow Cloak / Thick Fat<br />
Accessible Entry Hazard(s): Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Piloswine finds a niche as an offensive entry hazard user. With a typing that hits almost every Pokemon hard and raised bulk with Eviolite, Piloswine makes for a great Stealth Rock user who can defeat nearly anyone who thinks otherwise. The bulk Piloswine possesses with Eviolite is what allows it to be so effective with Stealth Rock; it can set up on many offensive Pokemon in the tier.</p>

<p>Ironically enough, Piloswine is actually weak to all forms of entry hazards, so you can use that against it. Knock Off, while not always the best move overall, can remove Eviolite and make Piloswine less threatening, so using a Pokemon who has that is recommended. Taunt users can easily Taunt Piloswine because of its Speed, but be wary of its powerful attacks and priority with Ice Shard. Wartortle in particular fares extremely well against Piloswine, tanking all of the attacks it can offer. Piloswine isn't common, so don't make an entire team revolving around defeating it, but underestimate it at your own risk.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/cacturne.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/cacturne"><strong>Cacturne</strong></a><br />
Typing: Grass / Dark<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 115 Atk / 60 Def / 115 SpA / 60 SpD / 55 Spe <br />
Abilities: Sand Veil / Water Absorb<br />
Accessible Entry Hazard(s): Spikes</p>

<p>While Cacturne isn't the most common Spikes user in the tier, it has gained more usage because of its access to the move. While it has mediocre defenses and poor Speed, Cacturne compensates for this with its amazing offensive presence. Sucker Punch ignores Cacturne's Speed, making it a useful move. Swords Dance enhances Cacturne's Attack, turning it into an even more threatening Pokemon.</p>

<p>However, believe it or not, Cacturne is pretty easy to beat with appropriate Pokemon, such as Vileplume, Braviary, and Sawk. Another advantage is that Armaldo and Torkoal have no difficulties defeating Cacturne, causing it to be at the mercy of two of the three viable Rapid Spin users. Honestly, don't stress about facing Cacturne, but don't underestimate its capabilities, as one slip up can earn its team a KO.</p>

<h2>Spinblocking</h2>

<p>Some teams, specifically defensive and stall teams, anticipate the adversary attempting to remove the entry hazards they have placed on the field with Rapid Spin. Spinblocking is a tactic that can prevent Rapid Spin from removing the entry hazards. Because Rapid Spin is a Normal-type attack, Ghost-type Pokemon are immune to it, allowing them to stop it from working. There aren't many good spinblockers in NU, but there are a few that stand out from the rest and should definitely stand out when you see them in battle. Knowing these Pokemon will have you prepared against their attempts to spinblock.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/misdreavus.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/misdreavus"><strong>Misdreavus</strong></a><br />
Typing: Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 60 Atk / 60 Def / 85 SpA / 85 SpD / 85 Spe <br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Misdreavus is unarguably one of the most common spinblockers in the tier, and it isn't difficult to see why. It has access to Eviolite; a plethora of support moves, such as Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Heal Bell; and viable offenses, all of which make it a formidable opponent. Because of these traits, Rapid Spin users have difficulties getting past Misdreavus. Generally, Misdreavus is one of the first spinblockers a battler would go to, as it can fit on a variety of teams. However, Misdreavus does have exploitable weak points you can take advantage of to remove it from play. It lacks a reliable healing move, so hitting hard with powerful attacks will slowly wear it down. Shell Smash Torkoal can power through Misdreavus, but if Misdreavus uses Taunt before it can set up, Torkoal fails to inflict a lot of damage onto it. Overall, be very careful&mdash;and prepared&mdash;when battling Misdreavus, as it is the most likely spinblocker to get in your way.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/golurk.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/golurk"><strong>Golurk</strong></a><br />
Typing: Ground / Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 89 HP / 124 Atk / 80 Def / 55 SpA / 80 SpD / 55 Spe <br />
Abilities: Iron Fist / Klutz / No Guard</p>

<p>Golurk's usable defenses and many immunities and resistances allow it to function as a great spinblocker. With Stealth Rock, Golurk is always ready to handle the adversary, crushing them with its high base Attack. It also can support the team well with Stealth Rock. While its common weaknesses and low Speed can be easily targeted by those wanting to get rid of it, Golurk has many tricks up its sleeve, giving opponents a real run for their money.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/haunter.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/haunter"><strong>Haunter</strong></a><br />
Typing: Ghost / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 45 HP / 50 Atk / 45 Def / 115 SpA / 55 SpD / 95 Spe <br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Haunter has many resistances and immunities to take advantage of, granting it many opportunities to switch in to spinblock. Haunter is an offensive spinblocker; while it's not reliable at spinblocking, it can use the free switch in from Rapid Spin to inflict serious damage. It has many useful support moves, including Taunt, Trick, and Disable, allowing it to silence the opposing team quite easily; its above average base Speed also helps make this possible. The problem is Haunter is extremely frail, so all three viable spinners can shut it down with brute force. Even with Substitute, Haunter just doesn't have the sheer bulk that, say, Golurk has to last long enough on the field, and many spinners trying to get rid of entry hazards can target that. While Haunter has its perks, you will find that it isn't that difficult to defeat, so don't stress over it.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/drifblim.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/drifblim"><strong>Drifblim</strong></a><br />
Typing: Ghost / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 150 HP / 80 Atk / 44 Def / 90 SpA / 54 SpD / 80 Spe <br />
Abilities: Aftermath / Unburden / Flare Boost</p>

<p>Drifblim has always been an odd Pokemon, and that is also true when it comes to its role as a spinblocker. While its HP is extremely high, its typing and defenses aren't so hot, so many offensive Pokemon can get the jump on it (hint hint). From Baton Pass to SubCM to Will-O-Wisp, Drifblim has many options and support moves in its arsenal, making it an unpredictable Pokemon. Another trait it possesses is handling spinners, especially Armaldo, quite well with Destiny Bond, which makes it a prime spinblocker. That being said, it's not very reliable at KOing Armaldo because if it switches into Armaldo's Rock-type STAB, it is dead. It is rather uncommon in the tier, but while it isn't quite that hard to KO, its unpredictability can be used against you, so be cautious.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/lampent.gif"  /><br />
<a href="/dex/bw/pokemon/lampent"><strong>Lampent</strong></a><br />
Typing: Ghost / Fire<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 40 Atk / 60 Def / 95 SpA / 60 SpD / 55 Spe <br />
Abilities: Flash Fire / Flame Body</p>

<p>A large quantity of support moves, increased bulk because of Eviolite, a great Special Attack, nearly perfect coverage with its STAB moves... and yet Lampent is still dwelling in the depths of NU usage. Well, for one, it needs a pretty good core that specifically revolves around it to work, as it is outclassed by many many Fire- and Ghost-types in terms of power and bulk. It also has many weaknesses, allowing many offensive Pokemon, and Armaldo and Wartortle, to defeat it. It can't just fit on any team, which is why it isn't as common as, say, Misdreavus. In spite of this, with many set options to choose from, it takes a bit of prediction to figure out what Lampent is going to do on the battlefield. In spite of not being common in the slightest, it can seize control of the match if used correctly.</p>

<h2>What if I'm Unable to Remove the Entry Hazards?</h2>

<p>If you have failed in preventing or removing entry hazards from your side of the field, there isn't much you can do about it, to be honest. The only thing you could try is avoiding switching as much as possible, but if you happen to be using a stall team, this is extremely difficult. Another 'solution' is using Pokemon that aren't weak to entry hazards, but unfortunately, in the NU tier, there aren't as many good Pokemon that can rise to that title as in other tiers. If you were expecting an elaborate explanation of what to do if you couldn't effectively prevent entry hazards from being permanently set up, you're out of luck; there isn't much you can truly do about it if you don't have any tactics to avoid this. To avoid this scenario, it's best if you remove or prevent the entry hazards before they become a problem for your team.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>At this point, you should have a clear understanding of how much entry hazards have impacted the NU tier as well as how to deal with them. While this guide cannot explain every scenario you might come across, hopefully it has given you some strategies you can utilize when entry hazards have your back against the wall. Or, maybe you have decided to ignore the tips I have given you and skip to the end of this guide. Well, that works for me as well as all of your future opponents. We can rack up a free win against you with entry hazards by our side.</p>
