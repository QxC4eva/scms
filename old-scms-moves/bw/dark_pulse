<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 20% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>One of the best special Dark moves available, with good Base Power, perfect accuracy, 20% chance to flinch, and great distribution. It's the main option for many specially inclined Dark-type Pokemon, and thanks to its great distribution is used as a coverage move on some other Pokemon as well. Note that if paired with a Fighting-type move, typically Focus Blast, it gains almost perfect neutral coverage, the combination only being resisted by Heracross and Toxicroak. In the last generation, it was most commonly used on mono-attacking Spiritomb's set since nothing is immune to Dark-type moves; however, it is currently a lesser option thanks to the newly introduced ability Justified, and more powerful Fighting-types. Another low point is that it lost its status as a TM move this generation, so its distribution is no longer as great as it once was. Still, it's worth using on a specially inclined Pokemon that either needs to remove Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Nasty Plot Lucario, or just needs a good STAB move to abuse, as with Zoroark.</p>
