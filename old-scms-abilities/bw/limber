<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder cannot be paralyzed. If the wielder is paralyzed, it is instantly cured of paralysis.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/moves/thunder_wave">Thunder Wave</a> has a wide distribution as a TM; as such, it's a very common move in the metagame. Limber prevents it from working and potentially ruining a sweep. It's a solid option for most Pokemon that have access to it; but is often overshadowed by options such as <a href="/bw/abilities/technician">Technician</a> (<a href="/bw/pokemon/persian">Persian</a>) and <a href="/bw/abilities/prankster">Prankster</a> (<a href="/bw/pokemon/liepard">Liepard</a>). <a href="/bw/pokemon/ditto">Ditto</a> has a much better option in <a href="/bw/abilities/imposter">Imposter</a>, and should always use that instead of Limber.</p>
