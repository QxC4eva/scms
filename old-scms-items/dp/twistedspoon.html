<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises the power of Psychic-type moves 20% when this item is held.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In battle, TwistedSpoon performs almost exactly like <a href="/dp/items/odd_incense">Odd Incense</a>. The only difference is how these items affect the Base Power of the move <a href="/dp/moves/fling">Fling</a>; Odd Incense makes Fling's Base Power 10 while TwistedSpoon makes it 30. Due to this, Odd Incense is marginally better (unless the Pokemon holding it uses Fling) because opponents employing the extremely rare Trick/Thief + Fling strategy will deal slightly less damage when they Fling your item. For information on the competitive use of this item, see the Odd Incense description.</p>
