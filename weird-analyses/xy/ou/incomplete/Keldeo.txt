Overview
########
The transition to XY was very unkind to Keldeo. The changed mechanics of Drizzle means that Keldeo can no longer take advantage of Rain as well as it could in the past generation, while the introduction of new threats such as Fairy-types and Talonflame make Keldeo's life much more miserable than it was in the past. To make matters worse, Keldeo also faces a large amount of competition with Greninja for a teamslot, as Greninja has greater Speed, a much better ability, and a greater movepool.

While these changes hinder Keldeo's performance in OU, it still has many traits that make it a great Pokemon in the tier. It has a great typing, both offensively and defensively, allowing Keldeo to hit a majority of the tier for neutral damage, while also giving it multiple opportunities to switch in. Keldeo's signature move, Secret Swords, allows it to bypass many special walls such as Blissey and Chansey, giving it a major niche over other special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y. Combined with its excellent base 129 Special Attack and base 108 Speed stats, this makes Keldeo a powerful sweeper and revenge killer, capable of devastating unprepared teams.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Secret Sword
move 3: Icy Wind
move 4: Hidden Power Flying / Scald
item: Choice Specs / Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SDef / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Keldeo's excellent speed, power, and coverage make it one of the premier wallbreakers of OU. Hydro Pump is Keldeo's main STAB move due to its high base power and excellent neutral coverage in the metagame. Secret Sword is Keldeo's secondary STAB attack, as it is not only reliable, but bypasses common specially defensive walls such as Blissey and has excellent coverage with Hydro Pump. Icy Wind hits Grass- and Dragon-types such as Whimsicott and Latias for super effective damage, while also lowering the opponent's Speed. Hidden Power Flying is used primarily to 2HKO Keldeo's best check, Mega Venusaur after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. However Scald can be used in its place as a more reliable Water-type STAB attack. Its 30% Burn chance is able to cripple many of Keldeo's common checks, such as Mega Venusaur, Azumarill, and Latias, making it an excellent option.

Set Details
========
A Timid nature is used to allow Keldeo to outspeed many important threats, such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Kyurem-B. The choice of item depends on your personal preference. If you prefer Keldeo to hit as hard as possible, then the Choice Specs is the recommended item choice. If you prefer Keldeo to have the freedom of switching moves, then the Life Orb is the recommended item choice. An Expert Belt can be used over both items, as it allows Keldeo to feign a Choice item. However, Expert Belt makes Keldeo significantly weaker than it would be if it is using a Choice Specs or Life Orb, making it the inferior item choice in most scenarios.

Usage Tips
========
Keldeo's high speed and powerful STAB attacks make it best used mid- to late-game, as it can easily sweep the foe's team once its checks and counters are weakened. Keldeo still works very well early-game, as well, as it can use its excellent coverage to enable another Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar or Scizor to sweep later in the game. Keldeo's excellent typing and decent bulk also makes it an great switch-in to Rock-, Fire-, and Steel-types, as it can OHKO a majority of these type of Pokemon with its powerful STAB attacks.

Team Options
========
Keldeo appreciates entry hazard support to weaken its checks and counters. Deoxys-D and Deoxys-S are excellent partners in this role. Rain support from Politoed or a manual Rain Dance setter such as Thundurus is also appreciated, as it increases the power of Keldeo's Water-type STAB attacks, making it much more difficult to defeat. If a manual Rain Dance setter or Politoed is not being used as a partner, then Heatran becomes a great partner, as it is able to check a majority of Keldeo's common checks and counters such as Mega Venusaur, Latios, Talonflame, and Trevenent. Electric-types such as Rotom-W, Mega Manetric, and Thundurus are also good partners, as they are able to defeat Water-types such as Slowbro, Tentacruel, and Jellicent, while also being able to provide momentum to Keldeo with Volt Switch. Scizor is also able to provide momentum to Keldeo with U-Turn, while also defeating common Fairy- and Dragon-type Pokemon that are able to check Keldeo. Aegislash and Tyranitar are also great partners, as both are able to defeat a large majority of Keldeo's common checks such as Latios and Celebi.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Secret Sword
move 3: Icy Wind
move 4: Surf / Hidden Power Electric
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SDef / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
With this set, Keldeo aims to function as reliable revenge killer, defeating many of its faster checks such as Deoxys-S. Hydro Pump is Keldeo's primary STAB move due to its high base power allowing Keldeo to OHKO Deoxys-S after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, as well as 2HKO relatively bulky Pokemon such as wallbreaker Aegislash. Secret Sword is Keldeo's secondary STAB move, hitting common special walls such as Blissey, Chansey, and Tyranitar for super effective damage. While Icy Wind has low base power, it is used primarily to revenge kill Pokemon such as Garchomp, Noivern, and Dragonite. Surf is used as Keldeo's alternative Water-type STAB attack, as its greater accuracy allows Keldeo to reliably revenge kill threats such as Terrakion and Deoxys-S. Hidden Power Electric is an option over Surf to hit Water-types that resist Keldeo's STAB attacks fairly hard, such as Azumarill and Gyarados.

Set Details
========
With a Timid nature and maximum Speed, Choice Scarf Keldeo is able to outspeed +2 Adamant Dragonite and anything slower. A Modest nature is a viable option over the Timid nature, giving Keldeo a greater amount of power and allowing it to function a secondary role as a sweeper. However, Keldeo is then unable to outspeed important Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Garchomp and Deoxys-S, making the Timid nature superior in most situations. Scald is an option over Surf for its greater Burn chance, although its lower base power means that Keldeo cannot reliably OHKO Terrakion, as well as a 2HKO Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock, and Specially Defensive Heatran.

Usage Tips
========
Choice Scarf Keldeo can generally function well in any point in the match, as its boosted speed and already excellent power allow it to function as both a reliable revenge killer and late-game sweeper. Due to Keldeo's excellent typing, it is able to check many common boosting sweepers, such as Swords Dance Scizor, Mega Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Lucario, as well as several common Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp, Tyranitar, and Landorus. While being able to revenge kill these Pokemon is an excellent trait, it should be noted that Keldeo is defeated by one of OU's best revenge killers, Talonflame, as Talonflame is able to OHKO Keldeo before it has a chance to do anything with its priority Brave Bird.

Team Options
========
Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Deoxys-S and Deoxys-D is greatly appreciated, as it allows Keldeo to take advantage of the large amount of switches it forces, while also making it easier for Keldeo to achieve important OHKOes and 2HKOes. Scizor is a great partner, as it are able to check many of Keldeo's common counters, while also providing momentum with U-Turn. Electric-types such as Thundurus and Rotom-W are also able to provide momentum to Keldeo while also checking Water- and Flying types by virtue of their typing. Heatran is also an excellent partner, as it is able to check common Grass-, Fairy-, Flying-, and Dragon-types that are able to defeat Keldeo with little to no effort. Politoed is a great partner as well, as it is able to increase the power of Keldeo's Surf and Hydro Pump with its Drizzle ability. Finally, Aegislash and Tyranitar are able to defeat a large majority of Keldeo's counters, making them excellent partners.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 3: Secret Sword
move 4: Hidden Power Ghost / Icy Wind
item: Life Orb / Lum Berry
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
With Calm Mind, Keldeo uses its fairly unique typing, power, and good natural bulk to try to set up and sweep the opposing team. Hydro Pump is Keldeo's recommended Water-type STAB move due to its high Base power, allowing Keldeo to OHKO offensive Aegislash after one round of Life Orb recoil. Despite Hydro Pump's excellent base power, Scald can be used in Hydro Pump's place as a more reliable STAB attack, as the Special Attack boost makes up for its lower base power. It also has a 30% burn chance, which is able to cripple many of Keldeo's counters such as Latias, Azumarill, and Mega Venusaur, as well as increase Keldeo's setup opportunities. Secret Swords is Keldeo's secondary STAB move, receiving great coverage with Keldeo's Water-type STAB attacks and hitting special walls such as Chansey and Blissey for super effective damage. Hidden Power Flying hits many of Keldeo's common checks, such as Trevenent, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi, for super effective damage and receives perfect neutral coverage with Secret Sword. Despite this, Substitute can be used in its place, as it protects Keldeo from status moves and revenge killers, which can be beneficial in many scenarios. Hidden Power Ghost and Icy Wind are alternate coverage moves that Keldeo can utilize to defeat various threats such as Starmie and Dragonite, respectively.

Set Details
========
Keldeo takes a more offensive approach to utilizing Calm Mind, making the Life Orb the preferred item option to increase Keldeo's power. However, Leftovers can be used to increase Keldeo's longevity, making it easier for it to setup multiple Calm Minds, and is mandatory if using Substitute. Alternative items Keldeo can use include Lum Berry and Coba Berry. Lum Berry can be used if you prefer Keldeo to avoid taking damage from status moves, but this is somewhat redundant with Substitute. Coba Berry allows Keldeo to take moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack much better, but again, this is relatively redundant with Substitute.

Usage Tips
========
Keldeo is best used late-game once its checks and counters are removed, as it can setup Calm Minds with little to no trouble and sweep the foe's team. Keldeo's excellent typing also allows it to setup Calm Minds against Dark-, Steel-, and Rock-types such as Bisharp, Scizor, and Tyranitar.

Team Options
========
Deoxys-D and Deoxys-S are great partners for Keldeo, as the entry hazards they provide weakens a majority of its counters. Scizor is also a great partner, as it is able to provide momentum to Keldeo with U-turn while also being able to defeat a large majority of Keldeo's checks and counters. Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus-T are also able to provide momentum to Keldeo with Volt Switch, while also checking Water- and Flying-types that generally give Keldeo trouble. Keldeo appreciates Rain support from Politoed or a manual Rain Dance setter such as Thundurus, as it boost the power of Keldeo Water-type STAB moves, making it generally easier for Keldeo to sweep. If Rain support is not being used, then Heatran is a great partner, as it can setup Stealth Rock while also defeating a large majority of Keldeo's checks, including Celebi, Latias, Sylveon and Mega Venusaur. Aegislash, Bisharp, and Tyranitar are also great partners, as all three of them are able to pursuit trap a large majority of Keldeo's counters, making it easier for it to sweep.

Other Options
########
Keldeo's poor movepool leaves it with very few alternative options. Taunt is a viable move that Keldeo can run, allowing it to prevent moves such as Defog and Thunder Wave, although Keldeo loses to a majority of the Pokemon with these moves anyways. A SubCM can be used as well, allowing Keldeo to boost its special attack and special defense while avoiding status moves. However, in most scenarios, such a set is outclassed by Suicune and Manaphy. Rain Dance is a viable move Keldeo can use to boost the power of its Water-type STAB attacks, but Keldeo rarely has room to run it. Substitute can be used to take advantage of the switches Keldeo forces. Other Hidden Power types can also be to hit niche targets, such as using Hidden Power Grass for Gastrodon or Hidden Power Psychic for Tentacruel.

Keldeo can also use an alternative moveset with the moves Substitute / Endeavor / Toxic / Scald to lure its common counters, most notably Mega Venusaur. However, such a set is very gimmicky and is not recommended to be used.
