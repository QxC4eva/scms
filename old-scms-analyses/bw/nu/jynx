[Overview]

<p>The former queen of NU has returned, and she is just as powerful as ever. With a wide offensive movepool including her signature move Lovely Kiss, an amazing ability in the form of Dry Skin that lets her easily punish Water-types and rain teams alike by simply entering the field, and high stats perfectly tailored to abuse these traits, Jynx is without a doubt one of the strongest Pokemon in NU. She also sets an extremely important Speed tier in NU at base 95, which has quickly become the gold standard for Speed in a now very fast-paced metagame. As such, Jynx is an incredibly potent wallbreaker, sweeper, sleep-inducer, rain check, and revenge killer all at once. Unfortunately for Jynx, however, her absolutely pathetic defensive typing and stats leave her completely unable to take a hit, making her a tried-and-true glass cannon. She also fears the many forms of priority (excluding Aqua Jet, of course) that roam everywhere in NU, as they are likely to leave a huge dent in her, if not OHKO her.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Jynx has an excellent combination of power, Speed, and movepool that lets her pull off an effective Choice Scarf set. What she lacks in wallbreaking power, she makes up for in both Speed and utility. Ice Beam is once again Jynx's most powerful STAB. Psychic is another great STAB that provides decent coverage with Ice Beam and is chosen over Psyshock due to its higher initial power, which this set desperately needs. It is also especially helpful for revenge killing Carracosta after a Shell Smash with ease, as it hits Carracosta's weaker Special Defense. Trick provides a way to cripple all of Jynx's common switch-ins, such as Metang, Munchlax, and Grumpig, especially crippling any Eviolite user. Finally, Lovely Kiss in tandem with Choice Scarf turns Jynx into an incredibly fast sleep-inducer that can quickly and effectively remove a troubling opponent from the battle. Focus Blast can be used for extra coverage, but is not preferred as Choice Scarf Jynx lacks the ability to power through most special walls, and instead prefers to punish them through the use of Trick and Lovely Kiss. If you do opt to use Focus Blast, however, Lovely Kiss should be used over Trick as it is by far the best move at Jynx's disposal. Do note that this is the easiest set to force out due to being locked into one move. It is especially risky to use when threats like Skuntank are still on the field, but the extra Speed it possesses gives her much more opportunities to switch in and revenge kill the opponent. It should be noted that Choice Scarf is not Jynx's strongest set, and is not quite as effective as it once was. However, it's easily the best late-game cleaner out of all of Jynx's sets, and it gets its specific task done well.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Energy Ball is a viable move in place of Trick or Focus Blast (removing Lovely Kiss is not advised, as it is still Jynx's best move) to reliably revenge kill Gorebyss after a Shell Smash, but doesn't provide much use otherwise and Jynx loses out on a valuable move by doing so.</p>

<p>As for partners for this set, Fighting-types make excellent candidates to ensure Jynx can sweep and to make up for her loss of power. Sawk, Primeape, and Gurdurr perform excellently against special walls and Skuntank, and in general provide great offensive synergy with her. A Rapid Spin user is also appreciated, as this Jynx is forced out a lot and is weak to Stealth Rock, but because Jynx is mostly used to clean up and generally doesn't repeatedly switch in and out, it isn't mandatory. Still, Torkoal and Wartortle are the best partners if you do choose to have one.</p>

[SET]
name: Life Orb
move 1: Lovely Kiss

move 4: Focus Blast
item: Life Orb

nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set defines the term "immediate threat" in NU: if Jynx gets a free switch-in, she's almost guaranteed to at least cripple, if not completely destroy something on the opponent's side of the field. Lovely Kiss is a defining factor in this, as it guarantees absolutely nothing can get a free switch-in and easily incapacitates would-be counters to Jynx, such as Metang and Grumpig. Ice Beam is Jynx's most powerful STAB, and it easily smashes anything that doesn't resist it into the ground. Psychic and Psyshock are her two best Psychic STABs, and the choice between the two is completely up to you; Psychic has a higher Base Power and hits common Ice-resists such as Alomomola and Torkoal harder, and Psyshock hits most special walls such as Lickilicky and Munchlax harder. It should also be noted that Psyshock hits opposing Jynx for a guaranteed 2HKO. However, Psychic is still the preferred option because most of the foes Psychic hits are more common, and Jynx can hit most targets for Psyshock hard with her preferred coverage move, Focus Blast. Additionally, Focus Blast is able to hit Steel-types and other Pokemon that would be able to take Jynx's STABs, but should be used sparingly due to its unimpressive accuracy and low PP.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>You can use Energy Ball over Focus Blast to hit bulky Rock-types, such as Regirock, more reliably, but the extra power and coverage provided by Focus Blast is far more important. As for partners, Jynx highly appreciates entry hazard support as it helps her gain several KOs against the opposing team; Lickilicky, for example, can be 2HKOed by a combination of Psyshock and Focus Blast after Stealth Rock. Additionally, standard Torkoal and Piloswine can be OHKOed by Psychic and Focus Blast, respectively, after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Rock-types make good partners to set up Stealth Rock, as they can handle Fire-types that threaten Jynx as well as lure in Water-types for her to switch into. As for Spikes users, Scolipede is arguably the best partner for this task as it is able to take on Psychic- and Dark-types that Jynx can sometimes struggle with. Rapid Spin users are also appreciated due to Jynx's vulnerability to entry hazards-Stealth Rock in particular. However, it isn't absolutely mandatory as spinners in NU are rare, and all Jynx really needs is one free switch-in to start wreaking havoc. If you do choose to have a spinner, though, Torkoal and Wartortle are the best options for this role. Torkoal provides decent type synergy and boasts the ability to beat Metang, one of Jynx's counters, and Wartortle can also beat Metang as well as get past spinblockers through the use of Foresight. This Jynx is highly appreciated on teams that need a good wallbreaker or late-game cleaner, and she never disappoints in leaving her mark on the opposing team.</p>

[SET]
name: Focus Sash
move 1: Lovely Kiss
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Psyshock / Focus Blast
move 4: Nasty Plot / Focus Blast
item: Focus Sash
ability: Dry Skin
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This variant of Jynx functions by immediately putting pressure on the opponent from turn one. By utilizing her Focus Sash, she is almost guaranteed to be able to put something to sleep with Lovely Kiss or severely damage teams with her attacks. Lovely Kiss allows Jynx to put something out of commission and gives her an opportunity to either deal damage or set up Nasty Plot. Lovely Kiss also allows Jynx to put other leads to sleep, potentially preventing Stealth Rock from being set up. Ice Beam is Jynx's main STAB move and has excellent coverage in NU, hitting everything hard thanks to Jynx's high Special Attack. Psyshock is Jynx's secondary STAB move of choice as deals good damage to special walls such as Regice, Audino, Lickilicky, and Ludicolo and hits opposing Jynx the hardest out of any other move on this set. Focus Blast also hits these special walls hard and can even allow Jynx to hit Pokemon that Psyshock cannot such as Piloswine, Metang, Probopass, and Bastiodon, but it's unreliable in terms of accuracy when compared to Psyshock and misses out on opposing Jynx and specially defensive Ludicolo. Nasty Plot gives Jynx the opportunity to break through special walls with either Psyshock or Focus Blast and in general allows Jynx to tear teams apart with her attacks. This set has two main ways of being used: by either using three attacks and having more options against offense or using Nasty Plot and two attacks and breaking apart defensive teams more easily, meaning Jynx is very unpredictable and dangerous to any sort of team she could face.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As Jynx is used to open up holes in opposing teams, Pokemon that can clean up late-game such as Swellow, Choice Scarf Primeape, and SubSalac Scolipede make good partners. Because Jynx tends to lure in specially defensive Pokemon such as Regice, Audino, and Lickilicky and either removes them from the game or deals major damage to them, other special attackers that appreciate them gone make good partners as well. Ludicolo in particular works very well with Jynx and can even take advantage of Metang, who puts a stop to Jynx's shenanigans. Magnet Pull Probopass with Taunt can trap the Steel-type Pokemon that give Jynx trouble such as Metang, Probopass, and Bastiodon and also prevent Stealth Rock from being set up, allowing Jynx to keep her Focus Sash. Rapid Spin support is not required, but it is appreciated to keep Jynx's Focus Sash around as long as possible if it cannot be sent out first turn. Wartortle is the best Rapid Spin user in the tier, has good synergy with Jynx, and is able to almost guarantee a Rapid Spin with Foresight. Counter and Icy Wind allow Jynx to make great use of her Focus Sash and provide her with certain advantages that could make them worthwhile. Counter can be used over Nasty Plot or Focus Blast to fire back any damage taken from physical attacks from Pokemon, such as Metang, Piloswine, Scolipede, and Choice Scarf Primeape, that Jynx would have trouble with otherwise. Keep in mind, however, that Counter is illegal with Dry Skin and should therefore be used with Oblivious as Forewarn would give away the set by announcing its effect to both players. Icy Wind can be used to break the Focus Sash of opposing Scolipede and slow it down to knock it out, and it also slows down other faster Pokemon, such as Charizard and Serperior, so that Jynx can hit them again with an Ice Beam or start firing off Lovely Kisses before they can strike again. Energy Ball could be used as well to hit Seismitoad and still hit Piloswine, but it lacks much use outside of that.</p>

[SET]
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Lovely Kiss
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Substitute / Psyshock
item: Leftovers
ability: Dry Skin
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set packs neither the immediate power nor the versatility of the Life Orb or Choice Scarf sets, but makes up for it in several ways. Thanks to the combination of Substitute and Nasty Plot, this Jynx is able to boost her stats, protect herself from crippling status such as paralysis and poison, and take priority attacks from behind a Substitute, extending her longevity drastically. Despite Jynx's absolute frailty, it's actually quite easy for her to set up through the use of Lovely Kiss, and from there just continuously set up with Substitute, Nasty Plot and Lovely Kiss until Jynx is ready to start smashing through the opponent's team with boosted Ice Beams. Psyshock is a coverage option in the last slot to hit most Ice resists hard, but Jynx finds it much easier to set up when she's behind a Substitute. Do note this set is much more easily walled than the other sets with only Ice coverage, but it's much easier to sweep with the given tools.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set is much more of an offensive stallbreaker than anything else, and requires much more team support than the other sets to function properly. First off, Jynx absolutely requires something to deal with bulky Ice resists, such as Munchlax and Grumpig. These two Pokemon laugh at Ice Beam and even possess the ability to phaze via Whirlwind, ridding Jynx of all her hard-earned boosts. Rapid Spin support is not required, as this Jynx boasts much more longevity than the other sets, but it's still appreciated. This Jynx actually really appreciates something to get rid of Toxic Spikes, however, which are by far the most crippling hazard to this set. Jynx actually works exceptionally well in a rain team, as partners such as Ludicolo and Seismitoad can really help with dealing with most Ice resists, and Seismitoad can set up Stealth Rock for extra support. Additionally, Dry Skin heals Jynx in the rain, allowing her to heal off residual damage much faster and set up more Substitutes. In return, Jynx can easily handle Roselia and Mantine, two Pokemon that would normally easily handle rain teams. This particular variant of Jynx is much harder to use than the other two, and requires a lot of skill to work. However, it pays off in the end if you are able to use it efficiently.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Jynx has many other options at her disposal, but none of them really bring out her fullest potential. Perhaps her most interesting option is her famous Luna set: a Calm Mind set similar to the Nasty Plot set but with investment in HP rather than Special Attack. However, Jynx's stats are not that of a bulky booster, and the Nasty Plot set boosts much faster and thus is preferred. Taunt and Magic Coat can be used to block and bounce back status, respectively, but Jynx does not have the room for these moves and Lovely Kiss usually gets the job done anyway. She can use a combination of Mean Look and Perish Song to Perish Trap in conjunction with Lovely Kiss, but this is an extremely risky tactic and a waste of Jynx's offensive potential. She has a colorful support movepool including Wish, Heal Bell, Light Screen, and Reflect, but does not have the bulk or typing to pull off the role of a supporter, and again wastes her offensive potential.</p>

<p>Jynx can utilize Choice Specs over Life Orb to further increase her power, but Life Orb allows for switching up moves and is preferred because of that. Additionally, Life Orb recoil isn't too bothersome as Jynx is unable to take hits anyway. On the Nasty Plot set, she could use Salac Berry in tandem with Substitute to boost her Speed as well as her Special Attack, but mono-Ice coverage is undesirable for that kind of set and one of the main selling points of the set is her ability to repeatedly set up Substitutes. Shadow Ball and Signal Beam can be used to provide coverage against Psychic- and Ghost-types, but don't provide much else otherwise, and Ice Beam usually hits them hard enough. Finally, a more offensive Nasty Plot set with a Focus Sash can attempt to weaken the opponent's team from the start of the game, but Jynx usually prefers to wreak havoc later on in the match rather than just dying at the start.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Jynx really does not have any counters in the strictest sense of the word, due to her amazing Special Attack, select movepool and, most importantly, Lovely Kiss. This makes her capable of incapacitating almost any so-called "counters" for the rest of the match. However, once Sleep Clause is activated, there are certain Pokemon that can shakily check her. Metang laughs at Jynx's STABs, has the bulk to shrug off a Focus Blast, and can OHKO her with Meteor Mash. Grumpig, with its Thick Fat, can easily take anything Jynx normally carries, but really can't do much in return aside from Whirlwind. Munchlax can also take almost anything Jynx throws at it (including Lovely Kiss), but must beware of Trick and Life Orb-boosted Psyshocks.</p>

<p>The Choice Scarf set can be beaten through prediction, as she can be easily played around because she is locked into one move. Skuntank also serves as an excellent check as it is immune to Psychic, can live an Ice Beam and OHKO with its STAB move of choice. Most Pursuit users in general can serve as good checks, such as Choice Scarf Tauros, Scolipede, and Swellow. Special walls such as Lickilicky, Audino, and Regice also get a mention as Choice Scarf Jynx lacks the power to break through them. As for the Nasty Plot set, bulky Ice-type resists&mdash;particularly Munchlax and Grumpig with their ability to phaze&mdash;are the best way to go. In general, Pokemon that resist Ice-type attacks will do a fine against Nasty Plot variants of Jynx as its lack of coverage prevents it from doing much damage to them. Piloswine, Regice, and Probopass all do well against the Nasty Plot and Choice Scarf variants as they are capable of taking Jynx's attacks and forcing it out; Piloswine and Probopass in particular can also set up Stealth Rock to wear it down and Probopass can also use Volt Switch to gain the switch advantage against Jynx.</p>

<p>However, it should be noted that the easiest way to beat Jynx is to revenge kill her. Faster Choice Scarf users, such as Zebstrika and Charizard, can outspeed all variants of Jynx and OHKO her with their Fire-type moves. Priority attacks (sans Aqua Jet) are also good ways to revenge kill her with her abysmal bulk. Offensive Metang's Bullet Punch, however, gets a special mention as Metang can actually switch in on Jynx's STABs, and in return OHKO her after Stealth Rock. Kangaskhan's Fake Out also ensures a "free hit" with its 100% flinch rate, making it a good check. Finally, as Jynx is prone to wearing herself down whether through Life Orb recoil, Substitute, or entry hazards, sometimes the best way to beat Jynx is to wait for her to take herself down.</p>
