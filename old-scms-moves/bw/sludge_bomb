<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to poison the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While Sludge Bomb does have a respectable Base Power and a nice secondary effect, it is an often neglected move for a few reasons. Since Poison only hits Grass-types super effectively, Sludge Bomb is rarely used as a coverage type on any special attacker, with the exception as a STAB move. In addition, most Poison-type Pokemon are not geared to be special attackers. However, there are some Pokemon, like Gengar, who can use Sludge Bomb as a STAB move. Unfortunately for Sludge Bomb, other moves, such as Shadow Ball, Focus Blast, Disable, and Substitute, leave Gengar hard-pressed to actually fit Sludge Bomb onto any moveset.</p>
