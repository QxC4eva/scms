<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage on the turn after it is used. If the move is prevented from being used after the user has charged up, then the entire move is canceled, but PP is still deducted. If the user holds the item Power Herb, the move will not require a turn to charge. If used in sunshine, the move does not require a turn to charge. If used in rain, hail, or sandstorm, the move's Base Power is halved.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sun seems to be one of the only weather conditions in OU that has not had limitations put on it, and SolarBeam certainly is a move to be used in the sun. Given to many Grass- and Fire-types, it is notable in allowing the latter to hit Water-types, who are already nerfed in the sun. Some notable users include Moltres, who has a massive Special Attack stat and complements Venusaur, a common sun sweeper, well. Coincidentally, if a user is feeling risky, they could use SolarBeam on Venusaur alongside Growth (another move to be used in the sun) due to its massive damage output. SolarBeam does have the unfortunate drawback of luring in other weather manipulators, who will come in as the user sets up and essentially trap them. In the other tiers, SolarBeam is still a semi-viable strategy; of course, Drought is banned in UU and below, and Vulpix is banned from Little Cup.</p>
