Overview
########
Say hello to Medicham, a Pokemon that has suffered in the lower tiers of competitive battling in the past but has received new hope for its existence in OU due to its Mega Evolution. It has a fantastic ability, Pure Power, which doubles its Attack stat, boosting Mega Medicham's Attack stat to an equivalent of base 249 with a positive nature and maximum Attack investment. Additionally, Mega Medicham is the fastest user of Pure / Huge Power and Medicham also has a good movepool that allows it to annihilate any type of foe. Unfortunately, it does suffer from four-moveslot syndrome, and its moves are generally of a mediocre Base Power aside from High Jump Kick, which has its own downfall in unreliability. Still, Medicham is a powerful physical attacker worthy of a spot on any offensive team.

Moves
========
Mega Medicham boasts one of the highest Attack stats in the game and a fantastic base 100 Speed to back it up, which Azumarill, Kyurem-B, and Mega Mawile don't. This set is built to simply use all that power to its fullest potential. High Jump Kick is used because it's simply Medicham's strongest physical STAB move. While it is powerful, don't be reckless with it, as a Ghost-type switch-in or a miss can be costly. Fire Punch is used to annihilate the common Aegislash that otherwise gives Medicham problems as well as to incinerate Scizor and Genesect. If hitting Gliscor, Landorus, Landorus-T, and Dragonite (as well as reliably hitting Garchomp) is a concern for your team, Ice Punch is the best way to deal with them. Zen Headbutt is a great secondary STAB move for Medicham and it also allows Medicham to hit Jellicent and physically defensive Mega Venusaur, which normally take very little from Medicham's attacks. It also lets Medicham beat defensive Fairy-types such as Clefable and Sylveon and deal good damage to Azumarill. For the last slot, Substitute can be very useful to ease prediction as well as keeping Medicham from being statused. Bullet Punch is also a good option to allow Medicham to function as a revenge killer and hit faster threats before they hit it.

Set Details
========
Medichamite is essential for the massive stat boosts all around achieved by the Mega Evolution. A Jolly nature gives Medicham the maximum Speed possible to help ensure you'll outspeed certain Pokemon, although an Adamant nature can provide more power, enabling Mega Medicham to reach the impressive base 249 Attack. Overall, a Jolly nature provides more consistency at the cost of greater wallbreaking power.

Usage Tips
========
Mega Medicham is basically a nuke, but it has trouble switching into battle, so your team should have ways to bring it in safely, such as U-turn or Volt Switch. Successfully setting up a Substitute is instrumental to doing heavy damage with Mega Medicham since you don't have to predict as much; Medicham can attack much more freely when it doesn't fear a potential OHKO in return. Setting up a Substitute on the prediction of a Ghost-type switch-in or faster fighting resist is key. Mega Medicham can deal the maximum amount of devastation to enemy teams if you're setting up a Substitute when you predict the enemy to switch out into another Pokemon or hitting a predicted switch in for the most possible damage.

Team Options
========
Good teammates for Mega Medicham are Pokemon with access to U-turn or Volt Switch because it doesn't like hard switching into attacks due to its frailty. Among Pokemon found on VoltTurning teams, Scizor is a great partner because Mega Medicham takes care of many checks to Scizor. Rotom-W is a great Volt Switch user that is capable of stomaching attacks from common priority users that want to pick off Mega Medicham and retaliate by crippling it with a burn. Mid- to late-game sweepers such as Lucario or Terrakion are great teammates for Mega Medicham because they can sweep with ease after Mega Medicham has already broken down all the enemy walls.

Other Options
########
Thunder Punch can be used to hit Pokemon such as Slowbro, Azumarill, and Gyarados, but using this move sacrifices a ton of useful type coverage or the ever-useful Substitute. If you really want to use Mega Medicham as a sweeper, interchange the third or fourth moveslot for Bulk Up. The Defense boost from Bulk Up is a waste, but achieving over 900 Attack is something that even some of the best physical sweepers that have access to Swords Dance can only dream to have. Your opponent will also usually expect Mega Medicham to be a wallbreaker instead of a sweeper.

Checks & Counters
########
**Slowbro**: Slowbro completely stops Medicham, taking nothing from all of Medicham's attacks and using Regenerator to recovery off the damage. Medicham can run Thunder Punch, but that is rarely more appropriate to use over any other of Medicham's moves.

**Aegislash**: Aegislash can also come in on every move besides Fire Punch and threaten to either KO Medicham or use King's Shield to lower its attack in the event tat it attacks.

**Chandelure**: Choice Scarf Chandelure resists all of Medicham's moves except for Zen Headbutt and can OHKO it with Shadow Ball.

**Common Priority Users**: Talonflame can revenge kill Medicham with a priority Brave Bird, but it doesn't like switching into High Jump Kick. Likewise, Choice Band Scizor and other common priority users can pick off a slightly weakened Mega Medicham

**Strong Choice Scarf Users**: Strong Choice Scarf users that are not OHKOed by Bullet Punch can revenge kill Medicham.
