<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>With the release of ORAS, many people would think that we would have to give the new metagame some time to adapt before forming any opinions on how the newly introduced Mega Evolutions will affect OU. However, through late October and most of November, an ORAS OU Ladder was implemented into Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! after the new data was leaked from the game demo, which allowed everyone to play with the new toys a little bit early and see how they fare in OU. In this article, I'll go over every new Mega Evolution introduced with ORAS and how they affect the tier, as well as their most effective set and how to use it.</p>

<h2>The Megas:</h2>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/sceptile-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Sceptile<br />
Base Stats:<br />
Base Form: 70 / 85 / 65 / 105 / 85 / 120<br />
Mega: 70 / 110 / 75 / 145 / 85 / 145 </strong></p>

<p>Sceptile got the buffs it needed to become a force to be reckoned with in OU. Its new Grass / Dragon typing gave it some good resistances and powerful Dragon-type STAB moves to work with, the most notable one being Dragon Pulse. Additionally, it got a massive increase in its Special Attack and Speed, which allow it to put in work against offensive teams once it has Mega Evolved. Its new ability, Lightning Rod, is admittedly situational, as Sceptile already has a 4x resistance to Electric-type attacks. It does, however, give Sceptile a cool niche in blocking Volt Switch and being a full stop to Rotom-W.</p>

<p>Sceptile @ Sceptilite<br />
Ability: Overgrow<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD/ 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Focus Blast / Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>This set's main goal is to come in on something Sceptile forces out, Mega Evolve, then set up a Substitute. This allows for an easier time handling bulky offense and balance teams, as it eases prediction and protects against status. Giga Drain is a STAB move that recovers HP to allow for more Substitutes, while Dragon Pulse is used to hit opposing Dragons and other Pok&eacute;mon that resist Grass-type moves. The last slot provides coverage against Steel-types. Focus Blast is good for nailing every Steel-type not named Scizor, while Hidden Power Fire is a good option against Ferrothorn, Mega Metagross, and Mega Scizor.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/swampert-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Swampert<br />
Base Stats:<br />
Base Form: 100 / 110 / 90 / 85 / 90 / 60<br />
Mega: 100 / 150 / 110 / 95 / 110 / 70</strong></p>

<p>After one and a half generations of obscurity and dwelling in the depths of UU, Swampert has made a splash in OU once again with its new Mega Evolution. Receiving big buffs in its Attack and defenses, Swampert has the power and bulk to be a dominant force in the metagame. That's not all, though, as Swampert's new ability is Swift Swim, which doubles its speed under rain. This finally gives rain teams the Pok&eacute;mon they've been looking for, as a Water / Ground type has excellent STAB coverage and an immunity to Thunder Wave, which only Seismitoad could boast before. Previously, Kabutops was the go-to physical Swift Swimmer, but Swampert is stepping up to claim the throne, as it has a higher Attack, better coverage, a better defensive typing, and much higher bulk.</p>

<p>Swampert @ Swampertite<br />
Ability: Torrent<br />
EVs: 104 HP / 252 Atk / 152 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Low Kick / Superpower / Protect</p>

<p>Swampert's best set is its rain sweeper set, hands down. It has the bulk, typing, and STAB attacks to do this extremely effectively. Waterfall is its main STAB move, and despite having a lower Base Power than Earthquake, Waterfall is boosted in the rain, which allows it to actually outdamage Earthquake when both hit their targets neutrally. Ice Punch is the mandatory coverage option in the third slot, as it provides important coverage against the likes of Dragons and Grass-types. Finally, the last slot is a toss-up between a Fighting-type move and Protect, which allows Swampert to safely Mega Evolve. The Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Mega Sceptile in the rain.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/sableye-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Sableye<br />
Base Stats:<br />
Base Form: 50 / 75 / 75 / 65 / 65 / 50<br />
Mega: 50 / 85 / 125 / 85 / 115 / 20</strong></p>

<p>Sableye's massive defense buffs and improved Special Attack has made it a staple on stall teams already. Its ability, Magic Bounce, also makes it a terrifying Calm Mind sweeper, as any attempts to Taunt or status it will simply be bounced back. This also applies to entry hazards, as previous common Stealth Rock users like Ferrothorn and Landorus-T have lost some viability due to being completely walled by Mega Sableye. Additionally, regular Sableye's ability, Prankster, allows it to be useful even before Mega Evolving, as getting off priority Will-O-Wisps and Recovers can greatly bolster its effectiveness and longevity.</p>

<p>Sableye @ Sableite<br />
Ability: Prankster<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Will-O-Wisp<br />
- Recover<br />
- Shadow Ball / Dark Pulse</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><img src="oras-megas.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Sableye's best set is arguably its Calm Mind set, as it poses utility against a wide range of playstyles. Sableye can spread around burns with Prankster Will-O-Wisp and heal with Prankster Recover before Mega Evolving. Additionally, it can set up a Calm Mind against a plethora of special attackers the turn it Mega Evolves, which allows it to take on top-tier special threats like Greninja, Keldeo, and Latios much better. The choice between Shadow Ball and Dark Pulse boils down to having better neutral coverage or no immunities. Both have their merits and are equally viable, so it really just comes down to personal preference.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/beedrill-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Beedrill<br />
Base Stats:<br />
Base Form: 65 / 90 / 40 / 45 / 80 / 75<br />
Mega: 65 / 150 / 40 / 15 / 80 / 145</strong></p>

<p>Let's bee honest here, who would have ever thought that Beedrill would be relevant in OU? Like everyone else, you were wrong when you said no for the past 15+ years. Beedrill got one of the most lopsided stat increases, as its Attack and Speed skyrocket to match those of even Ubers Pok&eacute;mon. To do this, they even took away from its Special Attack just to reach those numbers. Add on the fact that it received Adaptability as its ability, and you'd think that there's no reason not to use it. However, it got no boost to its bulk and has a poor Bug / Poison typing, leaving it susceptible to all priority moves not named Mach Punch. Its STAB moves aren't particularly impressive either, as it is completely walled by Steel-types when it isn't using Drill Run, and its coverage is all but nonexistent. Additionally, it has a poor Speed tier before Mega Evolving, which forces it to run Protect in order to Mega Evolve safely.</p>

<p>Beedrill @ Beedrillite<br />
Ability: Swarm<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant / Jolly Nature<br />
- Protect<br />
- Poison Jab<br />
- U-Turn<br />
- Drill Run / Knock Off</p>

<p>Beedrill's best set is not a Swords Dance set. It does not have the bulk or access to priority to make use of any boosts. Beedrill's best set is a dual STAB momentum-grabbing set. U-Turn is its best move, as it deals a large blow to even some resists, like Landorus-T. Poison Jab is used to clean up late-game, as it gets decent neutral coverage and makes Fairies regret ever becoming a type. Protect is used to scout Choice item attackers and to Mega Evolve safely. Its last slot goes to either Drill Run or Knock Off, as they both have merits over the other. Drill Run is preferred, however, as it allows Beedrill to get past Steel-types that would otherwise wall it. Both Adamant and Jolly are viable options, but Adamant is preferred to maximize Beedrill's damage output.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/camerupt-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Camerupt<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 70 / 100 / 70 / 105 / 75 / 40<br />
Mega: 70 / 120 / 100 / 145 / 105 / 20</strong></p>

<p>Despite getting a great buff to both its offensive and defensive stats, Camerupt struggles to make a significant impact in OU. That's not to say it's bad, however, as it still holds a niche as a powerful special attacker that is able to take on the likes of Mew, Mega Gardevoir, and any Electric-type not named Rotom-W. Additionally, Camerupt has access to Sheer Force, which boosts its two main STAB moves, as well as coverage like Rock Slide, Ancient Power, and Flash Cannon. It even has access to Will-O-Wisp, which is a great move to use on Pok&eacute;mon like Azumarill on the switch. However, a 4x weakness to Water and a very low Speed stat stop it from being a top-tier threat.</p>

<p>Camerupt @ Cameruptite<br />
Ability: Solid Rock<br />
EVs: 172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe<br />
Modest nature<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Ancient Power<br />
- Will-O-Wisp / Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>Camerupt is best used as a bulky special attacker to take full advantage of Sheer Force, which boosts its STAB moves. Additionally, Ancient Power receives a boost as well, and it's useful for hitting the likes of Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and other Flying-types. The final slot is for coverage against Water-types with Hidden Power Grass or to cripple opposing physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Neither option is definitively better than the other, as it really depends on the team. Hidden Power Ice can also be used to hit Dragons on the switch, as it OHKOes Garchomp and does upwards of 50% to the likes of Latios and Latias. The Speed EVs allow Camerupt to outspeed and 2HKO Slowbro with Earth Power.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/sharpedo-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Sharpedo<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 70 / 120 / 40 / 95 / 40 / 95<br />
Mega: 70 / 140 / 70 / 110 / 65 / 105</strong></p>

<p>Mega Sharpedo is one of those Pok&eacute;mon that would be good if it wasn't a Mega Evolution. It has great all-around stats, and an ability, Strong Jaw, which boosts its STAB Crunch to insane levels. However, it finds itself foregone in favor of other, more powerful Mega Evolutions. Despite this, it still has its uses as a late-game cleaner. Its pre-Mega Evolution ability, Speed Boost, allows it to KO a weakened target or use Protect to gain a Speed Boost. After Mega Evolving, it outspeeds a good portion of the metagame and can clean up weakened teams with Strong Jaw Crunch and Ice Fang. If you prefer, it can even make use of its Special Attack stat by using Ice Beam instead of Ice Fang, but both have their uses.</p>

<p>Sharpedo @ Sharpedonite<br />
Ability: Speed Boost<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant / Naughty Nature<br />
- Protect<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Ice Fang / Ice Beam</p>

<p>Sharpedo's best set is a late-game cleaner set to take advantage of its base forme's Speed Boost and clean up weakened teams with Strong Jaw-boosted Crunches. Protect is there to guarantee at least one Speed Boost, as a base 105 Speed with an Adamant nature isn't particularly fast without the boost. Waterfall is the secondary STAB move, but it should only be used when Crunch is resisted, or when Waterfall hits super effectively, as Crunch is otherwise more powerful. Ice Fang also gets a Strong Jaw boost and is useful for hitting Dragon- and Grass-types super effectively. If physically defensive Landorus-T is a problem, however, then Ice Beam can be used instead to guarantee the OHKO.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/altaria-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Altaria<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 75 / 70 / 90 / 70 / 105 / 80<br />
Mega: 75 / 110 / 110 / 110 / 105 / 80</strong></p>

<p>Altaria is another one of those Pok&eacute;mon that has never had the chance to shine in the higher tiers in any generation. It has always been held back by mediocre stats and a typing that has been severely overdone. However, ORAS granted Altaria the greatest gift ever in the form of a Mega Evolution, which changes its bland Dragon / Flying typing into an amazing Dragon / Fairy typing. On top of this, Altaria received Pixilate as an ability, which grants a 1.3x boost to all Normal-type moves and changes them into Fairy-type attacks. Lastly, Altaria's stats got universal boosts, which allows it to perform multiple roles effectively for any type of team. This is only bolstered by its movepool that contains gems like Hyper Voice, Return, Dragon Dance, and Heal Bell.</p>

<p>Altaria @ Altarite<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 116 Atk / 136 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Impish Nature<br />
-Dragon Dance<br />
-Return<br />
-Roost / Refresh<br />
-Earthquake / Fire Blast</p>

<p>This set is arguably Altaria's most effective set. Dragon Dance boosts both its Attack and Speed, and with the HP and Defense investment, allow Altaria to rack up boosts in tandem with Roost thanks to its excellent defensive typing. Return is the obligatory STAB move here, as Fairy is an excellent attacking type. To round off its coverage, both Fire Blast and Earthquake work in the last slot. Earthquake gets boosted by Dragon Dance and hits many Steel-types like Heatran and Jirachi super effectively. However, Fire Blast is a good option in you want to hit Ferrothorn, (Mega) Scizor, and Skarmory harder. Additionally, Refresh over Roost is an option in order to avoid burns from bulky Water-types, but Roost is generally the superior option, as it makes it harder to wear Altaria down.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/gallade-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Gallade<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 68 / 125 / 65 / 65 / 115 / 80<br />
Mega: 68 / 165 / 95 / 65 / 115 / 110</strong></p>

<p>Many people expected Gallade to get a Mega Evolution after seeing Mega Gardevoir, and ORAS has granted our wish. Gallade got a massive boost to his viability, as his once-mediocre base Speed of 80 got boosted to a very respectable base 110. Additionally, his Attack stat was boosted to an insane base 165, and his once pitiful physical Defense is now a respectable base 95, meaning he can actually live a hit or two. Unfortunately, he received a less-than-impressive ability in Inner Focus, but even that hasn't stopped him from becoming a top-tier threat. His movepool, stats, and amazing cape have pushed Mega Medicham into obscurity, and it's looking to stay that way for the rest of Generation VI.</p>

<p>Gallade @ Galladite<br />
Ability: Justified<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Zen Headbutt<br />
- Knock Off</p>

<p>Gallade's most effective set is his Swords Dance set, hands down. Thanks to his excellent dual-STAB coverage and great Speed stat, he has no trouble forcing out slower Pok&eacute;mon and nabbing a boost. His coverage move of choice is Knock Off. Not only does it hit the bulky Psychic-types that he would otherwise have trouble with, but it also removes items and is in general a very spammable move. Both Close Combat and Zen Headbutt are his STAB moves of choice, as Gallade likes the high damage output provided from each of these moves to deal as much damage as possible. The only variation that I could recommend on this set is Poison Jab over Knock Off, but that should only be used if Clefable gives your team trouble.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/metagross-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Metagross<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 80 / 135 / 130 / 95 / 90 / 70<br />
Mega: 80 / 145 / 150 / 105 / 110 / 110</strong></p>

<p>Aside from being the coolest Mega Evolution introduced in ORAS, Mega Metagross is also arguably the strongest. Metagross fell into obscurity after Generation IV due to a number of factors, with the main ones being a mediocre base 70 Speed and having poor offensive STAB coverage. However, Metagross got everything it could dream of to dominate OU once again. Its Speed was increased to a base 110, which puts it near the top of OU in terms of Speed tiers. Additionally, both its Defense and Special Defense received massive buffs, giving it excellent 80 / 150 / 110 bulk along with a very good Steel-typing. Metagross also received a small boost to both its Attack and Special Attack stats, but its most notable buff was the ability it received: Tough Claws, which is an excellent ability, as we already know from Mega Charizard X and Mega Aerodactyl. Metagross has all the right moves to take advantage of its ability with dual STAB attacks, the elemental Punches, and even Grass Knot. All these traits have pulled it from obscurity to becoming a top tier-threat.</p>

<p>Metagross @ Metagrossite<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Meteor Mash<br />
- Zen Headbutt<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Earthquake / Hammer Arm / Grass Knot</p>

<p>Mega Metagross has two extremely effective sets. One is a Rock Polish set, while the other is an all-out attacking set. The latter is more consistent as it takes full advantage of the buffs it received, which is why it is the one that is chosen to be covered. It becomes a premier check for top-tier threats such as Latios, Mega Gardevoir, Azumarill, Clefable, and Sylveon, while also sporting the coverage to hit most of its switch-ins extremely hard. A Tough Claws-boosted Meteor Mash hits insanely hard and should be the go-to move against anything neutral or weak to it. Zen Headbutt is a secondary STAB move capable of 2HKOing even physically defensive Rotom-W. Ice Punch is the first coverage move, as it hits Dragon- and Ground-types hard for super effective damage while also gaining a boost from Tough Claws. The last slot is used to determine what actually counters Metagross. If Hammer Arm is used, both Ferrothorn and Skarmory lose, as the Speed drop allows Metagross to underspeed the latter. Earthquake is useful for hitting Heatran and other Pok&eacute;mon weak to Ground such as Mega Charizard X. Lastly, Grass Knot is capable of 2HKOing physically defensive (Mega) Slowbro, which otherwise hard walls Metagross.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/diancie-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Diancie<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 50 / 100 / 150 / 100 / 150 / 50<br />
Mega: 50 / 160 / 110 / 160 / 110 / 110</strong></p>

<p>Diancie, when first released, was hyped up to be an offensive Pok&eacute;mon thanks to its good offensive typing in Rock / Fairy, as well as powerful offensive STAB attacks. Sadly, that wasn't the case thanks to a pitiful base 50 Speed. However, Diancie became the first Gen VI Pok&eacute;mon to receive a Mega Evolution, and with the addition of Earth Power to its movepool via Move Tutor, it has become a real threat in OU. It got buffs to both of its offensive stats at the cost of its bulk, which gives its base 160 Attack and Special Attack to work with. Additionally, a base 110 Speed allows it to Speed tie with other top threats like Latios, Mega Metagross, and Mega Gallade. Its movepool also contains gems such as Diamond Storm, which is a Stone Edge that doesn't miss as much and has a chance to raise its Defense one stage, Moonblast, and Earth Power. Additionally, it has access to two boosting moves in Rock Polish and Calm Mind, which cause trouble for offensive and defensive teams alike, respectively. Finally, its new ability Magic Bounce allows it to not care about attempts to status her, and it can even bounce back entry hazards as well. However, a 4x weakness to Steel and being forced to run a mixed set to take advantage of Diamond Storm keep it from being at the top of the pack.</p>

<p>Diancie @ Diancite<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Diamond Storm<br />
- Moonblast<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>Diancie's best set is an all-out attacking set, as without it, it lacks valuable coverage against important threats. Diamond Storm is the only Rock-type STAB attack worth using, and it is used to take on the likes of Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, Gardevoir, and Mega Venusaur. Moonblast is its secondary STAB attack, which is the move it should spam the most, as it sports great power and gets good neutral coverage against most types. Earth Power is to nail Steel-types such as Heatran, Bisharp, Mega Metagross, and Jirachi for a lot of damage, while Hidden Power Fire is to hit Ferrothorn and nail (Mega) Scizor on the switch. If Scizor and Ferrothorn aren't a problem, however, then either Calm Mind or Rock Polish can be used, depending on what your team needs.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/audino-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Audino<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 103 / 60 / 86 / 60 / 86 / 50<br />
Mega: 103 / 60 / 126 / 80 / 126 / 50</strong></p>

<p>Audino was a Pok&eacute;mon that was never relevant in higher tiers, and unfortunately, it seems to remain that way, even with its new Mega Evolution. Despite gaining massive defensive buffs and a Fairy typing, Audino gained a useless ability for Singles in Healer. Had it kept Regenerator, everything would be entirely different, but for now, it remains outclassed by other defensive Fairies such as Clefable and Sylveon. It does, however, hold an interesting niche in being a good special wall that doesn't fear anything from most special attackers, and it still has the physical bulk to take on neutral physical hits.</p>

<p>Audino @ Audinite<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Protect<br />
- Wish<br />
- Dazzling Gleam<br />
- Heal Bell / Toxic</p>

<p>Audino is best used as a specially defensive wall, as it takes on the likes of Latios, Mega Gardevoir, Thundurus, and other special attackers extremely well. Its only form of recovery is from Wish + Protect, but it can get the job done if played smartly. Dazzling Gleam is the only offensive move Audino should run, as it gains a STAB boost and hits decently hard, though it won't score any OHKOs any time soon. The last slot is a toss-up between team support and being able to wear down opposing walls. Heal Bell is always a great move, as it removes status from your teammates, but Toxic allows Audino to not be total setup bait for setup sweepers.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/slowbro-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Slowbro<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base From: 95 / 75 / 110 / 100 / 80 / 30<br />
Mega: 95 / 75 / 180 / 130 / 80 / 30</strong></p>

<p>When Mega Slowbro was first revealed, it was laughed at not only for its design, but for its seemingly useless ability, Shell Armor. However, that soon changed when its stats were released. Mega Slowbro got an insane buff to its Defense and Special Attack. Combined with Shell Armor and access to Calm Mind, Slowbro makes for a devastating late-game sweeper. Its titanic base 180 Defense backed by a solid base 95 HP means that only the strongest of physical hits will be able to bring it down. However, Mega Slowbro is plagued with an average defensive typing and a terrible Speed tier. Additionally, Mega Slowbro's mediocre base 80 Special Defense means that strong special attacks will be able to break it before it can accumulate too many boosts.</p>

<p>Slowbro @ Slowbronite<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
IVs: 0 Atk<br />
- Scald<br />
- Psyshock<br />
- Fire Blast / Ice Beam<br />
- Slack Off<br /></p>

<p>The only reason to use Mega Slowbro over its base forme is for its offensive capabilities, as a pure defensive set sorely misses Regenerator. When Mega Evolved, Slowbro makes for a formidable tank that has a high damage output along with great Defense. 248 HP EVs and 252 EVs in Special Attack max out its bulk and power, which allows it to hit fairly hard with its dual STAB attacks and a coverage move of choice. Scald is used for its nifty 30% burn chance, which only bolsters Slowbro's amazing defense if the RNG is in its favor. Psyshock is Slowbro's other STAB attack, which is used to hit Poison and Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Amoonguss, and deal respectable damage to Pok&eacute;mon that resist Scald. The third slot is used for a coverage move. Fire Blast hits Grass-types such as Ferrothorn hard, while Ice Beam can be used if Dragon-types are a problem. Slack Off is in the last slot to keep Slowbro healthy throughout the match.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/steelix-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Steelix<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 75 / 85 / 200 / 55 / 65 / 30<br />
Mega: 75 / 125 / 230 / 55 / 95 / 30</strong></p>

<p>Ever since the GSC era, Steelix has fallen out of favor for other, better Pok&eacute;mon in OU. New hope arrived for it when it received a Mega Evolution, but unfortunately, it seems as if it will stay in obscurity. In theory, Mega Steelix isn't bad. It has a titanic base 230 defense alongside a good base 75 HP, which allows it to eat up physical hits for breakfast. Additionally, its base 125 Attack is no slouch either, especially when it has access to a Ground-type STAB attack in Earthquake. Unfortunately, that's where the positives stop. Mega Steelix has an abysmal base Speed of only 30 and no form of reliable recovery, which leaves it prone to being worn down throughout the match. Additionally, Steelix's Special Defense is average at best, and most special attackers will be able to 2HKO it with neutral hits.</p>

<p>Steelix @ Steelixite<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def<br />
Adamant / Brave Nature<br />
- Heavy Slam / Gyro Ball<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Fire Fang / Curse</p>

<p>Steelix's best niche in the metagame is being used on a sand team as an abuser of Sand Force. It has a niche over Mega Garchomp in this regard in that it trades Speed and power for a lot more physical bulk and a better defensive typing. Steelix is very heavy, and its access to Heavy Slam lets it abuse its weight to its full potential, especially since many of the Fairy- and Rock-types that it hits super effectively are relatively light compared to the Steel Titan. However, Steelix also has an extremely powerful Gyro Ball under the sand thanks to its extremely low Speed and Sand Force, so both are viable options, though Heavy Slam is chosen because it has more PP. Earthquake is the tried and true Ground-type STAB attack, while Stone Edge provides coverage against the likes of Flying-types such as Mega Pinsir and Talonflame. In the last slot, Fire Fang is there to have a move that does noticeable damage to Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Scizor, but if you have those covered, Curse can be used instead to boost Steelix's Attack and Defense, while also powering up Gyro Ball even more thanks to the Speed drop.</p>

<p>Pidgeot has always been the starting bird that serves everyone well in-game, but falls by the wayside on the competitive side of things. To somewhat fix this, Gamefreak decided to give Pidgeot a Mega Evolution that allows it to abuse Hurricane and Heat Wave to its full potential thanks to No Guard, an ability that bypasses accuracy checks for both Pok&eacute;mon on the field (Why no Focus Blast Gamefreak ;_;). Along with an increased Special Attack and Speed, Pidgeot received a small buff to its previously nonexistent bulk, which allows it to finally be able to tank hits. Despite all this, however, Pidgeot still has very little viability in OU itself, as it faces direct competition from Tornadus-T, a Pok&eacute;mon that sports much better bulk, has the ability to hold an item, a larger movepool, and has access to Regenerator to negate Stealth Rock damage. Pidgeot is still usable, but should never be your first choice for building a serious competitive team.</p>

<p>Pidgeot @ Pidgeotite<br />
Ability: Big Pecks<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Hurricane<br />
- Heat Wave<br />
- Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Fighting<br />
- Roost / U-Turn</p>

<p>Pidgeot should always be running a special attacking set should you choose to run it. It has access to Hurricane, a 110 Base Power STAB attack that sports good coverage and has a small confusion chance is too good to pass up, and is the move you should be spamming the most. Heat Wave is Pidgeot's best coverage move, as it hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory that would otherwise give Pidgeot trouble. Hidden Power Ice is a good option to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp for a large blow, while Hidden Power Fighting works for Tyranitar, an otherwise great check to Pidgeot. However, they should only be used when they hit a target for 4x damage, as even a 2x resisted Hurricane outdamages a super effective Hidden Power. The last slot is between longevity and the ability to maintain momentum. Both Roost and U-Turn work well thanks to Pidgeot's high Speed, so it really depends on your team's needs.</p>

<p><strong>Lopunny<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 65 / 76 / 84 / 54 / 96 / 105<br />
Mega: 65 / 136 / 94 / 54 / 96 / 135</strong></p>

<p>Having been ridiculed for having terrible stats and useless abilities since Generation IV, Lopunny was always doomed to be at the bottom of the barrel, even in NU. Any mention of using Lopunny in OU was laughable, as there simply was absolutely no reason to use it. However, Game Freak gave it a Mega Evolution, and it made everyone eat the bad things that they said about it for all those years. It got a type change to Normal / Fighting and received High Jump Kick as a new level up move. Its greatest asset, however, is its ability: Scrappy, which is what makes Lopunny such a threat, giving it perfect neutral coverage with its STAB attacks alone and allowing it two free moveslots to work with. It also has a decent Attack stat and blazing Speed, which makes the lives of offensive teams hell, similar to Greninja. Gems in its movepool like Heal Bell, Healing Wish, and Baton Pass allow it to support its team unlike any other offensive Pok&eacute;mon found in OU. It even has access to Fake Out, which allows it to freely Mega Evolve and deal chip damage. All these traits make it a top-tier threat that every team needs to watch out for.</p>

<p>Lopunny @ Lopunnite<br />
Ability: Limber<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- High Jump Kick<br />
- Return<br />
- Fake Out / Ice Punch<br />
- Toxic / Healing Wish / Heal Bell</p>

<p>This is Lopunny's most used and most consistent set. High Jump Kick has a great Base Power and can be spammed without worry thanks to Scrappy, though you may need to watch out for Pok&eacute;mon with Protect such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Return hits every Ghost-type that resists High Jump Kick neutrally, which gives Lopunny its coveted two STAB perfect coverage. In the third slot, Fake Out is there for chip damage and getting a free turn to Mega Evolve, but Ice Punch is an option to hit the likes of Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor hard. However, both of Lopunny's STAB moves hit harder neutrally than a 2x super effective Ice Punch, so it only good for the aforementioned Pok&eacute;mon. The last slot is dedicated entirely to team support. Toxic wears down the Pok&eacute;mon that wall Lopunny such as Mew, Slowbro, and Cresselia, while Healing Wish allows Lopunny to sacrifice itself and heal a teammate once its job is fulfilled. Finally, Heal Bell works to remove Lopunny's own status, as well as that of its teammates. All are viable options, so once again, it depends on what your team needs.</p>

<p><strong>Glalie<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 80 / 80 / 80 / 80 / 80 / 80<br />
Mega: 80 / 120 / 80 / 120 / 80 / 100</strong></p>

<p>Similar to Pidgeot, Beedrill, and Lopunny, Glalie has always been an irrelevant Pok&eacute;mon in the competitive scene. Lackluster base 80 stats across the board and a terrible defensive typing left Glalie rotting at the bottom of the pit. Game Freak changed this with its Mega Evolution and turned it from a mediocre Spiker into a powerful wallbreaker. Access to Refrigerate, Double Edge, and Explosion allow Glalie to hit extremely hard, as Double Edge 2HKOes Skarmory. It even has access to Freeze Dry to hit the bulky Water-types that would otherwise wall it. However, Glalie is still plagued with mediocre bulk, average at best Speed, and a terrible defensive typing. Glalie should rarely be your first choice for a Mega slot, but if you need a nuke, Glalie's your man&mdash;err, face.</p>

<p>Glalie @ Glalitite<br />
Ability: Inner Focus<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant / Naughty Nature<br />
- Double Edge<br />
- Ice Shard<br />
- Earthquake / Freeze-Dry<br />
- Explosion</p>

<p>Glalie needs all the power it can get to fully abuse Refridgerate. Double Edge is the STAB move of choice, as the power is well worth the recoil damage and Glalie's nonexistent bulk means it won't be staying around long anyways. Ice Shard is there to revenge kill Choice Scarfers and faster threats in general. Earthquake is a good option to hit the Steel- and Fire-types that otherwise resist its STAB moves, but Freeze Dry along with a Naughty nature allows it to get past bulky Water-types easier. Finally, Explosion is the last move that lets you nuke whatever is facing Glalie. Literally. Even resists take enough damage to strip off over 50% of their health, which allows a teammate to clean up the mess with relative ease.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/latios-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Latios<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 80 / 90 / 80 / 130 / 110 / 110<br />
Mega: 80 / 130 / 100 / 160 / 120 / 110</strong></p>

<p>Upon first look, a Pok&eacute;mon with Mega Latios's stats just screams Ubers. However, that simply isn't the case, because normal Latios outclasses Mega Latios outside of gimmicky Dragon Dance sets. Life Orb Latios hits harder than Mega Latios, and more importantly, doesn't take up your Mega Evolution slot. This, along with the fact that Life Orb Latias is just as bulky and hits as hard as Mega Latios, means that Mega Latios should really only be used if you haven't yet used up your Mega Slot. Mega Latios isn't bad, but his opportunity cost prevents him from seeing the light of day more often than not.</p>

<p>Latios @ Latiosite<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Psyshock <br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Roost / Defog</p>

<p>If you choose to use Mega Latios, this is the set you should run. He works exactly like regular Life Orb Latios except with more bulk and less power. The only difference is that Earthquake is more powerful thanks to a base 130 Attack, meaning that Heatran, Jirachi, and Bisharp are no longer safe switch-ins, where previously Latios almost always lost to them. The choice between Defog and Roost depends on what your team needs. Roost is the overall better option, as it takes advantage of Mega Latios's increased bulk and increases his staying power. However, Defog is viable if your team struggles with entry hazards.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/latias-mega.gif" alt=""/>

<p><strong>Latias<br />
Base Stats<br />
Base Form: 80 / 80 / 90 / 110 / 130 / 110<br />
Mega: 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 / 150 / 110</strong></p>

<p>Last on the list, but by no means the least, we have Mega Latias. Latias received huge buffs to both her Special Attack and her defenses. Unlike her brother, Mega Latias has a niche over her base forme in that she can take on the role of a bulky Calm Mind sweeper thanks to her insane bulk and access to Stored Power. This is really only Mega Latias's niche, but she's so effective at it that based on this set alone, Mega Latias has earned an A ranking on the OU Viability Rankings thread.</p>

<p>Latias @ Latiasite<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 204 Def / 56 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Roost<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Stored Power</p>

<p>This set acts as a great mid- to late-game sweeper, as once Dark-types have been removed, very little can stop Latias from setting up. Calm Mind and Substitute allow her to boost and protect herself from status, while Roost is used to keep her healthy. After just a few Calm Minds, Stored Power becomes insanely powerful and only the bulkiest of resists can stand up to it. However, Mega Latias needs quite a bit of support to pull this off. First and foremost, she absolutely needs Dark-types to be removed. It doesn't matter how many boosts you get if you can't damage your foe, it's all for naught. Secondly, Mega Latias is extreme Taunt bait. Her naturally high Speed allows her to outpace some of the slower users of Taunt with the given Speed investment, but stallbreaker Gliscor and especially Gengar are still capable of shutting this set down. However, once you remove everything you need to, not even Calm Mind Clefable can stand in her way.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>XY has come to a close, and the metagame that everyone knows and loves is no longer with us. ORAS introduced new move tutors and new Mega Evolutions, which drastically changed the metagame, for better or for worse. I have gone over all of the Mega Evolutions legal in OU (shout out to Mega Salamence for being quickbanned, and especially Mega Rayquaza for being the first Pok&eacute;mon banned from Ubers) that were introduced in the Ruby and Sapphire remakes, and have explained how they work and what their best sets are. I hope that you will use this article as a guide along with your experience from XY to take on this fresh new metagame. Thanks for reading, and have a nice day.</p>
