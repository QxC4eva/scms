<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises the power of Water-type moves 20% when this item is held.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In battle, Mystic Water performs almost exactly like <a href="/dp/items/wave_incense">Wave Incense</a>. The only difference is how these items affect the Base Power of the move <a href="/dp/moves/fling">Fling</a>; Wave Incense makes Fling's Base Power 10 while Mystic Water makes it 30. Due to this, Wave Incense is marginally better (unless the Pokemon holding it uses Fling) because opponents employing the extremely rare Trick/Thief + Fling strategy will deal slightly less damage when they Fling your item. For information on the competitive use of this item, see the Wave Incense description.</p>
