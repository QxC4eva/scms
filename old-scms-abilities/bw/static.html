30% chance to paralyze when struck by a contact move.

[LONG DESC] 
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder has a 30% chance of inducing paralysis on a Pokemon that connects with a contact move. Static has a separate chance of activation on each hit of a contact multi-hit move, and can status a Pokemon multiple times if the first status is removed by the effect of <a href="/bw/items/lum_berry">Lum Berry</a> or similar items. Static is prevented by <a href="/bw/moves/safeguard">Safeguard</a>, but not by <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a>.

<p>When the wielder is first in the party, wild encounters with Electric Pokemon have a higher chance of occurring.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Static is a pretty widespread ability, yet no real standout Pokemon get it. <a href="/bw/pokemon/manectric">Manectric</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/raichu">Raichu</a> are perhaps the most notable, but would much prefer to use <a href="/bw/abilities/lightningrod">Lightningrod</a> to gain a Special Attack boost. In any case, most Pokemon that have Static cannot take a physical hit anyway, so its use is very limited.</p>
