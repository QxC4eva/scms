<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prevents any move that targets the user from taking effect for the turn it is used in. Does not prevent passive damage such as sandstorm or poison. This attack has a 1/X chance of being successful, where X starts at 1 and doubles each time this move is successfully used. X resets to 1 if this attack fails or if the user's last used move is not Detect, Endure, Protect, Quick Guard, or Wide Guard. If X is 256 or more, this move has a 1/(2^32) chance of being successful. Fails if the user moves last this turn. This move has a priority of +4.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In singles, Protect is literally THE stalling move. Its main purpose is to waste a turn, though it can also be helpful for scouting out dangerous moves that the opponent may use. Wasting a turn is very helpful for taking full advantage of the many end-of-turn effects in the game. It can mean more residual damage from the likes of Toxic, Sandstorm, Hail, Leech Seed, and burn, or free Wish healing, or more benefit from ability-based effects, such as Speed Boost, Poison Heal, and Rain Dish. For example, Tentacruel can potentially heal 1/4 of its HP in rain (including the Leftovers recovery) before getting hit at all, while Sharpedo, Yanmega, or Blaziken can grab a Speed Boost to make themselves extremely difficult to revenge kill.</p>

<p>In VGC and triples, Protect is a much more universally strategic move, because it is not limited to wasting a turn. A focused attack from the opponent on one Pokemon can be exploited by using Protect, rendering the opponent's turn completely wasted while the Protect user's teammates are free to use their moves. Of course, the downside is that the Protect user is still left doing nothing else, so a mistimed Protect can be disastrous. Protect can also be used to shield the user from spread attacks like Earthquake and Surf that are used by one of its teammates.</p>
