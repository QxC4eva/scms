<h2>Projects</h2>

<p><strong><a href="/forums/threads/o...s.3523692/">NU Viability Ranking</a></strong> is a project designed to help those new to NU learn about what Pokemon experienced players find to be effective. NU players rank Pokemon based on how well they perform in the tier, which can be seen in the first post of the thread. Generally, good Pokemon will generate discussion about why they are good in NU and what sets or characteristics make them so potent. Likewise, for bad Pokemon, discussion within this thread help explain why they're not effective, why they fail, and the numerous issues they have, which will result in them being ranked lower.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/forums/threads/o...3.3525845/">NU Research Week #7</a></strong> is a project that looks at underrated / unexplored Pokemon. A new Research Week is posted around every week and usually four Pokemon are designated to be researched. Players can discuss and post sets that they think are effective or interesting. The Pokemon in the latest Research Group are Heliolisk, Mawile, Quagsire, and Virizion. </p>
<p><strong><a href="/forums/threads/c...o.3523498/">Counter That Threat! [Week 6: Mawile]</a></strong> is a project that discusses a way to counter a Pokemon that the topic creator chooses. This week's threat is Mawile.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/forums/threads/oras-nu-teambuilding-compilation.3523819/">NeverUsed Teambuilding Compilation</a></strong> is a project that gives new users an opportunity to observe and better understand how experienced NU players go about building their teams around certain Pokemon.
