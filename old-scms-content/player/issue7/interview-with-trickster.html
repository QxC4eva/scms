        <p>It was a cold winter day here in New Jersey. The weather was dreadful, but I spent it outside chatting with a girl I just met and lent her my jacket. Things were going well until I got a call from Antemortem. The girl I was speaking to laughed at my MegaMan ringtone and left me all alone in the snow with no jacket, but whatever. I had more important things to focus on.</p>

        <p>Antemortem said to me in the call, "Interview Trickster, now."</p>

        <p>By his tone of voice, I could tell that this was urgent, so I grabbed the next train to Missouri. After I dealt with an old lady who needed my help, some babies who wouldn't stop crying, and this dude who tripped me (it was on purpose, I swear; I could see the look in his eyes), I finally reached my destination. It was still snowing hard at that point, but my determination kept me going. I reached the biggest synagogue (a Jewish church) around and entered it. I looked around and saw Trickster over by his family, praying. Upon closer inspection, however, I noticed he was texting me repeatedly "GET ME OUT OF THIS PLACE!" I hadn't even realized my phone had been vibrating this whole time. Oh well; I pulled him aside, and we began.</p>

            <p>Hey, Trickster! Glad to be here.</p>
        </div>

            <p>Hello, Spy, it's good to see you could make it.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>So, what kind of person would you consider yourself to be outside of PS?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker trickster">
        <img src="/player/issue7/interview_trickster.png" alt="Trickster" />
        <div>
            <p>I'm somewhat introverted and usually pretty quiet, especially around people I don't know. Most of the time I like to do my own thing. I suppose I could call myself an otaku, although I don't feel like I emulate that through how I act on PS.</p>

            <p>For those who don't know, an otaku is someone who's so interested in computers or popular culture that it overshadows their social life. It has a negative connotation, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't describe me. However, that doesn't mean I have no social life outside of PS.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="aside">
        <p>Huh, I guess you learn something new every day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" >
        <div>
            <p>That's pretty interesting! By that, I assume you're an anime fan. What else do you enjoy doing other than coming on PS?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker trickster">
        <img src="/player/issue7/interview_trickster.png" alt="Trickster" />
        <div>
            <p>Yeah, I'm a big anime fan. I also enjoy playing the piano and clarinet, which I play in my school's marching band during the fall. My parents try to get me involved in Jewish youth groups and stuff, but I'm not too interested in those for the most part.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>Yeah, band can be a lot of fun from my experience. How did you first get involved with Pok&eacute;mon and PS in general?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker trickster">
        <img src="/player/issue7/interview_trickster.png" alt="Trickster" />
        <div>
            <p>I've always loved Pok&eacute;mon, starting with the anime back when Hoenn was airing. I also collected the cards for a while without really knowing how to play. I didn't actually play any of the Pok&eacute;mon games until about four years ago, when I played FireRed on an emulator.</p>

            <p>I first heard of PS when I became interested in Wi-Fi battling after playing White 2. I, of course, used Smogon sets and found out about the site that way but didn't join until I went over to my friend's house and saw his friend playing random battles on the sim. The idea of using random Pok&eacute;mon to battle was exciting, so when I got home that night, I made an account and played a lot of random battles.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="aside">
        <p>Random battles seem to draw everyone to PS, especially now that Gen 1 random battles are a thing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>When did you decide to switch to chat rooms, and how did you get involved in them?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker trickster">
        <img src="/player/issue7/interview_trickster.png"  alt="Trickster" />
        <div>
            <p>The reason I started getting involved in rooms was a bit dumb. At the time, the Trivia room offered room Voice to those who achieved "Hatmor" status, which was getting 150 points through answering questions correctly. I considered myself pretty knowledgeable about Pok&eacute;mon facts, so when I saw this in the room description, I thought it would be an easy way to get Voice. Back then, I wasn't fully aware of what Voice was or that there was a difference between global and room ranks, but being at the top of the user list with a + next to my name looked good to me.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>Seems like you learned that soon enough, seeing that you're room Owner of Trivia now. When did you start getting involved globally and with the Lobby? You're pretty famous around those parts.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker trickster">
        <img src="/player/issue7/interview_trickster.png"  alt="Trickster" />
        <div>
            <p>I actually know the exact date I started going in Lobby. It was January 21st, 2014, the day when Jasmine wreaked havoc on the Lobby through his declares about pineapple pizza. Coronis, one of the ROs of Trivia, was jokingly demoted to Voice, so I went into the Lobby to see what was going on.</p>

            <p>I figured if the Lobby was this much fun every day, then I should start going there more often. I also owned a server at the time and had gotten more used to the chaotic environment, so it wasn't quite as overwhelming as it would've been if I hadn't been exposed to it before.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="aside">
        <p>I was there for that, and I can tell you that wasn't even close to one of Lobby's craziest moments. It's quite the room.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>Yeah, the Lobby can be quite&hellip; interesting at its peak times. What advice would you give to a user who is looking to get involved with the Lobby and trying to chat? A lot of people get turned off by how their messages get drowned out.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker trickster">
        <img src="/player/issue7/interview_trickster.png" alt="Trickster" />
        <div>
            <p>Usually, in the midst of all the unrelated comments and trolling there's some central conversation going on. Just do your best to ignore the dumb stuff that people say and maintain that topic, and the room can be a lot of fun. Lobby is used to talk about a lot of things; it's PS's general room, so it won't always be Pok&eacute;mon either.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>That's great! Alright, to end things off, I need to ask: Why did you change your name as often as you did? You effectively made the Church of Sunako and the names "Dickster" and "Truckster" fall into oblivion.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker trickster">
        <img src="/player/issue7/interview_trickster.png" alt="Trickster" />
        <div>
            <p>Well, I was originally just going to change it to Comet and that would have been the end of things. However, when I went on IRC to ask Zarel to reset the name's password, the person who had Comet registered was in the IRC chat, so that didn't really work out. So I changed to Sunako because I was hyped over the anime <em>Shiki</em> and had already made a sprite to go along with the name. I also had over 1900 Elo in Random Battles on that account.</p>

            <p>However, I quickly became tired of the comments about my sprite, PMs asking if I was a girl, and the "ok anus" jokes. I also stopped caring as much about the anime the name originated from.</p>

            <p>I decided to change a second time to a name that matched an entire archetype of anime characters that I liked, such as Izaya Orihara. I also liked the character Loki in the Thor movies, so that played a role in the change. Overall, I thought the name would act as a reminder to myself during moderating to just have fun and not take things too seriously.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="aside">
        <p>Wow, I could tell he really cared about his username and what it symbolized. Around that point though, Trickster's parents realized he wasn't there praying.</p>
    </div>

        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>That's pretty neat! It makes me feel bad that my username was me trying to be funny with a pun, lol. Regardless, it seems like my time here is up, so thanks for allowing me to interview you!</p>

    <div class="aside">
        <p>I quietly snuck out of the synagogue into the cold world. There weren't any trains for a while, so I was stuck there in the freezing cold without a jacket&hellip;</p>
