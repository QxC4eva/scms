<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals the user by 1/2 of its maximum HP, rounded half up.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Slack Off is an excellent move, but not all of the Pokemon with access to it can use it effectively. The Infernape family, with their little bulk, can rarely afford to take a turn to heal, and should spend the turn attacking or setting up. Slaking and Slakoth can not afford to use this move due to their awful ability in Truant. Every other Pokemon who receives Slack Off is primarily used as a wall, and can utilize Slack Off to keep themselves alive and stall out the opponent with ease. This is especially true on Slowbro and Slowking, as the combined healing effects of Regenerator and Slack Off can allow the two to recover health incredibly easily.</p>
