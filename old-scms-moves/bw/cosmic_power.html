<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Defense and Special Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Cosmic Power is a Psychic-type move that boosts both defenses at the same time, so it's more used on defensively inclined sets. One of the best users is Sigilyph, thanks to a combination of Magic Guard, Psycho Shift, Roost, and Stored Power, which enables it to bypass some of its would-be counters. Clefable can work similarly. Other niche users are Jirachi, and some specific Arceus forms like Bug, Steel, and Poison. However, in general it isn't worth the trouble to use this move. The level of power that you are likely to encounter is so great that one boost is unlikely to protect you, and the time taken to make yourself sufficiently impenetrable can allow your opponents to severely injure your Pokemon or even set up themselves. Furthermore, without increased offensive power, the kind of bulky threats that use this move are unlikely to be able to break other defensive threats, so cannot sweep effectively, and are also likely to be worn down over time by repeated attacks. This is the reason why those with access to Stored Power, such as Sigilyph, are more effective with this strategy, as Stored Power's Base Power increases depending on the number of boosts accumulated, which suits Cosmic Power's nature.</p>
