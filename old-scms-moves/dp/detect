[SHORT DESC]
Prevents most moves from working on the user that turn.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Protects the user from most moves during the turn. If the user successfully used Detect, Endure, or Protect on the previous turn, Detect only has a 50% chance to work successfully. If the Detect user moves last in a turn, Detect fails.</p>

<p>Feint ends Detect's protection and damages the Detect user. Lock-On, Mind Reader, and No Guard give moves (100 minus accuracy)% chance to hit through Detect. OHKO moves (Horn Drill, Guillotine, Fissure, and Sheer Cold) are always blocked by Detect, even with Lock-On, Mind Reader, or No Guard. Thunder has a 30% chance to hit through Detect in the rain, as does Blizzard in hail.</p>
