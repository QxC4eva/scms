<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to confuse the target. In rain, this move has 100% accuracy. In sun, this move has 50% accuracy. This move can hit a Pokemon using Bounce, Fly, and Sky Drop.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Hurricane is an excellent move for rain sweepers. It is powerful and has excellent coverage, but poor distribution. Tornadus, Tornadus-T, and Dragonite are the best users of this move, which becomes 100% accurate in rain, but interestingly enough, Volcarona can use Hurricane as well. That said, Hurricane should not be used outside rain, as its accuracy becomes extremely unreliable.</p>
