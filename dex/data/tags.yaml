        Tier Composition
        ================
        
        Ubers is the most inclusive of Smogon's tiers, allowing the use of any Pokémon              species. Only abilities and tactics which have been proven to be uncompetitive are          banned from use. Ubers is not influenced by Pokémon usage in OU, UU, RU, or NU, and         the usage of Pokémon in Ubers has no influence on the composition of those tiers.
