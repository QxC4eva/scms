    <p>A little over a month ago we released issue #22 and announced that we were leaving behind the bi-monthly release system in favor of a month-to-month schedule. With this, issue #23, we are commencing this cycle. Packed with close to 40 articles, issue #23 is one of the biggest we have ever put together, and I personally like it a lot. Seeing how with our recent changes in the management system we have been able to produce so much content in such a short period of time is a testament to the levels of the efficiency and organization at the core of our teams at The Smog &mdash; big round of applause to all of our contributors!</p>
    <p>There are a lot of cool articles this time around, and that includes The Smog Awards, our popular annual contest. Judge a Pokemon is also making its entrance back into the scene after taking a short break for the last couple of months. Type Analysis, Featured RMTs and Featured Pokemon, the Interview and the Arterview, and The Competitor are some of the titles that power this issue, and there is a lot more that Iâ€™m not going to cover in this post but rather let you, our readers, discover them on your own! </p>
    <p>Aside from the above, you will also notice how The Smog is entering this holiday season with a new look and feel in sections such as the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/smog/">main page</a> and the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/smog/issue23/">issues</a> themselves (starting with #23), although the rest of the magazine has received some nice improvements as well. <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/member.php?u=30562">Toast</a> and I decided that it would be cool to have a new design ready with this release, as The Smog had been wearing the old outfit for far too long and it was just time to do something about that. But, don't think we're stopping here; you can expect much more this coming year, as we hope to make some dramatic changes to the magazine in the technical front.</p>
    <p>Play with the new changes, make use of everything we've brought to you with this release, and don't forget to head over to our <a href="/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=79">forum</a> once you are done and leave us a note &mdash; we want to hear what you think! We hope that you enjoy reading this issue as much as we enjoyed making it. And on behalf of The Smog team, we wish you a very Happy Holiday season!</p>
