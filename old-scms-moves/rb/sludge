<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Has a 29.7% chance to poison the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sludge is the best Poison-type move, but it's not seen often since Poison-types are very bad competitively, defeated by the ever-present Earthquake and Psychic; moreover, Poison-types with dual types, such as Venusaur, get better STAB moves. Additionally, most Grass-types have a secondary typing, mostly Poison itself, so there's not many Pokemon you can hit super effectively with it as opposed to other options.</p>
