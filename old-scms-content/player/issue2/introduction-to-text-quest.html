<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As the name implies, here in TextQuest we play a text-based RPG which primarily focuses on quests in the chat! The possibilities throughout the game are endless, as you can customize your character, choose from 5 different classes, earn gold and experience points, and battle the enemies of the world of TextQuest alongside friends!</p>

<h2>Starting off</h2>

<p>When you decide that you want to become involved with the world of TextQuest, there are two things that you should do to start off:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Highlight the phrase "questsignup" by entering the command "/highlight add, questsignup". This is the phrase stated whenever a host decides that they want to host a quest in order to call all of the users of the room together to see who would like to participate.</li>
    <li>Choose a class. Of course, if you want to start participating, you need to choose a class to play with. Once you have decided, PM any ranked user with your class to be added to the userlist and hop into the world of TextQuest!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stats</h2>
<p>Before you jump into choosing a class, you might want to learn about the 5 main stats that every character has and their effect on your abilities:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>HP</dt>
    <dd>Also known as hit points, this is basically your health in a quest, and once it hits zero, you are dead.</dd>
   
    <dt>Attack</dt>
    <dd>The stat that calculates how much damage you will do with your attacks.</dd>
   
    <dt>Defense</dt>
    <dd>The stat that allows you to nullify enemy attacks (damage is calculated by the Attack roll minus the Defense of person being attacked).</dd>
   
    <dt>Energy</dt>
    <dd>This allows you to perform the many skills you have up your belt, but if it's at zero, then you can't attack.</dd>
   
    <dt>Speed</dt>
    <dd>This stat determines attacking order, but if all users have the same Speed, the class order (Priest, Rogue, Archer, Mage, Warrior) is used. If people happen to have the same Speed and class, then it is done alphabetically. Speed also allows you to attack the enemy more than once based on how fast you are compared to the enemy. You attack two times if you are 50% faster, and three times if you are more than double the enemy's Speed!</dd>
</dl>

<p>Keep in mind that at level 1, all stats are set at 15. Once you level up, you get 7 stat points to add to whatever stats you want. Every level has a stat cap, so you can't dump all of your points into one stat.</p>

<h2>The Classes</h2>

<p>Now that you know about the stats, it's time to choose a class! Here are explanations of the 5 different classes to choose from, each one having its strengths and weaknesses:</p>

<div id="class-container">
    <div class="class" style="border: 3px solid #A3CCCC; background-color: #DAEBEB">
        <h3 class="class-title">The Priest</h3>
        <p class="class-desc">This is the main support class for your team.</p>
        <p class="class-boost"><strong>Level Up Boost:</strong> HP</p>
        <p class="class-strength"><strong>Strength:</strong> They have the ability to heal other characters and provide stat boosts throughout the quest.</p>
        <p class="class-weakness"><strong>Weakness:</strong> They have a weak damage output.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="class" style="border: 3px solid #000033; background-color: #9999AD">
        <h3 class="class-title">The Rogue</h3>
        <p class="class-desc">This class focuses on powerful and residual (damage over time) attacks.</p>
        <p class="class-boost"><strong>Level Up Boost:</strong> Attack</p>
        <p class="class-strength"><strong>Strength:</strong> They have a large damage output.</p>
        <p class="class-weakness"><strong>Weakness:</strong> They depend a lot on their Attack stat, making the other stats relatively weaker.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="class" style="border: 3px solid #008000; background-color: #99CC99">
        <h3 class="class-title">The Archer</h3>
        <p class="class-desc">This class focuses on getting in fast hits and can be well rounded.</p>
        <p class="class-boost"><strong>Level Up Boost:</strong> Speed</p>
        <p class="class-strength"><strong>Strength:</strong> They move first to get in fast, strong hits on the enemy.</p>
        <p class="class-weakness"><strong>Weakness:</strong> They are a bit too reliant on Speed and can get crushed if the enemy is faster.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="class" style="border: 3px solid #A30000; background-color: #DA9999">
        <h3 class="class-title">The Warrior</h3>
        <p class="class-desc">This class is the main defensive class, yet it can still dish out powerful hits.</p>
        <p class="class-boost"><strong>Level Up Boost:</strong> Defense</p>
        <p class="class-strength"><strong>Strength:</strong> They are bulky and can take many enemy attacks.</p>
        <p class="class-weakness"><strong>Weakness:</strong> They can't take True Damage hits very well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="class" style="border: 3px solid #CC0052; background-color: #EB99BA">
        <h3 class="class-title">The Dark Mage</h3>
        <p class="class-desc">This class focuses on utilizing True Damage, which ignores Defense.</p>
        <p class="class-boost"><strong>Level Up Boost:</strong> Energy</p>
        <p class="class-strength"><strong>Strength:</strong> They have a variety of attacks that utilize true damage to its maximum potential.</p>
        <p class="class-weakness"><strong>Weakness:</strong> They need to invest boosts in 4 to 5 of their stats to accomplish this.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Remember to check out the skill trees for each class before choosing in order to get a feel for what kinds of attacks each class has.</p>

<h2>Terms</h2>

<div class="float-right"><img src="/player/issue2/textquest_bottom.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Now that you've picked a class based on what role you want to play in a quest, there are some important terms that you should learn before jumping into your first quest:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>True Damage</dt>
    <dd>Damage done from an attack that ignores the opponent's Defense stat.</dd>
   
    <dt>Tier</dt>
    <dd>When a quest is in sign ups, the host will choose people of the same tier to fight against the boss. Tiers are in 3 level increments (1-3, 4-6, etc.). This is to ensure that the boss that the host chooses is at the right level of difficulty for all of the members of the quest.</dd>

    <dt>Subclass</dt>
    <dd>At level 15, you gain specialized roles for your class called subclasses. These allow your playstyle to differ from the overall class, but it still ties into the class's main ideas.</dd>
   
    <dt>Area of Effect</dt>
    <dd>An attack that damages all players.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Now that you have chosen a class, familiarized yourself with basic game mechanics, and have highlighted "questsignup", you are ready to start participating in your own quest! Any ranked user has the ability to start a quest, so just ask one of them politely and I'm sure that they will oblige! For any further questions, PM one of the room auth. Good luck, and happy questing!</p>
