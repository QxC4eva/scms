[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Opposing Steel-type Pokemon cannot switch out while the wielder is on the field. A Steel-type Pokemon can escape by using <a href="/bw/moves/baton_pass">Baton Pass</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/u-turn">U-turn</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/volt_switch">Volt Switch</a> (as long as the wielder isn't immune to Volt Switch), or by holding the item <a href="/bw/items/shed_shell">Shed Shell</a>. Magnet Pull does not prevent the effect of <a href="/bw/items/eject_button">Eject Button</a>.</p>

<p>When the wielder is first in the party, the chance of wild encounters with Steel-type Pokemon occurring is increased.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>A great ability, simply for the fact that Steel-types are so common, and so dangerous, in OU. <a href="/bw/pokemon/magnezone">Magnezone</a> can trap <a href="/bw/pokemon/ferrothorn">Ferrrothorn</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/scizor">Scizor</a>, and then either set up on it or KO it to allow another Pokemon to sweep. <a href="/bw/pokemon/magneton">Magneton</a> can do the same job viably too due to its higher Speed, and is available in the lower tiers. <a href="/bw/pokemon/probopass">Probopass</a>, however, is fairly terrible and can't do anything besides keeping the Steel-type on the field.</p>
