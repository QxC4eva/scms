<p>A Topic Leader is the head of an individual Pokémon creation project. It is one of the most respected leadership positions on the CAP project. Powers and responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>

<li>Determine the slate of submissions for certain polls</li>
<li>Encourage participation</li>
</ul>

<p>A new Topic Leader is chosen for each new Pokémon creation project. All Topic Leader candidates self-nominate in a nomination thread created at the start of a Pokémon creation project. Nominees should make their "pitch" in a self-nomination post. Individual community members can express support for a given candidate by posting in the nomination thread. Posts disparaging candidates are discouraged.</p>

<p><strong>Topic Leaders and Moderators</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moderators will open threads for each part of the process. Threads made by moderators start closed. The TL will be the first reply in every non-poll thread, and after their post the TL will unlock the thread for further discussion.</li>
<li>The TL will close project threads with their slate.</li>
<li>The TL is expected to maintain contact with moderators and alert them to any upcoming absences when possible, so that the CAP project can keep pace.</li>
</ul>
