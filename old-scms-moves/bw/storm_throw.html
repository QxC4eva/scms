<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 100% chance to land a critical hit. Pokemon under the effect of Lucky Chant or with the abilities Battle Armor or Shell Armor cannot be critical hit but will take damage as normal.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Storm Throw is the signature move of Throh. While at first it might seem pointless to have a move that always lands a critical hit instead of a move with simply twice its Base Power, Storm Throw does have one advantage: it essentially provides Throh an 80 Base Power STAB move that ignores the opponent's Defense boosts. When combined with Throh's respectable physical bulk, Storm Throw allows it to win wars with other Bulk Up or Curse boosters by using Bulk Up alongside them, and ignoring their efforts to boost their Defense.</p>
