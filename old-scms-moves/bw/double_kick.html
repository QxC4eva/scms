Hits 2 times in one turn.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and always hits twice unless the target is KOed by the first hit. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate twice, and this move can KO through Focus Sash and Sturdy. If the first hit breaks a Substitute, the attack will continue to damage the target. Each hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. If the target holds a Chople, Jaboca, or Enigma Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat both hits as a single attack, and Color Change will only activate on the second hit of the move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Double Kick is a move that hits twice on the same turn. Theoretically it would be useful for breaking Substitutes, but differently from Double Hit, a Normal-type clone, it has no real users to take advantage of it. Thus, it's very rarely seen in competitive battles and is simply too weak to warrant any use at all.</p>
