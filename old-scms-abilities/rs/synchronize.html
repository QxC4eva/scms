[SHORT DESC]
When statused, the enemy is also statused. Can pass nature to wild Pokémon.
[LONG DESC]
<p>If another Pokémon inflicts burn, paralysis, or poison on the ability-bearer, then the enemy receives the status as well. Toxic poison is passed on as regular poison. Self-induced status is not passed on.</p>

<p>When a Pokémon with this ability is first in the party (even if it is fainted) when entering battle against a wild Pokémon, there is a 50% chance of making the wild Pokémon's nature correspond to the nature of the Pokémon with this ability. This effect does not work with legendary Pokémon.</p>
