<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Bug-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed during the damage calculation. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Bug-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Tanga Berry, besides having a slightly promiscuous name (tanga means thong in Spanish), is one of the rarely used type-resist Berries, as the only common Bug-type move, U-turn, only has 70 base power. One Pokemon that can make good use of this Berry is Celebi, which is the only OU Pokemon with a 4x weakness to Bug-type moves. Coupled with its good Defense and access to boosting moves such as Nasty Plot and Calm Mind, Celebi can make good use of the item by surviving a move easily and setting up a sweep. However, it is usually outclassed by Life Orb and Leftovers, as the power or healing boost is almost always better than surviving an attack once, a problem that nearly always leaves Tanga Berry on the sidelines.</p>
