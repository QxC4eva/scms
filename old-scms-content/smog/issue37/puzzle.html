<p>
	Welcome back to our second Puzzle Page! We had lots of favorable feedback last issue, so we're upping the ante this issue with more parameter puzzles, more mystery sounds, and a harder crossword. As always, we're open to feedback; if there's some type of puzzle you'd like to see included next issue, or if you have a gripe with this issue's puzzles, feel free to send a VM to Level 51 or air your opinion in the feedback poll or release thread.
</p>

<p>
	Before we start, let's extend our congratulations to our six winners from last issue! Lyto and KS2 came in tops in the Mystery Sound competition, while Knuckstrike, Geodude6, and Cattail Prophet won in the Parameter Puzzles. Please contact an Administrator to sort out your custom title. Finally, congratulations to Quanyails for being the first user to win a Custom Avatar through our Puzzle Page! We'll be contacting you about your prize shortly. As for all of our other readers, if you're just curious about the answers for last issue's puzzles, you can find them on the same page as the questions <a href="/smog/issue36/puzzle">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Parameter Puzzles</h2>
<p>
	Your challenge for these questions is to obtain the given list of Pokemon from the /dexsearch command on Pokemon Showdown! using the correct number of parameters as shown! Note that "all" does not count as a parameter. Can you figure out which parameters were used to obtain these results?
</p>

<p>
	Use the command "/dexsearch" for a quick introduction on how the command works. The first three users to send in all 15 correct answers will earn themselves a custom title on the Smogon Forums; failing which, the first three users with the highest scores will earn these custom titles instead!
</p>

<h2>Mystery Sound</h2>
<p>
	Do you consider yourself a well-traveled denizen of the Pok&eacute;mon world, able to recognize a tune from just a few bars of sound? Well, this is the challenge for you! Simply guess which of the main Pok&eacute;mon games and from which location in the game this clip comes from. The first two users to send in all three correct answers will win themselves a custom title on the Smogon Forums!

	And here we have it: the grand finale to this issue's Puzzle Page! To participate, simply fill out the crossword grid below with what you believe are the right answers, and send a screenshot of the grid to us.
