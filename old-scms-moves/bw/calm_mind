<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts user's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Calm Mind is a move that is frequently seen competitively; this is largely because it is the best well-distributed move with which to boost Special Attack, as Nasty Plot and Quiver Dance are somewhat poorly distributed. Calm Mind's defensive boosts offer an opportunity to set up on a plethora of special attackers, and can make a Pokemon with heavy investment in physical Defense very hard to take down. Reuniclus, Latias, Latios, and Virizion are examples of Calm Mind users; Reuniclus and Latias are generally more defensive, while Latios generally uses the offensive boost to hit hard rather than trying to set up numerous Calm Minds. Notably, Calm Mind is seen often enough that one can often find oneself in a "Calm Mind war," where two opposing Pokemon with Calm Mind will both boost to +6 simultaneously; usually, the Pokemon to win will be the one which gets a critical hit first, though one can certainly tip the odds in one's favor through the use of Psyshock or Roar. Overall, Calm Mind users can be extremely dangerous, especially if they are the last Pokemon on the team and as such cannot be phazed. Every team that is somewhat defensively inclined must find a way of dealing with them.</p>
