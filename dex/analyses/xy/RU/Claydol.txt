Overview
########

Claydol is one of the most niche Pokemon in RU. Its only spot on a team is as a spinner that can outlast many spinblockers with Toxic. Essentially, it is Gligar with a bit more Special Defense and Rapid Spin instead of Defog. It is also very slow and has weaknesses to Ghost-, Dark-, Water-, Grass-, Bug-, and Ice-type attacks. Additionally, having a weakness to Knock Off is a huge detriment as is being weak to the STAB type of all spinblockers. It also has no way of dealing significant damage outside of Toxic, as its Special Attack is very low. However, Claydol has a good ability, support movepool, defensive stats, and doesn't care about any kind of entry hazard. It resists Stealth Rock and is immune to all other entry hazards, making it easy to switch in and out without taking too much damage. Claydol also has the bonus of being able to fit Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin on the same set, and it has an easier time dealing with Electric-types than Gligar. Just note that Claydol's cons generally outweigh its pros and that its niche is very small, so it should not find a place on many competitive teams.

Moves
========

Rapid Spin should always be used on Claydol, as removing hazards without much worry is Claydol's main niche. Stealth Rock is recommended in the second slot as it can whittle down Pokemon that switch in, but if you have another Stealth Rock setter, it can be omitted in favor of Protect, which allows Claydol to get a bit more Leftovers recovery and stall for Toxic damage. Earth Power is a reliable STAB move and is preferred over Earthquake to help against Doublade, one of the few spinblockers Claydol can beat. Toxic is recommended in the last slot to stall out spinblockers and other walls, and it can also put opposing sweepers on a timer. Psyshock can be used in the last slot to hit Fighting-types harder.

Set Details
========

The HP EVs provide the best Leftovers number for Claydol and rounds down Stealth Rock damage, as it is an odd number. Leftovers are for the residual recovery and can turn some 2HKOs into 3HKOs. It also makes Claydol less vulnerable to Stealth Rock and status, such as poison and burn. Special Defense is maximized so Claydol can handle special attackers more easily. The rest of the EVs are placed in Defense to take miscellaneous physical hits a tiny bit better. Alternately, if Psyshock is chosen as the last move, a spread of 240 HP / 80 Def / 8 SpA / 180 SpD can be used to survive a Knock Off from Hitmonlee and be able to OHKO back after Stealth Rock and a turn of Life Orb recoil. The HP EVs provide the best Leftovers number and the rest is placed in Special Defense.

Usage Tips
========

You usually should not use Claydol, as it is heavily outclassed and has a very small niche, but if you do choose to use it, you should spin away entry hazards whenever possible and set up Stealth Rock using its decent bulk. Prediction might be needed if the opponent has Doublade on their team, as Claydol can 2HKO it with Earth Power. If the opponent has other Ghost-types that can potentially block the Rapid Spin, then using Toxic as they switch in is ideal. Also, keep in mind that Claydol loses a lot of momentum, so it shouldn't be used on offensive teams. It is best used on teams that require an Electric-type check and an entry hazard remover, but cannot afford to use Defog because they are using Spikes or Toxic Spikes.

Team Options
========

Any Pokemon that appreciates hazards removed appreciates the support Claydol provides. It is good on teams that do not like Sticky Web, as Claydol can clear it out while being immune to it. Ironically, while offensive teams like Sticky Web removed, Claydol is a huge momentum killer for offensive teams. It is best used on balanced and stall teams that hate Spikes and Toxic Spikes, both of which Claydol is immune to. As Claydol has no form of reliable recovery outside of Rest, it appreciates Wish support from Pokemon such as Alomomola and Aromatisse. Alomomola and Aromatisse are also good partners because they have good physical Defense, allowing them to switch into physical attackers better than Claydol can. Drapion has remarkable synergy with Claydol, as it resists all of Claydol's weaknesses but Water, and Claydol covers its single weakness to Ground. It also carries Toxic Spikes which allows Claydol to run Psyshock. Roselia has both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, resists Grass- and Water-type attacks, and can remove Toxic Spikes on the switch, reducing the pressure placed on Claydol. Qwilfish carries Spikes or Toxic Spikes and resists Bug-type moves unlike Drapion and Roselia, but loses out on resisting Grass-type attacks; Claydol covers its Psychic- and Ground-type weaknesses. Registeel can run Stealth Rock if Claydol opts for Protect.

Other Options
########

Unfortunately for Claydol, it only has one, really small niche, so its other options are very limited. A weather support set could be used, as it has access to Rain Dance, Sunny Day, and Sandstorm, but there are other Pokemon that can use those moves better. Claydol can be used for Trick Room support, but Trick Room in itself is a tough strategy to work and there are better users such as Cresselia. A set using a Choice item and Trick seems like a good idea, but Claydol has very limited offensive presence, even with a Choice item, making it a liability if you ever find yourself in a tough spot. A dual screens set seems cool, but it is outclassed by other users such as Cresselia and even Uxie. Finally, Ice Beam can be used to hit Gligar hard, but offers little utility outside of that and is very weak.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Type Advantage**: Anything with a super effective STAB move can take down Claydol without much trouble.

**Dark-types**: Dark-types, especially physical attackers, can KO Claydol with their super effective STAB moves. Drapion and Shiftry are great examples.

**Ghost-types**: All Ghost-types except for Doublade take minimal damage from anything Claydol has and deal heavy damage with their STAB moves. Mega Banette is an excellent example, as it can block status moves with Taunt, blocks Rapid Spin, and has high Attack.

**Substitute Users**: Substitute users, especially Flying-types, have little trouble setting up on Claydol. SubRoost Moltres and Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary in particular are good examples of Pokemon who do this effectively.
