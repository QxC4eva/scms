<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Assist is undoubtedly a gimmicky move, and in order to have any chance of working your entire team must be built entirely around it. The most obvious way to abuse Assist is using it to select the pseudo-Hazing moves Roar and Whirlwind without their negative priority. In conjunction with entry hazards, fast Choice Scarf Assist users and especially Liepard with Prankster can shuffle the opposing team to death without being hit, provided they select the correct moves. The remainder of your team should carry Spikes, Stealth Rock, Roar, Whirlwind and the above moves, which cannot be selected by Assist. This is, of course, extremely unreliable, and as such, though fun, it is not recommended.</p>
