<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Movepools are largely considered the single most important competitive aspect of a Pok&eacute;mon. The reasoning for this is that a movepool defines a Pok&eacute;mon's diversity, what they can and cannot beat, and what functionality they can provide for their team. Some movepools, such as those of Tyranitar and Genesect, are enormous and provide nearly limitless options, while others, like that of Talonflame, are just big enough to make the Pok&eacute;mon worth using. Both of these types of movepools have their respective places with different CAPs, but there's a lot to movepools that might not be apparent at first glance. This article's focus is to make sure that you have all the information and all the resources you need in order to understand how to go about building a movepool and how movepools interlink with the CAP process.</p>

<h2><a name="restrict">Movepool Restrictions</a></h2>

<p>In the past, many CAP movepools have tended to creep in power toward being bloated with as many legal moves as possible. In order to address these issues, as well as bring CAP Pok&eacute;mon movepools back in line with the movepools of common OU Pok&eacute;mon, some limitations and restrictions were placed upon the movepool stage of the CAP process. As described in <a href="/cap/process/events/movepool_submissions#size">this</a> process guide article, the size of a Pok&eacute;mon's movepool is limited by its Base Stat Rating (a measure of how good the stat spread is relative to all other Pok&eacute;mon), such that the greater the BSR, the lower total number of moves, and number of Restricted Moves, are allowed in the movepool. A Restricted Move is defined as "A move that is considered by the combination of its power, accuracy, effect chance, move priority, power points, and overall type coverage to be of distinct individual competitive advantage in any given movepool", and a list of them can be found <a href="/cap/process/events/movepool_submissions#restricted">here</a>. Note, however, that there are lots of rules governing what is and isn't a Restricted Move based on different situations - for example, a Pok&eacute;mon with Zap Cannon would have it classed as a RM if it had No Guard as well, but not if it had a different ability. The article provided goes into more detail about these restrictions and exemptions. A complete list of Restricted Moves can also be found in that article, but you can also refer to <a href="/cap/articles/restricted_moves">this</a> article for a list of these moves split up into categories, thus making them a lot easier to deal with. Once these restrictions are set, you as a movepool creator must adhere to them strictly.</p>

<h2><a name="require">Movepool Requirements</a></h2>

<p>While the raw limit placed on the number of Restricted Moves and total number of moves that may be in your CAP Pok&eacute;mon's movepool is generally the only specific requirement placed, there exist some other requirements that need to be adhered to. Certain moves that all Pok&eacute;mon get, such as Toxic, Round, and Protect, are required on all movepools, unless the Movepool Leader specifies otherwise. All of these are Technical Machines, and are highlighted on the list of TM moves below. In addition, the Restricted Moves that are and are not allowed on your movepools will be specified during the <a href="/cap/process/events/move_discussion">Move Discussion</a> stages, such that all moves that are too strong or otherwise undesirable for that particular CAP will be made illegal. You should be aware that the default position on any particular move is that they are illegal - if they are not specifically listed in the Move Discussion as allowed, then they are disallowed. If there's a particular move you want to add to your movepool for flavour reasons, but which is not brought up for discussion during this time, then make sure that you bring it up yourself so that the Movepool Leader can declare it allowed. You should also take note that Legendary Signature moves (a list of which can be found <a href="/cap/process/events/movepool_submissions#exemption">here</a>) are automatically disallowed for all CAPs.</p>

<h2><a name="tm">Technical Machine Moves</a></h2>

<p>There are 100 TM moves available to all Pok&eacute;mon, plus 5 HM moves. Existing fully-evolved Gen VI Pok&eacute;mon have anywhere between 22 and 59 TM moves in their movepool, with an overall average of 37 moves. It should be noted that, with some exceptions, Fire- and Grass-type Pok&eacute;mon tend not to learn any Ice-type moves, while Ice- and Grass-type Pok&eacute;mon tend not to learn any Fire-type moves.</p>

<p>Be aware, again, that the moves in bold in the table below <strong>must be present</strong> on all movepools if they are to be considered legal; the reason for this is that all fully-evolved Pok&eacute;mon (with certain exceptions, such as Wobbuffet and Regigigas) obtain them. The sole exception to this is where the CAP is genderless (and hence has no egg moves), in which case you may forgo Attract. It is also the case that Sunny Day tends to be present on all Pok&eacute;mon bar those of the Water or Ice typing, while Rain Dance tends to be present on all Pok&eacute;mon bar those of the Fire typing. These are not required on CAP movepools, however.</p>

</dl>

<h2><a name ="levelup">Level-Up Moves</a></h2>

<p>A level-up move list can contain anywhere from 13 to 25 moves, although the average number of moves is around 18. Up to eight of these moves will be Heart Scale moves, meaning that they can only be relearned using a Heart Scale, aren't known at level 1, and aren't learned at any higher level. A Pok&eacute;mon may only have a Heart Scale move if it has at least 4 level 1 moves already; consequently, you may have a maximum of twelve effective level 1 moves. This, however, would be an extreme case, as with Florges. As a Pok&eacute;mon levels up, the moves tend to get more powerful. This means that a move such as Crunch or Earthquake would usually be learned later than Bite or Mud-Slap. Furthermore, if the Pok&eacute;mon has a pre-evolution, as with Florges or Noivern, one of the following two things will generally happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to three level 1 moves may be repeated in further levels. These moves are learned by the Pok&eacute;mon's pre-evolution as well. For example, Noivern learns Hurricane, Dragon Pulse, and Boomburst at Level 1, and learns them again at Level 62, 70, and 75, respectively.</li>
<li>The Pok&eacute;mon has a few level 1 moves, and then an extremely short or non-existent movepool. For example, Florges learns four level 1 moves and eight Heart Scale moves, but has no other level-up moves. This is typically only the case for Pok&eacute;mon that evolve via stone items. In this case, you may be advised to include a pre-evolution movepool to describe the remainder of its movepool.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name ="egg">Egg Moves</a></h2>

<p>Egg moves are those moves learned through breeding. In order to have egg moves, you must specify which egg groups the CAP belongs to. The movepool designer will have to decide on egg groups that grant access to the moves that are listed, and it is preferred that they make flavour sense on the Pok&eacute;mon, but is not entirely necessary. If you are struggling, note that Smeargle can pass down any egg moves you desire, and so putting the CAP in the Field egg group is an entirely legitimate recourse. A Pok&eacute;mon may have as few as 4 egg moves and at most 13 egg moves, but the average is typically around five. Pok&eacute;mon that are genderless or do not breed cannot have any egg moves. It is not necessary to specify egg move illegalities, but you may do so if you choose; note that due to new breeding mechanics, illegal egg move combinations will no longer occur barring circumstances with prior generation moves or event moves, the former of which is not an issue as all CAPs for XY are assumed to have come into being in Generation VI, and the latter is typically unnecessary unless you deliberately want an illegality to be present.</p>

<h2><a name ="tutor">Move Tutor Moves</a></h2>

<p>Move Tutors are people in the Pok&eacute;mon world that teach Pok&eacute;mon moves for a price. In Pok&eacute;mon X and Y, there are only a few Move Tutors, and most of these are limited to starter Pok&eacute;mon. Because of this, they have little competitive value and high flavour price, but are worth mentioning to make you aware that they exist. Note that Draco Meteor is found on most Dragon-types.</p>

<h2><a name ="event">Event Moves</a></h2>

<p>A fifth location for moves to be placed in is that of "event moves", which would in theory be analogous to an existing Pok&eacute;mon being distributed via a Nintendo promotion, which includes a move it would not ordinarily learn. This has never been done before, and indeed is frowned upon as a choice for various historical reasons, but is currently the only real option if you want the CAP to somehow have incompatibilities between its moves, as any event moves would be illegal alongside egg moves. Another option would be to specify a shiny or fixed-nature distribution, such that there is some other competitive cost to the use of that move. This would, in theory, be one way to include a powerful move while keeping the CAP balanced by imposing a cost.</p>

<h2><a name ="flavour">Flavour Notes</a></h2>

<p>What is this "flavour" that people keep harping on about? When the word "flavour" is used in the context of CAP, it typically refers to the little, non-competitive extras that are added to all Pok&eacute;mon in existence in order to give them substance and, in many cases, a personality. This can range from abilities, such as Necturna's Forewarn, to various moves, such as Cyclohm's Double Hit and Tri Attack (its second and third evolutionary stages have two and three heads, respectively). In this case, flavour doesn't mean that the move itself is non-competitive, but that the move is added because it fits with the CAP's artistic theme; a steam train Pok&eacute;mon would be expected to be able to use Scald, for example. It's hard to engineer good flavour into a movepool, and aside from the cases already mentioned it isn't enforced, but it's a good idea to get to know some of the precedents set, as while originality is always good, seeing which moves commonly occur on similar Pok&eacute;mon can allow you to build a sturdy foundation, on top of which the rest of the movepool can sit.</p>

<p>It should be made absolutely clear, however, that while flavour is all well and good, it should never take precedence over competitive concerns, and indeed should not be discussed or even faintly alluded to in any of the competitive discussion threads. There are places in the forum where this kind of discussion is allowed, but make certain to read the rules of the threads in question before jumping in.</p>

<h3><a name ="type">Type-Move Guidelines</a></h3>

<p>These moves appear on more than 5% of fully-evolved Pok&eacute;mon (i.e. 20 or more fully-evolved Pok&eacute;mon) and are found on over 90% of the Pok&eacute;mon of a given type. Hence, if you see a Pok&eacute;mon of that type, you would expect to find the moves listed after it.</p>

<p>Talonflame has 50 total moves (seven moves are found twice) in its movepool, 24 of which are Restricted Moves, such that it conforms fairly to the general rule of having half of the moves in a movepool be RMs. It can clearly be seen from the above lists that the reason Talonflame is highly competitive, at least in terms of its movepool, is its level-up pool, which features everything it really needs to be successful, with only a few competitive TMs, such as Swords Dance and U-turn, not being found on the level-up list. Note that Talonflame's BSR is around 250, and hence it sits roughly between "Above Average" and "Good" in terms of its BSR; hence, if Talonflame were a CAP, it would be allowed a far more expansive movepool. The reason that Talonflame is competitively viable in its current state is its Gale Wings ability, and the movepool is nothing particularly exceptional, barring high-powered STAB moves. This, then, is a good example of a successful Pok&eacute;mon with a limited movepool.</p>
