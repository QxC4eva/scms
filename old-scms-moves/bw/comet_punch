[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. It has a 1/3 chance for the move to hit either 2 or 3 times, and a 1/6 chance to hit either 4 or 5 times. If a Focus Sash or the ability Sturdy is activated through one of the hits, another hit will KO the target. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate for every hit taken, and every hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock, Razor Fang, or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. Color Change will only activate on the last hit of the move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat all the hits as a single attack. If this move breaks a Substitute, the attack can still continue and hurt the target. If the target holds a Chilan or Jaboca Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. If the user has the ability Skill Link, this move will always hit five times.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>One of the numerous multi-hit moves. However, there isn't much competitive value for it at all, considering it has a very low average Base Power, less than desirable accuracy, and shallow distribution. More to the point, only five fully evolved Pokemon can use it: Hitmonchan, Kangaskhan, Ledian, Smeargle, and Conkeldurr. All of them have much better options for a moveslot, so don't use this move.</p>
