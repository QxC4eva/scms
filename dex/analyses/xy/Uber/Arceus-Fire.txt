Overview
########
- The added Fairy resist finally gives Fire Arceus a much desired niche as a check to threats like Geomancy Xerneas.
- Alongside this small defensive niche, it can run a CM set with an nice offensive STAB.
- Short of checking Fairy-types, the defensive typing is useless and vulnerable to multiple common types like Water, Ground, and Rock.
- Even offensively, Fire Arceus's STAB requires more coverage than it has moveslots leaving it easily checked by quite a few Pokemon.
- Opting for Fire Arceus prevents you from using another, more generally useful Arceus forme.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Judgment / Flamethrower
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Recover
move 4: Thunderbolt / Spacial Rend
item: Flame Plate
nature: Timid
evs: 248 HP / 8 SpD / 252 Spe

Moves
========

- Judgment is a reliable STAB move with a solid damage output.
- Flamethrower is weaker than Judgment but it comes with a small chance to burn.
- Fire Blast is a fair bit stronger than Judgemnt and has a small burn chance but the accuracy isn't perfect and it has only 8 PP.
- Calm Mind gives Fire Arceus a boost in Special Defense to beat out Geomancy Xerneas as well as a boost in Special Attack to have a more significant offensive presence.
- Recover is also neccessary to gather more boosts, particularly when fighting against a Geomancy Xerneas.
- Thunderbolt has fairly nice coverage with Arceus's Fire-type STAB as it hits Kyogre and Ho-Oh for super effective damage and Palkia for neutral damage.
- Spacial Rend hits Dragon-types for super effective damage and has nice neutral coverage with Judgment but it misses out on hitting Kyogre which is an important target due to the bothersome rain it brings.
- Thunder is much stronger than Thunderbolt and has a high chance to paralyze but the accuracy is poor outside of rain which isn't favorable weather to Fire Arceus's STAB.

Set Details
========

- Max HP is needed to reliably check Geomancy Xerneas and max Speed is needed to speed tie with other Arceus formes and outspeed as much as possible since Fire Arceus has a mediocre defensive typing and prefers to not get hit.

Usage Tips
========

- If Stealth Rock is up and you want to check Geomancy Xerneas, take advantage of the fact that the coverage options that hit Fire Arceus for neutral damage only have 70% accuracy to spam Recover until it either misses or Xerneas tries to boost again. You can then starting gathering Calm Mind boosts that make handling Xerneas a lot easier. 
- If Stealth Rock isn't up you can simply use Calm Mind to beat Geomancy Xerneas.
- Surprise is a very nice element when using niche Arceus formes like Fire Arceus. Odds are, from Team Preview your opponent will assume your Arceus is an Extreme Killer Normal Arceus if you lack an Xerneas check elsewhere on your team.
- Try to eliminate any opposing Kyogre as fast as possible as they'll be a huge thorn in your side when trying to go on the offensive with Fire Arceus.
- Fire Arceus doesn't like Toxic and Paralysis as it can't do much of what it is expected to do once crippled with these statuses so avoid them at all costs.

Team Options
========

- Groudon brings sun which powers up Arceus's STAB and gets rid of rain. Although, these benefits are much less important as weather only lasts 5 turns.
- Defog support from Mega Scizor or Giratina-O is appreciated as Fire Arceus is weak to Stealth Rock. It isn't needed to fulfill its role as a Geomancy Xerneas check.
- Palkia is very appealing as a Kyogre check which Fire Arceus is quite vulnerable to.
- Landorus-T helps with Ground-types like Ground Arceus.

Other Options
########

- A Swords Dance set with Overheat and Extreme Speed can take advantage of Fire Arceus's strong STAB move to roast physical walls but it's a gimmick set at best.
- Roar is an option on the Calm Mind set to beat Geomancy Xerneas that use Psyshock but that coverage option is a mediocre choice for Xerneas and it requires Xerneas to boost more in order to do over 50% to Fire Arceus in the first place.

Checks & Counters
########

- **Kyogre**: Summons rain and has very large special bulk. It can also don a Choice Scarf and OHKO with Surf.
- **Palkia**: Doubly resistent to Fire and neutral to Electric while it can hit back with a STAB Hydro Pump. It has to watch out for Spacial Rend, though.
- **Heatran**: Immune to Fire-type moves, resistent to Dragon-type attacks, and has enough bulk to easily tank Thunderbolts and hit back with Toxic.
- **Tyranitar**: Large special bulk, Fire-type resist, and STAB, super effective Stone Edge easily stops Fire Arceus in its tracks.
- **Blissey**: Can tank any special attack and cripple with Toxic.
- **Giratina**: Both Giratina and Giratina-O resist Arceus's STAB and has plenty bulk to deal with coverage moves, although Spacial Rend is bothersome.
- **Lugia**: Very large special bulk with Multiscale and Toxic means Fire Arceus will struggle to break past Lugia.
- **Rock Arceus**: Resists Fire-type attacks and doesn't mind Fire Arceus's coverage options while Rock-type Judgment is super effective.
- **Water Arceus**: Annoyed by Thunderbolt but otherwise fears little from Fire Arceus and its Judgment hits back hard for super effective damage.
- **Ground Arceus**: Has enough natural bulk to tank a boosted attack and hit right back with a powerful Earthquake.
- **Ho-Oh**: With its titanic special bulk, even Thunderbolt Fire Arceus will lose to Earthquake Ho-Oh while those with Spacial Rend have no chance.
- **Stealth Rock**: Fire Arceus takes 25% from Stealth Rock making it a great way to indirectly limit what the Arceus forme can do.
- **Zekrom**: Resists both Fire-type STAB and Thunderbolt while it hits back hard with Bolt Strike. Fears Spacial Rend, though.
- **Charizard**: With the exception of Spacial Rend, Fire Arceus can't do anything to stop Mega Charizard-X from gathering Dragon Dances.
- **Reshiram**: Toxic Reshiram can abuse it's typing to cripple Fire Arceus and stall it out with Roost.
- **Status**: Random Toxic and Thunder Wave will stop Fire Arceus from being able to amass boosts and pull off any sort of sweep.
