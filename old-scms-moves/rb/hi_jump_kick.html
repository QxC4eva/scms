[SHORT DESC]
User takes 1 HP recoil if attack misses.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If it misses, the user loses 1 HP. If the user knocks itself out, then the opponent's Pokémon will not attack during the same turn. The effects of poison, burn, and Leech Seed will be ignored on that turn. The Pokémon will not lose 1 PP for the attack it was about to use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Hi Jump Kick is absurdly powerful and highly accurate. However, its only user, Hitmonlee, is a pretty subpar Pokemon only seen in the depths of UU, since it's outclassed by Machamp. The recoil is very low, so you can use this move without danger and you should use it whenever you use Hitmonlee.</p>
