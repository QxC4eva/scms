<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Has a 10% chance to burn the target. Has a critical hit rate one stage higher than normal. Assuming there are no other critical hit modifiers in play, this move has a 1/8 chance to get a critical hit instead of a 1/16 chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Blaze Kick is not exactly a bad move competitively, and yet is quite rarely seen. This is largely due to its poor distribution and imperfect accuracy. All of the fully evolved Pokemon that learn this move, Infernape, Blaziken, Lucario and Hitmonlee, can use it to reasonable effect, but mostly have better things to do. Blaziken and Infernape usually prefer to use the more powerful Flare Blitz, or attack on the special side with Fire Blast, and Lucario and Hitmonlee can find better coverage options, as they lack STAB on the move.</p>
