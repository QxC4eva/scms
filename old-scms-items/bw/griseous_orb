[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>May only be held by Giratina. When held by Giratina, transforms Giratina into Giratina-O. Raises the power of Giratina-O's Dragon- and Ghost-type moves by 4915/4096 (approximately 1.2). Griseous Orb cannot be removed through the use of Trick, Switcheroo, Thief, Covet, or Knock Off.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that it is Giratina-O's sole held item and thus limits its versatility, Giratina-O will often be using its STABs in battle and appreciates the boost granted by this item. The boost allows Giratina-O to 2HKO 4/0 Mewtwo with Shadow Sneak, and also ensures that Giratina-O's Draco Meteor and Dragon Tail will leave a mark on its victims. Furthermore, the immunity to theft granted by the Griseous Orb can potentially allow Giratina-O to switch into Trick, which might be seen on Choice Scarf Mewtwo and Darkrai, and render them helpless until they switch out.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Marvelous Bridge (given by the Shadow Triad).</p>
