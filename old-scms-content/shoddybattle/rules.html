Rules
[page]

<p>When you join the Smogon Pokemon Online Server, you are to obey the following rules in order to keep the chat nice and clean. Please be sure to read them thoroughly and check up on them once in a while because they are subject to change. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse. Violation of any rules may result in warnings, kicks, and / or bans.</p>

<h2>General Rules</h2>

<ul class="long_list"> 

<li><strong>Use common sense.</strong> You will end up following most of these rules automatically if you use common sense. Please try to think before you act. Don't act dumb; the definition of "dumb" is up to moderator discretion.</li>

<li>Your Pokemon Online name may not be used for profanity, racist comments, or insulting other users. If you break this rule, you will be asked to change your name by a moderator. Refusing to do so or logging on with the same name later will result in you being temporarily banned from the server. Likewise, nicknames aimed at insulting the moderation staff will be banned on sight.</li>

<li><strong>Smogon enforces COPPA.</strong> If you admit to being under the age of thirteen, you will be banned until you become thirteen years old.</li>

<li>Do not ask moderators to disclose the alternate nicknames of other users. It is none of your business.</li>

<li>Respect the decisions of the moderating staff. Do not talk back after being warned, kicked or banned. Do not question the actions of the staff. If a staff member tells you to do something or not do something, do not do the opposite. Do not disrespect the staff themselves.</li>

<li>The RankingBot sometimes messes up and displays irrational rankings. This is a known problem; please refrain from repeatedly bringing it up. If you wish to view your ranking, you can instead right click on your own name and select "View Ranking."</li>

<li>Do not abuse the Channel system. Creating channels with obnoxious or rude names or creating an excessive amount of useless channels falls under this rule.</li></ul>

<h2>Chat Rules</h2>

<ul class="long_list">

<li>Do not ask for a battle in the main chat. We have ladders with find tabs for the appropriate matches; use those instead, or manually challenge people. It might be polite to PM people before you manually challenge them, to agree on which metagame and rules to use.</li>

<li>Do not flood, spam or clog up the chat. This involves repeating the same thing over and over, stretching the screen horizontally, repeatedly joining / parting, etc. This includes pasting long bits of text, including logs from your battles. Yes, it may be amusing that someone quit after you beat their Salamence with Delibird, but keep it to yourself.</li>

<li>Do not link to pornographic websites. You will be banned.</li>

<li>Smogon is an English website, so only speak English in the main chat. Keep other languages to PM. In other words, falam apenas em Inglês and hable en Inglés solamente.</li>

<li>No excessive use of CAPITAL LETTERS. It makes you look childish and the only attention you are going to get is negative attention. Additionally, overuse of characters like '!!!!!!!!!!' or '??????????' is not considered funny, so please do not do it.</li>

<li>Do not junior mod. This means that you should not tell staff how to do their job. Do not post messages in the chat like "in b4 kick" or "ban that guy".</li>

<li><strong>No advertising.</strong> Linking to well-known sites like YouTube and MySpace is okay, but sorry, we don't care about your obscure upstart "community".</li>

<li>Respect each other. Having a discussion is one thing, but do not flame, troll or bait other users merely because they disagree with you, got a critical hit on you, etc. Also, racist comments will not be tolerated on the server, as even when used in a joking manner, they are incredibly offensive.</li>

<li>If someone rejects your challenge, that is usually the sign he / she does not want to battle. Do not repeatedly challenge someone manually.</li>

<li>Do not go off-topic and disrupt the current conversation. For example, if the chat is currently about Fire Emblem, then don't randomly interrupt with "Which is better 252/4/252 or 252/252/4?".</li>

<li>Do not reverse the chat. Violators of this rule will be banned.</li>

<li>The user Woodchuck may not use any puns.</li></ul>

<h2>Battle Rules</h2>

<ul class="long_list">

<li>For all generations, the standard assumed rules for all tiers to be turned on are Freeze Clause, Sleep Clause, and Species Clause. For fifth generation, Wifi Battle is also turned on. Those are also the rules you will find when battling on the ladder. Information on tiers can be found here.</li>

<li>If you are in a Rated match and your opponent has not moved for over five minutes, yet the battle has not ended by timeout, notify a moderator and ask him/her to kick your opponent. Do note that moderators cannot see how much time has elapsed, so you may have to wait for a period of time just so the moderator can ensure that your battle has actually timed out. Timer stalling in general is disallowed. Wasting time and then making actions at the last second just to stall the timer will result in a kick.</li>

<li>Do not use movesets that are impossible to obtain legally ingame, such as Baton Pass Speed Boost Blaziken. If your opponent demonstrates that a moveset you are using is illegal, you must forfeit if he or she requests that you do so. If a moderator needs to be involved, you will be kicked or banned.</li></ul>

<h2>Tournament Rules</h2>

<ul class="long_list">

<li>Tournaments can only be started by people with a rank of megauser and up. Megausers are picked at moderator discretion, and asking is likely to reduce your chances of being chosen.</li>

<li>In all tournament matches, the standard assumed rules for all tiers to be turned on are Freeze Clause, Sleep Clause, and Species Clause. For fifth generation, Wifi Battle is also turned on. </li>

<li>Do not disallow spectators from a finals match. Those who violate this rule risk their battle being restarted; repeat offenders might just be outright disqualified.</li>

<li>Any player found cheating on the ladder will be banned for a minimum of 7 days.</li></ul>

<p>If you follow these simple rules, you really have nothing to worry about. Have fun on Smogon University!</p>

<p>If you are banned and you believe the moderator acted unfairly, you are welcome to post a complaint in the designated sub-forum in the Community section of the site. We are primarily interested in providing our users with the best possible experience, so we want to know if you have been treated unfairly.</p>
