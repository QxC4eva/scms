[SHORT DESC]
Transforms into the foe.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Transforms into the target, copying its stats (except HP), moves (at 5 PP each), type, weight, and ability. The stats are copied exactly, without regards to EVs, IVs, and level. IVs of the target are copied for purposes of Hidden Power, as well. Transform copies the target's species, which means that DeapSeaScale, DeepSeaTooth, Light Ball, Metal Powder, Soul Dew, and Thick Club activate only if the target is the correct species. Choice Band keeps its boost upon Transforming. Level is not copied, so a low level Pokemon does less damage than a high level Pokemon when using the same move (because the attacker's level is part of the damage formula).</p>
