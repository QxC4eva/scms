<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 20% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>At first glance, Dragon Rush is a viable alternative over Dragon Claw; however, it suffers from bad distribution and terrible accuracy. While Hone Claws can be used to patch up the latter drawback, using Dragon Dance or Swords Dance with Dragon Claw are almost always better options, the former raising Attack and Speed simultaneously, while the latter instantly doubles the user's Attack (a +2 Dragon Claw is stronger than a +1 Dragon Rush).</p>
