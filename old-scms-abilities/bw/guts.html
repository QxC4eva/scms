Attack is increased by 50% when afflicted with status.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is affected by burn, freeze, paralysis, poison, or sleep, its Attack is increased by 50%. Furthermore, the Attack drop of burn is nullified. Unlike <a href="/bw/abilities/quick_feet">Quick Feet</a>, Guts does not nullify the Speed-lowering effect of paralysis.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There isn't a single Pokemon out there that doesn't welcome Guts into its arsenal. The boost in power and immunity to burn's Attack reducing side effect make Guts a boon for physical attackers and one of the best abilities in the game. Feel free to slap it on whatever you can for a greater array of switch in opportunities on enemy <a href="/bw/moves/toxic">Toxic</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/will-o-wisp">Will-O-Wisp</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/thunder_wave">Thunder Wave</a> attempts. For a more aggressive approach, you can even give your Guts Pokemon a status Orb and have it firing off superbly destructive attacks every game.</p>
