<p>A thread should be created by the moderators for each event in the process. Thread names are listed above. Each thread name should be prefixed with "CAP X -", with "X" being a numeric designation of the sequence of the overall project.</p>

<p>Topic Leadership should adhere to this event sequence as much as possible, however sometimes steps need to be accelerated or delayed to accommodate the specific needs of a given concept or project.</p>  

<p>There has been MUCH debate in the past over the optimal sequence of events in a CAP project. There are many advantages and disadvantages to performing any given step before or after another step. There is no "perfect solution". Over the history of the CAP project, we have found the sequence above to be the most suitable for satisfying the overall project goals.</p>
