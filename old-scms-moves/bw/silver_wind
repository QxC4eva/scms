<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to boost the user's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Silver Wind is an incredibly gimmicky move. Due to its low Base Power, it does not serve very well as a main STAB move or a coverage move, especially when there are many more powerful options. Silver Wind's only use is in its secondary effect, but the fact that the chance to raise the user's stats is very low, aided by the fact that Silver Wind itself will not do much damage, means that Silver Wind should never be used, even on Serene Grace Togekiss.</p>
