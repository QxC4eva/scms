<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of +1.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for Vacuum Wave, it's one of the least used priority moves because it's a special based Fighting-type attack instead of a physical based attack. This means that the majority of Pokemon that get STAB on the move normally have a much higher base Attack stat than a Special Attack stat, and would thusly prefer Mach Punch to Vacuum Wave. However, there are a couple of users of the move in OU that make good use it, namely Toxicroak and Lucario. However the special attacking variants of these Pokemon are still rarely seen, with both also having access to Swords Dance, and the latter also having Mach Punch. Swords Dance more complements their other attacks than Nasty Plot and Vacuum Wave do, relegating Vacuum Wave to relative obscurity.</p>
