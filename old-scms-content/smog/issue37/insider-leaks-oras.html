<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Pok&eacute;mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, these games are going to bring back so many memories. I remember back in 2003, playing through Ruby version for the first time. It seems like yesterday, when, in reality, it's been 11 years. Back then, we chose which game we wanted to play based on which legendary looked cooler, not like these days where Smogon University ingrains into our heads that Kyogre is a dominating force in the Ubers metagame, and we are forced to soft reset the games for weeks to get a flawless 5IV one with a good nature. In any case, Ruby and Sapphire set a few precedents for the Pok&eacute;mon franchise as a whole, and they have left a lasting impression on me, so I've dedicated most of my time to learning about these games.</p>

<p>There's one problem: I'm in high school. No, it's not like I care about my grades or my image, the problem is everyone thinks they're too "cool" for Pok&eacute;mon. It's all about the drooped jeans and sunglasses these days, and then they make fun of me for looking like a nerd. I'd rather be playing Pok&eacute;mon 24/7 than doing drugs to look cool, thank you very much. The internet is useless, with everyone talking about fake leaks constantly, so I can't find a reliable, sound source about these games. Of course, that was until I found my little sister's boyfriend.</p>

<p>My little sister is in 6th grade, and her boyfriend Rick was visiting (Geez, maybe I need to learn something here. People seem to be finding matches already and I'm sitting here alone.). They were talking in their room, and I was simply focused on completing a 100% run of Pok&eacute;mon Emerald before ORAS came out. I completely tuned out their mindless middle school drama chatter, until I overheard something interesting.</p>

<p>It was a remixed theme of Littleroot Town, seeming like it was coming from a 3DS. Normally I wouldn't be caring or listening into them, but the music was so loud and distinguishable that my curiosity peaked, and I listened to their following conversation.</p>

<p>Rick said, "Babe, wanna hear these new facts I got about the new games Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire?"</p>

<p>I was thrown off by the terminology of "babe", but in any case, my sister replied with, "Oooh, that seems cool! But how do you know they are real?"</p>

<p>Rick said, "My friend in Japan got me the game early, I've already beaten it."</p>

<p>This was insane, the kid already had access to the game, and he's probably already accessed about every single secret hidden within it. A million things were running through my head, but the first thing I did was run and grab a notebook and pencil, and I started furiously scribbling down everything he said to my sister.</p>

<h2>The Facts</h2>

<ul>

	<li><p>There is a new secret factor in contests called "Fabulous". To unlock this, your Pok&eacute;mon must be a male with max stats in "Cute" and "Beauty". In addition, there is a new Pikachu Cosplay costume that corresponds to this "Fabulous" trait. The Pikachu wears what seems to be a tank top with tight jeans, and it remains male.</p></li>

	<li><p>As confirmed, there is a new mechanics for horde battles where 5 trainers can challenge you at once. If you have 5 open slots on your team and you use the button combo L+R+A+B, you will gain 5 master balls and the trainers Pok&eacute;mon will turn into catchable legendaries. If you input the code incorrectly, there will be 5 shiny Magikarp instead.</p></li>

	<li><p>Mirage Island is now surrounded by mirrors, and if you interact with the big mirror at the center of the island, a copy of yourself will emerge as a Pok&eacute;mon and will challenge you to a battle. It is the same level as your age and will know moves based on your personality (so in my case: Slack Off).</p></li>

	<li><p>Contest stats are also implemented into battles now. A Pok&eacute;mon with a higher strength stat has a higher damage output, while a Pok&eacute;mon with a higher Beauty stat makes the opponent fall to hax much more often. And just like in reality, Coolness does absolutely nothing.</p></li>

	<li><p>As we recently learned, you can fly in the overworld of Hoenn and find all non-event legendaries from the previous games. However, if you Fly high enough, you will align yourself at the top of Mount Coronet and encounter a black-colored Arceus, which appears to be its Primal form, similar to Kyogre and Groudon. He will battle you at level 100 with the move Judgment and a new move called Doom Day, which will wipe your save file if he gets that move off.</p></li>

	<li><p>There is a new item called the "Mega Mega Bracelet", which only Steven has. This item allows you to have multiple Mega Pok&eacute;mon on one team, so when you battle Steven, he will have a team of 6 Mega evolved fossil Pok&eacute;mon. You can acquire this item after beating him with the shiny Mega Metagross.</p></li>

	<li><p>The sickness that Wally is plagued by is confirmed to be Ebola. The objective of the main character is to try to bring him back home to be treated and halt the spread of the disease. Ebola is also a new status condition which makes the Pok&eacute;mon lose HP each turn and can only be cured by Full Restores while holding Lum Berries.</p></li>

	<li><p>A Mega Slowking has been confirmed to counter Mega Slowbro; however, it seems to have no difference visually other than the shell being reversed, covering its head down to its legs.</p></li>

	<li><p>It has been confirmed that Mega Rayquaza will Mega Evolve in a manner different from all other Megas. This method is where you just obtain a "Chaos Emerald" as a key item, so Rayquaza can reach maximum Speed.</p></li>

	<li><p>If you play the demo at least once every day until the game comes out, you can transfer all 3 of the mega starters to your ORAS save file. However, their "ultimate moves" (Frenzy Plant, Blast Burn, and Hydro Cannon) can not be deleted. This is because they are the best moves in existence.</p></li>

	<li><p>Space is a brand new area unique to Alpha Ruby and Omega Sapphire. Similar to visiting the Sevii Islands in FRLG, one can go to Space by visiting the space shuttle postgame and speaking with the head scientist. Space offers a number of unique and never before seen features, such as secret planets bases and the all-new cosmic battle mode. Comet Rain is a new Rock-type field hazard that stacks with Stealth Rock.</p></li>

	<li><p>Similar to the Sevii Islands, there is also a sort of mini-plot in Space. When traveling between planets, you happen upon a deserted, barren world. Eventually, you find a sick Jirachi, and after doing a bunch of stupid quest things you discover that the virus is DEOXYS! You then fight Deoxys, but he is only catchable in Omega Sapphire. Attempts to catch him in Alpha Ruby cause the Pok&eacute;ball to be deflected. However, defeating him in Alpha Ruby causes the formerly sick Jirachi, which now has Gunk Shot as a new move, to join your party.</p></li>

	<li><p>It has also been confirmed that Kyogre, Groudon, and Rayquaza will each have a new signature move that allows them to take you to Space from the overworld at any time. Speculation currently leans towards Kyogre's attack being called Babeling Brook Blast, Groudon's being the already-confirmed Pinnacle Arrow, and Rayquaza will just Fly you there.</p></li>

	<li><p>The PSS and Super Training make a return in ORAS, sadly so does Pok&eacute;mon Amie. Pok&eacute;mon Amie comes with many new features, such as grooming your Pok&eacute;mon, dressing them up, and supporting them through their TV career that slowly but surely drains their integrity.</p></li>

	<li><p>As we know, Secret Bases have been completely revamped into Super Secret Bases. These bases can be customized to your liking by the items you have. However, there are very few items found in-game, and most are obtained through paid DLC from the E-Shop, for around $50.</p></li>

	<li><p>Capture The Flag is another part of the Super Secret Bases, originating from the Underground in DPP. The amount of flags you get can change the type of Secret Bases available to you. Some examples are the ability to set up Secret Bases in the sky, underwater, and inside Mew's Truck.</p></li>

	<li><p>When making gyms in Super Secret Bases, they can specialize in any type but Dark, and they must contain some of the most non-competitive sets on their Pok&eacute;mon possible. You may have up to three additional trainers in the gym, but they cannot have more than four Pok&eacute;mon and at least one needs to be a Rattata.</p></li>

	<li><p>Mega Hydreigon has been confirmed. It reverts to it's original planned tank design, and gains the ability Mega Launcher. It gains Steel as a third type, and the power of Steamroller is boosted to 150 BP.</p></li>

	<li><p>Lisia is a Contest Idol in Hoenn, and she assists you in many ways, like providing you with clothes. If you show her a shiny Mega Altaria with a max Beauty stat, she will provide you with a tuxedo and sunglasses, which can be worn in contests and throughout your adventure. Beating the Champion while wearing the tuxedo will make your Hall of Fame entry just various photos of you.</p></li>

	<li><p>Another major character in the game is Aarune, who teaches you all about the Super Secret Bases. If you use the move Secret Power against him in your first battle, he will recognize your capabilities and offer you a special Secret Base deep within Meteor Falls. Giovanni and Ghetsis are both hiding inside this base, and if you beat both in a double battle, they will declare you the new leader of Team PlasmaRocket.</p></li>

	<li><p>The BuzzNav in the PokeNav Plus lets you see the news about what's happening all around Hoenn. It also provides more cable television channels than Comcast and Dish combined.</p></li>

	<li><p>The DexNav can help find Pok&eacute;mon with special moves and abilities. It can also find Pok&eacute;mon of different types than what they usually have, like a Fire/Ghost Skitty.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This info seems to be 100% legitimate. I don't care what the hackers have found from the demo, and if you do, don't be surprised when you get a PM from me when ORAS comes out saying, "I told you so."</p>
