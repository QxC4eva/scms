<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Only Pokemon that are of the same type as the user are affected by this attack. If the user is dual-typed, this move will affect any Pokemon that shares either of its two types.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>No, I don't know what Game Freak was smoking either when they made this attack. Unless you're desperate for some form of Psychic-type spread damage, avoid this move completely and opt for Psychic or Psyshock instead.</p>
