<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Thunderbolt is the most powerful special Electric-type attack with 100% accuracy, which makes it a staple STAB move on many different Electric-type Pokemon, who typically have high Special. Most notably, it pairs well with Ice Beam to form the BoltBeam combination, a two-move combination that covers every Pokemon in the game for at least neutral damage. The fact that Thunderbolt has relatively high power for almost no negative side-effects whatsoever only serves to improve its case. Thunderbolt is a move of which to make good use. Zapdos is the main user of this move, obliterating opposing Lapras and Starmie.</p>
