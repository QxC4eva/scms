<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to poison the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Gunk Shot is not used much. Poison isn't prominent as an offensive type due to having poor super effective coverage; although powerful, this move also has only 70% accuracy. For these reasons Gunk Shot is exceedingly rare. Pokemon such as Arbok or Muk may sport it, as they need any extra power they can get. If in need of a Poison move to use, there are more reliable options across the board.</p>
