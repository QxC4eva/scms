<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Upon switch-in, Download raises either the Attack stat or Special Attack stat of the wielder by one stage depending on the foe's lowest current defensive stat; it will raise the Special Attack stat if the foe's current Special Defense is lower than its current Defense stat, and vice versa. If the foe's Defense and Special Defense are equal, then the Special Attack stat is increased. Download will add all opposing Pokemon's stats and calculate the lower stat between them in multi battles. Download will immediately activate whenever the ability is acquired, such as through <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Only four Pokemon have the ability Download, three of whom are in the Porygon evolution family. When <a href="/bw/pokemon/porygon-z">Porygon-Z</a> gets a Special Attack stat increase it will become a pretty threating sweeper, though <a href="/bw/abilities/adaptability">Adaptability</a> is also a tempting (less powerful, but more reliable) ability. Download is a good ability to use for <a href="/bw/moves/agility">Agility</a> sweeping because if the user gets a Special Attack stat increase, it will be a nice pair with a Speed stat increase from Agility making it not very easy to counter. The biggest user of Download, however, is undoubtedly <a href="/bw/pokemon/genesect">Genesect</a>, who can use a Special Attack boost to hit extremely hard and take full advantage of its huge special movepool, while an Attack boost enables it to fire off a <a href="/bw/moves/u-turn">U-turn</a> comparable in strength to <a href="/bw/pokemon/scizor">Scizor</a>'s. Download is a large part of Genesect's success, and the reason why some battlers choose to deliberately run low Defense IVs to ensure that Genesect can't get that all-important boost.</p>
