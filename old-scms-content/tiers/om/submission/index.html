Submission Process

<p>Users submitting Other Metagames is the whole foundation of the subforum and why we run; without user submitting metagames, we'd have no metagames running to keep us functioning! We thrive on users submitting and that's really where our heart is. However, some people may find it a bit intimidating submitting a metagame or may be out of ideas, this page will be about the process of submission. Submiting takes place in <a href="/forums/forums/om-submissions.289/">this</a> subform, <strong>strictly here alone</strong>. This is one of the most important rules of submission: only post in this subforum, <strong>never</strong> in the main subforum!</p>

Work in progress!
