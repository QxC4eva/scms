Overview
########

Taking flight from the ceiling of its cave once again, Crobat flies through the night in the Overused environment, ready to swoop its way down into a team requiring its support. When taking a look at Crobat, a few things will immediately stand out: its blazing fast base 130 Speed, immunity to Spikes and Ground-type moves, a strong base 120 STAB move in Brave Bird, solid recovery in Roost, access to Taunt, and key resistances to Fighting-, Fairy-, and Bug-type moves. As with any Pokemon, though, Crobat isn't without its flaws, and these must be addressed when considering it for your team. A Stealth Rock weakness, overall average stats aside from its Speed, and weaknesses to common Ice-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves make it difficult for Crobat to stand out among its competition. It also has trouble dealing with Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon, and despite its incredible Speed, priority moves, barring Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, will chip away at its health.

Don't let these shortcomings discourage you, however, as Crobat has all it needs to stand out in the form of some newly buffed tools at its disposal. Defog now allows it to clear hazards from both sides of the field as well as dual screens, while its ability Infiltrator allows it to hit foes behind Substitutes, such as Gengar, Scolipede, and Trevenant. Toxic now has perfect accuracy when used by Crobat; in conjunction with Infiltrator, this allows it to be very annoying, spreading status through teams regardless of Substitutes. With everything it has in its arsenal, Crobat is able to find a spot for any team looking to deal with with numerous defensive and offensive Pokemon, while keeping entry hazards clear for its teammates.

Moves
========

Brave Bird is a hard-hitting Flying STAB which allows Crobat to damage and even revenge kill frail Pokemon who don't resist it, such as Alakazam, Greninja, and Lucario. Brave Bird is also good for hitting Pokemon Crobat would commonly switch into, namely Grass- and Fighting-types. Roost heals Crobat back up and allows it to keep going, which is absolutely vital given its Stealth Rock weakness. Defog is a must-have, as it allows Crobat to take on a more utility-based role for the team by removing hazards from both sides. Taunt is preferred for the 4th moveslot as it allows this set to hinder defensive teams by preventing status moves and setup, working well with Defog as it helps Crobat stop hazard users such as Ferrothorn with ease. Toxic can be used to whittle down walls and defensive Pokemon, as well as hitting Pokemon behind Substitutes. U-turn can be used in the last moveslot if gaining momentum is absolutely important. This allows Crobat to function as part of a potential VoltTurn core with its teammates and help them maintain the advantage against Pokemon whom Crobat can force out. Lastly, Super Fang can also be used, because with Taunt and Brave Bird, it becomes much more of a pain to switch into Crobat, even for Steel-types.

Set Details
========

Black Sludge is useful for giving Crobat passive recovery. The given EVs and nature maximize bulk while allowing Crobat to outpace Noivern, the fastest threat whom Crobat can afford to deal with and get a fast Brave Bird off on while still allowing Crobat to OHKO Trevenant and Alakazam and 2HKO Greninja, specially defensive Tentacruel, offensive Starmie, Conkeldurr, Mega Venusaur, and Lucario with Brave Bird. Infiltrator is a must-have ability since it allows Crobat to beat Substitute users, and Inner Focus is generally inferior and more situational in comparison. 4 Special Defense EVs ensure that opposing Genesect get an Attack boost from Download; this is useful since Crobat 4x resists U-turn, and doesn't want to take a boosted Thunderbolt or Ice Beam, though it must be wary of sets carrying Iron Head. Bear in mind, though, that Crobat's EVs aren't set entirely in stone, and can be customized specifically for the needs of the team. For instance, a spread of 252 HP / 58 SpD / 200 Spe may be more optimal for maximizing bulk for a full utility-based role, though the loss of power in Brave Bird will be significant. An offensive EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can also be used to maximize Crobat's strength and speed, allowing it to outpace even base 70 Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf, though Crobat will lose out on a lot of bulk, and the extra Speed does not help it outrun many other relevant threats.

Usage Tips
========

This set can be seen as a "glue" for teams that have issues with both heavily defensive teams and frail offensive hitters, as it does a decent job of handling both; as such, the moves can be easily adjusted if there are certain threats your team needs to deal with more effectively. For instance, if you are already running a Rapid Spin user, Toxic can be used over Defog, and with Roost and Taunt, Crobat can shut down any wall that isn't immune to Toxic and keep it from healing itself. It's preferred to take out the opponent's Stealth Rock user before using Defog, otherwise you risk compromising Crobat's bulk to repeated switch-ins to Stealth Rock. Try not to use the move beforehand unless it is absolutely necessary. Despite Crobat's incredible Speed, it is highly prone to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users. If you run U-turn, hard switching is often advised rather than attempting to stomach a blow from an offensive Pokemon and U-turn, even if you're anticipating a resisted hit. When playing defensively, Crobat needs all the HP it can hang on to given its Stealth Rock weakness and opposing offensive pressure that can keep it from using Roost. Don't hesitate to go for Taunt against most defensive Pokemon, even if they are capable of dealing a hard blow; between Taunt and Roost, you'll be able to shrug off damage and maintain the advantage against most walls. Crobat also functions as a solid counter to Gliscor, due to being immune to both Earthquake and Toxic, while stopping it from doing anything with Taunt. Be wary of sets carrying Ice Fang, though, as they can eventually wear down Crobat and force it to Roost, possibly taking it out with an Earthquake, while taking little in return from Brave Bird thanks to Poison Heal.

Team Options
========

Though Crobat's typing offers it numerous weaknesses, it has resistances that allow it to fit into teams and cover up holes very easily. A teammate who can deal with Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon is absolutely mandatory, as they are hard stops to Crobat. Magnezone is a solid partner in this regard since Magnet Pull lets it reliably trap and kill a number of Steel-type Pokemon, while beating Rock-type Pokemon with STAB Flash Cannon on top of resisting all four of Crobat's weaknesses by itself. Despite having a shared Psychic weakness, Conkeldurr works well with Crobat as it not only lures out Mega Venusaur, who can be beaten by Crobat, but it deals with Zapdos, Heatran, Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Bisharp with ease. Conkeldurr's access to Guts also means it can utilize status spread by Heatran, Zapdos, or Rotom-W and hit even harder. As mentioned, Crobat is a solid Gliscor check, so physical attackers who have trouble breaking through it, such as Swords Dance Aegislash, Garchomp, Mega Mawile, and Bisharp, are all partners who can take advantage of Crobat's support. Crobat is also able to plow down most Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Breloom, Trevenant, Venusaur, Celebi, Conkeldurr, and Lucario with Brave Bird so Pokemon who appreciate their removal, such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, Quagsire, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon, work with Crobat effectively. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock who can take advantage of its Defog support also work well, such as Volcarona, Dragonite, Charizard, and Thundurus, since they all have an easier time sweeping with hazards missing from their side of the field.

Other Options
########

Crobat's movepool is somewhat shallow and doesn't offer too many other choices for it to use. Venom Drench is an interesting new move it gained this generation that allows it to significantly cripple any poisoned attackers, possibly forcing them back out in the long run while racking up hazard damage. A Choice Band set consisting of Brave Bird, Cross Poison/Super Fang, U-turn, and Sleep Talk can be used, though it is highly outclassed by Pokemon such as Staraptor and Talonflame, who both possess better coverage and are able to hit significantly harder. In a similar regard, Sharp Beak allows Crobat to hit harder with Brave Bird with little cost to its staying power, but it will greatly miss the passive recovery from Black Sludge. Crobat does have access to Nasty Plot and Heat Wave, enabling it to take on most Steel-types barring Heatran, but it is heavily outclassed as a Nasty Plot sweeper by Pokemon such as Mega Lucario, Thundurus, and even Togekiss, who all possess better Special Attack stats and coverage.


Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Most Steel-types in general are able to counter Crobat and force it out thanks to their resistance to Brave Bird and immunity to Toxic; examples include Heatran, Magnezone, Jirachi, Skarmory, Aegislash, Klefki, and Bisharp. Bisharp is especially dangerous as it not only forces Crobat out for a free turn, but its Defiant ability allows it to switch in on Defog and get a free +2 Attack boost, making it an immediate threat for your team to deal with. Ferrothorn and Forretress are neutral to Brave Bird but are still able to take a hit with ease and deal significant damage to Crobat with Gyro Ball. Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs ability is especially discouraging to Crobat.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Rhyperior, Aerodactyl, and Barbaracle are able to stomach a Brave Bird and either trap Crobat with Pursuit in Tyranitar's case, KO with Stone Edge, or set up on it while forcing it out with ease. However, all of them must be wary of switching into a Toxic.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Zapdos, Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Mega Manectric are able to switch in freely and KO Crobat with Thunderbolt or force it out and gain momentum with Volt Switch. However, they also have to be wary of a surprise Toxic on the switch-in.

**Stealth Rock**: Crobat has a painful Stealth Rock weakness, so this often can render it easier to take down for some offensive threats. This, coupled with Brave Bird's recoil, can often mean Crobat may be KOed easily if it fails to net a much-needed KO with Brave Bird.

**Priority Attacks**: Crobat resists no priority outside of Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, meaning a boosted hit can leave a dent in it, allowing Pokemon such as Talonflame, Scizor, and Mamoswine to pick Crobat off. Extremespeed Genesect is also a noteworthy issue for Crobat since the given EV spread gives it an Attack boost from Download.

**Revenge Killing**: Crobat can be revenge killed easily by Pokemon such as Choice Band Talonflame as well as Choice Scarf users such as Genesect, Terrakion, Tyranitar, and Garchomp. Faster threats such as Mega Manectric, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Alakazam are able to outspeed Crobat and OHKO with their respective STABs as well.
