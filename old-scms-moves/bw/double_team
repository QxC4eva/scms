<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's evasion stat by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Double Team has long been a banned move from the competitive scene. It breaks the Evasion Clause that is generically applied to nearly all Smogon battles. It is considered unhealthy for a skill-based metagame, since it rewards luck instead of skill, while taking the battle from both players' control and making the game (even more) luck based. It created situations where the crucial miss changed the outcome of a match. For these reasons it is practically never seen in this competitive environment.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it can still be used in Ubers and on Random Match-ups on Wi-Fi, where the Evasion Clause does not exist. There, you can use something like Sand Veil Gliscor, with BrightPowder, in a sandstorm and try to annoy your opponent to death. However, this strategy is frowned upon as it is not guaranteed to always work.</p>
