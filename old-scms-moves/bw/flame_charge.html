<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 100% chance to boost the user's Speed by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rarely seen, the usefulness of this move is debatable. It can be used by powerful Pokemon, such as Heatran or Chandelure, to set up a sweep, but is usually outclassed by moves such as Rock Polish and Shell Smash, which boost the Speed stat two stages. An important thing to note is that Flame Charge will not boost the user's Speed if the attack does not execute successfully.</p>
