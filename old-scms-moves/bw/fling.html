<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Fling is most famously seen on Gliscor. Holding a Toxic Orb, Gliscor can activate its Poison Heal ability, then Fling away the Orb, potentially inflicting Toxic poison on a target. Once Gliscor is no longer holding an item, the Base Power of its STAB Acrobatics will double.</p>

<p>Flinging an Iron Ball generates a 130 Base Power Dark-type attack, but will halve the user's Speed until Flung. Yet, this is still an option for Pokemon that are desperate to get rid of Psychic- or Ghost-type threats and have no other move with which to break through them. An example is Hitmonlee in RU, where Flinging an Iron Ball at Misdreavus will put the Ghost into KO range of Stone Edge, where before Hitmonlee would face getting burned by Will-O-Wisp before being able to KO it.</p>
