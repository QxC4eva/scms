<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In past generations Thunder lived in relative obscurity due to its poor accuracy, with nearly all players opting to choose the more reliable, and still powerful, Thunderbolt instead. However, everything has changed in BW with the prominence of Drizzle in the OU metagame. Thanks to the constant rain available to players, Thunder is seen much more in the metagame than in the past, due to Thunder having perfect accuracy, leaving little reason to drop it in favor of Thunderbolt. A Nasty Plot-boosted Thunder is even one of the main reasons why Thundurus was banned from OU (of course other factors were involved). Thunder even sees more use in the lower tiers, RU in particular, due to Galvantula being able to take advantage of the move thanks to Compoundeyes boosting the accuracy of Thunder up to 91%.</p>

<p>Of course, Thunder still sees a ton of use in Ubers, as it did in DPP, thanks in large part to the near omnipresence of Drizzle Kyogre. Thunder is one of the most dangerous weapons a Pokemon can wield in Ubers to take down the titan, as well as many of the other Ubers that sport a weakness to Electricity, such as Lugia and Ho-Oh.</p>
