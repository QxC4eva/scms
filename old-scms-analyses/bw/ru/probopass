[Overview]

<p>Although Probopass looks nothing more than a soot-ridden chimney, its defensive stats and support movepool surpass that of most other Pokemon in the tier. Furthermore, Probopass's ability, Magnet Pull, allows it to trap Steel-types, such as Ferroseed and Klinklang. However, not all is grand for this old timer, as its base HP is disappointing, and it lacks any sort of recovery outside of Rest. In addition, Probopass has a double weakness to common Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, leaving it vulnerable to a lot of common moves in the tier. In a tier filled with Fighting-types, such as Gallade, Throh, and Hitmonlee, it faces problems setting up, and it doesn't last very long. Probopass is used only for its ability, Magnet Pull; otherwise, it's completely outclassed by Aggron.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to its massive defensive stats and decent typing, Probopass can take on threats such as Rotom, Entei, Moltres, and Manectric with little trouble. Stealth Rock provides added support for Probopass's teammates, helping them secure certain KOs and 2HKOs. Thunder Wave cripples dangerous threats, and makes up for Probopass's pitiful Speed. Toxic enables Probopass to take on bulkier walls, and slowly drain them of their health. Power Gem is used for reliable STAB, and it deals an immense amount of damage to Moltres. Earth Power allows Probopass to hit Fire- and Steel-types for super effective damage, such as Entei and Steelix. Thunderbolt hits Flying- and Water-types, and provides excellent type coverage when used with Earth Power. The only thing that makes Probopass better than Aggron is Magnet Pull, so take advantage of it whenever you can by trapping Steel-types. Finally, Leftovers give Probopass recovery every turn, while Air Balloon allows it to avoid Ground-type attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on this set attempt to balance Probopass's defenses, while maximum HP is used to give it supreme bulk. A Careful nature can be used in place of Calm if you wish to run a physical set with Earthquake and Stone Edge, though most Steel-types are weaker on their Special Defense. Gravity can be used in any of Probopass's moveslots to provide team support, and it works well in conjunction with Earth Power, as it hits Levitate Rotom for super effective damage. Rest and Sleep Talk can somewhat remedy Probopass's lack of recovery, though they're pretty unreliable. Similarly, Probopass can use Pain Split to restore some of its health, but the opponent can take advantage of this by sending in a weakened Pokemon.</p>

<p>Pokemon who can switch into Ground- and Fighting-type moves are helpful as they keep Probopass alive longer. Rotom is a great choice as it can take on a variety of roles such as dual screener, sweeper, or Choice abuser. Rotom also acts as an excellent spinblocker, which ensures Stealth Rock stays on the field.</p>

<p>Ghost-types, such as Spiritomb and Dusknoir, are recommended to keep Stealth Rock on the field, and the majority of them carry Will-O-Wisp to weaken physical attackers. Wish support is also helpful to keep Probopass alive longer, making Clefable and Leafeon great teammates. Unfortunately, Clefable shares a Fighting-type weakness with Probopass, but Leafeon on the other hand shares excellent defensive synergy with Probopass, as it resists Ground-type moves, and Probopass can switch into Ice-type moves aimed at it.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The goal of this set is to remove opposing Steel-types who slow down your team's sweep. These include Klinklang, Ferroseed, and Steelix. Taunt and Stealth Rock are the main reason to use this over Magneton, as well as Probopass's neutrality to Fire-type moves. Magnet Rise enables Probopass to avoid Ground-type moves, though it's unnecessary if it's holding an Air Balloon. Magnet Rise can then be replaced with Stealth Rock or Thunder Wave. Taunt stops Pokemon such as Ferroseed from setting up entry hazards, and it also stops Steelix from using Roar. Alternatively, Substitute can be used for protection from status, and it can give Probopass a life line against a dangerous switch-in. Hidden Power Fire is more useful to KO Ferroseed, though Earth Power is usually more reliable to hit Entei, Steelix, and Aggron. Power Gem and Thunderbolt provide additional coverage against Flying-types, such as Mandibuzz.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on this set are simple; by maximizing Probopass's HP and Special Attack stats, it poses a decent offensive threat, and it also has enough bulk to take on a variety of threats in RU. The choice between Hidden Power Fire and Earth Power is preferential, though here are some damage calculations to give you an idea of what each move can do.</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>252 SpA Modest Probopass Earth Power vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Steelix: 40.1% - 47.5%</li>
<li>252 SpA Modest Probopass Hidden Power Fire vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Steelix: 31.1% - 36.7%</li>
<li>252 SpA Modest Hidden Power Fire vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Ferroseed: 75.3% - 89%
</ul>

<p>Pokemon who can switch into Probopass's weaknesses are helpful. Mandibuzz can switch into Ground-type moves aimed at Probopass, and it has access to Taunt and Whirlwind to cripple and scout the opponent's team, respectively. Wish support helps Probopass survive longer, and this can be provided by Clefable and Leafeon. It should be noted, however, that Clefable shares a Fighting-type weakness with Probopass. Finally, Pokemon who can sweep without the presence of Steel-types make great partners. Scyther has the power to sweep the opponent's team without the presence of Steelix, while Sawsbuck can set up Swords Dance and proceed to pummel the opponent's team.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Other than the moves listed above, Probopass's movepool isn't great. Volt Switch can be used to bring in a teammate unscathed, thanks to Probopass's low Speed, though it doesn't provide much coverage, and it isn't very useful on a Pokemon as slow as Probopass. Explosion provides Probopass's teammates with a safe switch in, though it's not very strong, and is generally a poor choice. Discharge has a nice paralysis rate, but it's fairly pointless when Probopass has access to Thunder Wave. AncientPower is a gimmick, though it provides STAB and has a 10% chance to boost all of its stats. Torment stops the opponent from repeating moves, though it's pretty pointless. Block and Toxic can turn Probopass into a staller, but most opponents will switch in a counter immediately, so Probopass will be stuck with a dangerous threat.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Probopass isn't difficult to counter; its offensive stats are lackluster, and it has dual weaknesses to common Ground- and Fighting-type moves. Ground-types, such as Sandslash and Golurk, can switch into any of Probopass's moves, hit it super effectively, or set up against it. Fighting-types, such as Throh and Hariyama, have good defensive stats, don't mind paralysis, and have powerful STAB moves to KO Probopass. Poliwrath can beat any sets without Thunderbolt, and it can set up Substitutes in Probopass's face. Bouffalant can take a hit thanks to its good defenses, and it can hit Probopass with Earthquake. Probopass won't be doing a lot to Pokemon with high Special Defense, so Pokemon such as Clefable and Slowking are good checks. If worst comes to worst, just Taunt it or put it to sleep.</p>
