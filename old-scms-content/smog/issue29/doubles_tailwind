<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For those of you that still don't know it, Tailwind is a Flying-type move that doubles the Speed of every Pok&eacute;mon in your party for four turns, including in the count the turn it's used in, so essentially three turns. In singles, this move is more of a niche for certain Pok&eacute;mon to fill and rarely sees competitive use. But in Doubles metagames, this move creates an entire playstyle, and a very dangerous playstyle at that. Speed control is a giant part of Doubles and being able to double your own team's Speed could result in a victory for you. The move turns slower sweepers like Heracross, Conkeldeurr, and Hydregion into some of the biggest threats that can put your opponent into submission with the three turns they get.</p>

<p>Many different Pok&eacute;mon are able to use the move Tailwind, but certain users outshine others in the Doubles metagame, whether from overall bulk, Prankster as an ability, or surprise factor. In the follow article, we're going to outline some of the best at setting Tailwind as well as some of the most dangerous Pok&eacute;mon within it.</p>

<h2>The Setters</h2>
<p>Each of the Tailwind setters and users have unique traits that make it shine over the others; the key is to choose ones with strong synergy that are able to overwhelm the sort of teams that are popular at the time. For instance, Tornadus has Prankster, while Togekiss has an amazing bulk and Follow Me. Other setters have different characteristics that set them apart from these two, so let's take a look at some of the pros and cons of the best setters in the metagame.</p>

<h3>Togekiss</h3>
<p>Togekiss is one of the best Tailwind setters in the metagame. Thanks to its fantastic bulk, a great movepool, and great synergy with some of the sweepers, it's one of the best support Pok&eacute;mon you can ask for.</p>
<img src="/download/sprites/bw/473.png" alt="" />
<p>Togekiss @ Sitrus Berry<br />
Ability: Serene Grace<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 92 Spe / 168 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Tailwind<br />
- Follow Me<br />
- Air Slash<br />
- Protect / Thunder Wave</p>

<p>This is one of the setters that will rely on the pure bulk it has to set up Tailwind. After setting up, it can utilize Follow Me to lure hits away from sweepers so they can stay alive as long as possible. Sitrus Berry is used on this set to get health back quickly to survive a couple of turns more. Togekiss can also use the Thunder Wave and Air Slash combination to slow down and flinch opponents to death, the infamous paraflinch combo. The EVs on this set are very specific; the Speed EVs allow you to outrun Pok&eacute;mon such as Rotom and Cresselia, as well as being able to lure Fake Outs from Hitmontop that run 168 Speed. 248 EVs in HP lets your health be an odd number, thus taking less damage overall from sandstorm and hail. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to maximize Togekiss's survivability.</p>

<h3>Tornadus</h3>
<p>Tornadus is one of the two setters who can use the Prankster ability to get Tailwind up with priority, meaning it will be able to set up Tailwind every turn as long as it's alive. It can also carry Taunt and can play an offensive role as well as supporting its team at the same time.</p>
<img src="/download/sprites/bw/671.png" alt="" />
<p>Tornadus @ Flying Gem<br />
Ability: Prankster<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Tailwind<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Acrobatics<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>The EVs on this set are very basic because that's all Tornadus really needs, unless it's running some special attacks such as Heat Wave. The main philosophy behind this set is to use Taunt to shut down Trick Room and other support Pok&eacute;mon. It's a very suitable Pok&eacute;mon to counter Trick Room teams, being able to stop their setters save Mental Herb users, like Dusknoir, at the same time that it deals huge damage with its STAB Acrobatics.</p>

<h3>Salamence</h3>
<p>A Tailwind setter that can catch people off guard is one that works just as well as the others. Salamence is known as an offensive powerhouse and is a feared sweeper when seen in Team Preview. In Doubles though, Salamence can play a completely different roll. Thanks to Intimidate, Salamence can shrug off any physical attacker and still get Tailwind up.</p>
<img src="/download/sprites/bw/373.png" alt="" />
<p>Salamence @ Yache Berry<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Tailwind<br />
- Heat Wave / Hidden Power Flying<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>The feared dragon's main problem is a glaring gargantuan weakness to Ice-type attacks. This is where the Yache Berry comes into play. Heat Wave is a interesting move for Salamence to use, as it hits both of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon in Doubles, and Dragon Pulse is for some reliable STAB. Max Speed is good to have on this set so you can get Tailwind up before getting hit, and Special Attack is maxed out to boost your power. Alternatively, Hidden Power Flying can be used in place of Heat Wave as another STAB to help deal with Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Scrafty.</p>

<h3>Latias</h3>
<p>The last Pok&eacute;mon we want to mention in this article as a Tailwind setter is one of the Lati twins. Latias is a very versatile Pok&eacute;mon in the Doubles metagame, as it can dent teams and it can support many Pok&eacute;mon due to its amazing movepool.</p>
<img src="/download/sprites/bw/380.png" alt="" />
<p>Latias @ Haban Berry<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Tailwind<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Helping Hand<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>The EVs for the set are very simple. 252 Speed with a Timid nature is used to maximize the Speed. 248 HP is so you land on an odd number and take less damage from sandstorm and hail, and the remaining 8 EVs are going to go into Special Attack. The moveset on this Latias focuses more on support than actually dealing damage. Tailwind is, of course, the staple of the set, while Helping Hand boosts a teammate's Attack to deal maxmum amounts of damage. The Haban Berry lets you survive super effective Dragon-type hits that would otherwise kill Latias, such as a Dragon Gem Draco Meteor from her brother Latios. Latias can set up Tailwind and return the favor with a Dragon Pulse of her own.</p>

<p>This shows you how all setters fill a different role. Some can play offense while managing to get up Tailwind well other rely completely on their bulk to get up Tailwind. However these 4 aren't the only Tailwind setters you can use; there are other good ones as well, such as Crobat, Zapdos, Suicune, and Whimsicott, just to name a few. Now that we got through the support section of the article, I think it's about time we get into the dangerous threats that Tailwind creates. Shall we?</p>

<h2>Tailwind Sweepers</h2>
<p>The following Pok&eacute;mon aren't in the team to set Tailwind, they are in it to profit from the Speed boost to sweep the entirety of the opposing team. Pok&eacute;mon with high Attack and mediocre Speed that are often overlooked can go from mediocre team member to unstoppable sweeper in a mere turn. Either offensive sweepers or further team support, the following Pok&eacute;mon should be taken dead seriously, because they can wreak havoc on your team and wreck your Pok&eacute;mon like they were paper foil.</p>

<h3>Victini</h3>
<p>This little fairy is as cute as it is deadly. Boasting 100 stats across the board and several of the most powerful moves in game, Tailwind is only an extra step in allowing it to destroy opposing teams and break any walls.</p>
<img src="/download/sprites/bw/522.png" alt="" />
<p>Victini @ Fire Gem<br />
Ability: Victory Star<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- V-create<br />
- Bolt Strike<br />
- Brick Break<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>As calling as the V-create button is, shiny red and reminding you of its 180 BP, you must save this move. Fire Gem V-create is the most powerful single Fire-type attack. If you're under sun, well, even the mighty Kingdra gets 2HKOed. Add in a Helping Hand and the dragon-water horse-thing will cry for mercy. While 100 Speed is already pretty good, Tailwind makes Victini one of the fastest sweepers available, being able to damage practically everything super effectively or neutrally with V-create, Bolt Strike, and Zen Headbutt.</p>

<h3>Hydreigon</h3>
<p>Often overlooked, this dark dragon has a nice typing and deadly STABs to prove its worth at anytime. Add in the Tailwind Speed boost, and it's stay on the field won't go unnoticed.</p>
<img src="/download/sprites/bw/665.png" alt="" />
<p>Hydreigon @ Dragon Gem / Dark Gem<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Modest Nature / Rash for Superpower<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Dark Pulse<br />
- Heat Wave / Superpower / Focus Blast<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>Its Draco Meteor will seriously dent or KO a lot of opponents, while it can use Dark Pulse with Dark Gem to seriously harm Cresselia. Heat Wave is a nice addition to its moveset, being a strong spread move that can damage several Doubles threats, such as Scizor, who otherwise threatens Hydreigon with its Bug Bite or U-turn. Superpower or Focus Blast will let it deal with Tyranitar and Heatran, another two problematic Pok&eacute;mon in Doubles. It can use Protect in the Tailwind setting turn to remain unharmed, ready to keep up the relentless sweeping.</p>

<h3>Zapdos</h3>
<p>Even though Zapdos can set Tailwind, it can also use it to great extent. It has nice Speed, nice Special Attack, and a very precise movepool.</p>
<img src="/download/sprites/bw/145.png" alt="" />
<p>Zapdos @ Life Orb / Electric Gem<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt / Discharge<br />
- Heat Wave<br />
- Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Flying / Tailwind<br />
- Protect / Roost</p>

<p>Offensive Zapdos can be a back up setter if you decide to give up Hidden Power. Discharge can be used alongside the powerful Ground-types of the tier, Garchomp, Landorus, Landorus-T, and Excadrill, while an Electric Gem Thunderbolt can deal massive single-target damage. Heat Wave is another nice spread move that nails Breloom and Scizor, and Hidden Power Flying gets Hitmontop by surprise and easily OHKOes all Breloom; however, Hidden Power Ice gets rid of the Ground-types that plague Zapdos. The choice between Protect or Roost depends on your playstyle. While Protect can be used against Rock Slide or Stone Edge, Roost will help you against those in Tailwind and will also heal off the neutral damage that piles up.</p>

<h3>Volcarona</h3>
<p>The versatile dreaded OU moth is also a powerful presence in Doubles, where Stealth Rock sees a dramatically decreased usage, making its use easier. Its Heat Wave is devastating, its power with Tailwind, nigh unstoppable.</p>
<img src="/download/sprites/bw/667.png" alt="" />
<p>Volcarona @ Fire Gem / Life Orb / Bug Gem / Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Flame Body<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Heat Wave<br />
- Bug Buzz<br />
- Giga Drain / Quiver Dance<br />
- Protect / Hurricane (situational against rain / if you use rain)</p>

<p>Volcarona has many options. You can team up with Togekiss or Amoonguss and use Rage Powder or Follow Me to set up a Quiver Dance, setting up and making the opponent cry. This is only good if you can stop Trick Room teams, though. Heat Wave is devastating, Bug Buzz deals good damage to Cresselia, Latios, Latias, and opposing Hydreigon. Giga Drain helps you get past rain teams with their pesky Politoeds, but beware of Kingdra, as it can stop Volcarona's sweeping career with ease.</p>

<h3>Kyurem-B</h3>
<p>Kyurem-B is pure power, only hindered by a lack of Speed normally, but both hard-hitting and fast in a Tailwind team. Its typing provides Kyurem-B with nice resistances, although Hitmontop poses a problem.</p>
<img src="/download/sprites/bw/685.png" alt="" />
<p>Kyurem-B @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Teravolt<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Lonely Nature<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Fusion Bolt<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Outrage</p>

<p>With this set you can overcome Thundurus-T's Volt Absorb and OHKO many Pok&eacute;mon in Doubles with Outrage. Its uninvested Ice Beam deals with problematic Landorus, Landorus-T, Salamence, and Dragonite, all of whom can trouble Kyurem-B otherwise. Its main weakness is being paralyzed; that's why you need to destroy Thundurus as fast as possible if it's present on the enemy team. Other than that, Kyurem-B is an excellent offensive Pok&eacute;mon that will make all kinds of teams tremble.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While those are the main Pok&eacute;mon making use of the crucial tactic that is Speed control, there are many more that could use a Speed boost to increase their offensive or support abilities. While Amoonguss has no use for Speed, it can support a Tailwind team perfectly with Rage Powder and Spore. Heatran and Heracross are both a tad slow, so they welcome Tailwind to increase their great strength. While fighting in Doubles, pulling off your Speed control tactic is very important; this is why you have to control Taunt users, shut down Trick Room users, since Trick Room makes Tailwind useless, and find a way to stop Thunder Wave.</p>
