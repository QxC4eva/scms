<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that causes partial trapping moves, namely Bind, Clamp, Fire Spin, Magma Storm, Sand Tomb, Whirlpool, and Wrap, to always trap and damage the opponent for the maximum of 7 turns.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Partial trapping moves are not often seen competitively, for the simple reason that they do very little damage to the opponent, take up a whole moveslot, and likely will trap something that can actually fight back (if the opponent could not do anything to you, they would either switch out or stay in expecting to be KOed, and getting rid of an opponent's Pokemon is almost always the more favorable turn of events), so you will waste a turn and a moveslot doing very little, especially as all effects of these moves are lost when the user switches out. Even if these moves were commonly used, in BW their duration was extended to a minimum of four turns and you should not even need four turns to do whatever it is you happen to want to do with the opponent. Simply put, Binding Band outclasses it totally, and that's an item that nobody uses either.</p>
