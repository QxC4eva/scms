As you can see my leads hit hard with explosion and then bring in kyogre and hit hard and just try to sweep. I only used Azelf+Palkia leads round one and use Metagross+Gengar for the remainder of the tournament.


It all starts Friday. I wake up around 9 AM and head to the airport. I get there with about 30 minutes of waiting for the plane. I finally get to Dallas at like 5 PM and meet up with Alaka. We go get some ribs and then we go to his house. We hang out and play some video games/tcg for the remainder of the night and then we hit the sack excited for the next day.

So, its finally VGC time. I have been waiting for a while to play in it hoping to do well. Alaka and I head out to the convention center at 7:30 AM so we can watch Alaka's "Junior Squad." We watch Alaka's junior, who is using my team, to get in the finalist lounge first. We then head over to the "King of the Hill" side event. Alaka is on a 3 win streak when I play him and I just try to bring stuff to explode on him but he beats me with a crit <_< He eventually wins King of the Hill and then we just hang around until the junior finals. Alaka's junior made top 2 with my team.

We get in line with ImaWario, Seto Kaiba, and some of Alaka's tcg buddies. I met Calm_Lava and Werecario while waiting and got to talk to ImaWario. Then the real fun begins when we finally get to play.

Round 1: vs Togekiss Cresselia ??? ???
I start off with azelf+palkia but he predicts me and protects with togekiss and gets a light screen up with cresselia. I was thinking I am screwed but I was determined to get far in this tournament. I just start double teaming the togekiss and the other pokes that come it after it. It came down to my palkia vs his cresselia with 25% hp so I won this one barely.

Round 2: Vs ??? ??? Alakazam ???
I just remember sweeping through his team pretty easily.

Round 3: vs A smogon Lurker
So I walk up and the judge was like, "So I guess its Tyler v Tyler. I know Tyler isgonna win." I had a laugh and then the guy was like, "Are you Tyler422?" I was like, "Yup". He said, "Great, I really didn't want to play you." I liked hearing people being afraid of me. :D I pull of the meta+gengar and just sweep though him. I don't remember his smogon name, but if you are reading this post and I will change it for you. :D

Round 4: Vs Lickilicky Bronzong Slowking ???
So this was probably my easiest battle. I start by hammer arming the the licklicky for 65% damage and taunted the bronzong so he didn't get trick room. I then shadow ball the bronzong and explode killing both. He brings in slowking and something else and I bring in kyogre and kill his other guy while he trick rooms with slowking. I just double team it for the finalist lounge.

Me and Marriland

Finalist Lounge:
I go get hack checked and at the same time OmegaDonut was doing the same. We shake hands and talk a little and then he goes over on a beanbag and sleeps. Even though Alaka got out 4th round, he sits in the lounge with me waiting for all the games to finish. There was 37 people in the lounge but luckily I got a bye. 

Top 32: Vs Tangrowth Groudon Azelf Ho oh
He leads with tangrowth and groudon while I lead with my usuals, Gengar and Metagross. I explode and shadow ball the groudon but neither die because tangrowth relfected. I bring in kyogre and he switches out groudon to azelf while I kill tangrowth and damage azelf. He brings back in Groudon which seals my loss. I kill groudon while he kills gengar. I bring in ludicolo and he brings in ho oh. He then stalls me out with roost+protect and brave bird. 

All in all it was a good time and I hope to see you guys at nationals.
