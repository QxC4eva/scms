<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The user recovers half of the HP lost by the target, rounded up. If Big Root is held by the user, the HP recovered is 1.3x normal, rounded half down. If the target has the ability Liquid Ooze, no HP will be restored and the user will take damage instead.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Horn Leech is an extremely useful move unique to Sawsbuck. It is powerful, accurate, and its secondary healing pairs well with a Life Orb, aiding Sawsbuck's sweeping potential greatly. It is also the only physical Grass-type move that Sawsbuck learns, and is an excellent choice on every set.</p>
