<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This Uber team relies on the unorthodox strategy of abusing Jumpluff's subseeding powers in the sun with support form Wobbuffet. This team may appear to be gimmicky at first, but it isn't. This is because the team has been successful enough to get me up to #5 on the leader board. This team has several obvious weaknesses that shall be discussed in the conclusion, but I have been able to work around most of these weaknesses. Team raters, please note that there are 3 pokemon that can not be replaced; <strong>Groudon, Jumpluff, and Wobbuffet</strong>. This is because they are vital to pulling off this teams strategy.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/389.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Deoxys-S</strong> @ Focus Sash<br/ >
Ability: Pressure<br/ >
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br/ >
Jolly Nature<br/ >
- Spikes<br/ >
- Taunt<br/ >
- Superpower<br/ >
- Ice Beam</p>

<p>I'm sure this is going to get a lot of criticism as a lead, but I have some specific reasons for using it. This Deoxys-e lacks Stealth Rock because often times, people use leads like Choice Scarf Darkrai to stop Deoxys-e. Its not the end of the world if I fail to set-up Spikes, but Stealth Rock is very important to this team, thus I can't afford to put it on Deoxys. A good thing about this lead is that thanks to many leads focusing on beating Choice Scarf Darkrai (like lum berry Diagla), I often can get 2-3 layers of spikes up. Vs. Darkari, I attempt to set up Spikes as a way to scout its hold item. If it has Choice Scarf and Dark Void misses, Wobbuffet can switch in and PP stall it to death. If it is slower than me, then I let Deoxys fall asleep and revenge kill with Palkia. Vs Choice Scarf Mewtwo, I let it Shadow ball me and switch to Blissey. Taunt is there to try and win a speedtie agaisnt an opposing Deoxys-e. If I win the tie, people often switch in Tyranitar or Rayquaza, which is what Superpower and Ice Punch are for. If I lose the speed tie, all I can do is switch in Palkia or Groudon to kill it. The main reasons I'm not using Darkrai as a lead is because he can't set-up entry hazards and Dark Void interfears with Jumpluff's Sleep Powder.</p>

<p><strong>Groudon</strong> @ Leftovers<br/ >
Ability: Drought<br/ >
EVs: 252 HP / 156 Atk / 42 Def / 60 SpD<br/ >
Adamant Nature<br/ >
- Earthquake<br/ >
- Dragon Claw<br/ >
- Stealth Rock<br/ >
- Fire Punch</p>

<p>This is my Stealth Rocker, support Groudon. Groudon is very important to this team for a number of reasons. It provides the sunlight that makes Jumpluff so dangerous. If I screw up and Palkia dies, Groudon can revenge kill Rayquazas (this is very risky, Rayquazas do a lot of damage to Groudon). Most importantly, Stealth Rock is very important to this team. I replaced Roar with Fire Punch because despite Roar's usefulness, Forrtress is a huge threat to this team. The Evs were taken from the Strategy Pokedex.</p>

<p><strong>Jumpluff</strong> @ Leftovers<br/ >
Ability: Chlorophyll<br/ >
EVs: 188 Def / 68 SpD / 252 Spe<br/ >
Timid Nature<br/ >
- Encore<br/ >
- Substitute<br/ >
- Leech Seed<br/ >
- Sleep Powder</p>

<p>Description: The best Pok&eacute;mon in DPP, hands (flippers?) down. There is no way that I can aptly describe its awesomeness with mere words, but if you've ever had that euphoric feeling upon seeing Blissey's health bar go all the way from full to 30%ish when it comes into a full health Modest Choice Specs Water Spout in the rain with SR down, you know what a BEAST it is. Water/Ice/Electric gets near-perfect coverage (I'm looking at you Chinchou/Lanturn/Shedinja), with Water Spout for when your HP is high and Surf for when it gets low. Having Kyogre out on the field in an advantageous situation, which is really pretty easy to do, immediately puts the opponent on the defensive and gives me the all-important momentum that is crucial to winning Uber battles. Practically nothing can OHKO this monster, so if I'm in a 1-1 situation with Kyogre left at near-full health (and it has happened several times), you might as well say gg. There's really no reason NOT to use this Pok&eacute;mon - it's simply the best there is.</p>

<p>Other Info: With Choice Specs, a Modest nature, and 252 EVs, Kyogre's Special Attack hits a whopping 657, which is just obscene. I didn't see the need in maxing Speed because it would only help in forcing ties with stuff like other SpecsOgre and fast Giratina-O, and I wouldn't want to be in those situations anyway. Therefore, I gave it 36 Speed EVs to beat out support Groudon with 32 and put the rest into HP for added bulk. Kyogre is nicknamed "Neptune" after the ninth planet, which in turn gets its name from the Roman god of the sea.</p>

<p><strong>Wobbuffet</strong> @ Leftovers<br/ >
Ability: Shadow Tag<br/ >
EVs: 28 HP / 252 Def / 228 SpD<br/ >
Bold Nature<br/ >
- Counter<br/ >
- Mirror Coat<br/ >
- Encore<br/ >
- Safeguard</p>

<p>Wobbuffet may seem like a bad addition to this team, as it focus on use entery hazards and Subseeding to rack up damage. This coudn't be further from the truth for a couple of reasons. First of all, Wobbuffet often switches in on pokemon like Lugia, and thanks to Whirlwinds negative priority, Wobbuffet often encores a support or status move. This not only gives Jumpluff a free substitute, but it also forces the oppent to switch! When I'm in a tight situation, I can also use Wobbuffet as a make-shift revenge killer. I can't do this too often, as Wobbuffet isn't invinciable. It may seem strange to make Wobbuffet bold instead of Calm, but I have found that strong special attackers like Choice Specs Kyogre and Scarf Palkia (in the rain) are too powerful for even Calm Wobbuffet to handle, but Bold Wobbuffet can use support Groudon's as Jumpluff set-up time via Encoring Earthquake, plus I have a small chance of surviving a Swords Dance dragon claw from Rayquaza. The Evs let Wobuuffet have max leftovers recovery, thus stalling Chice Scarf Darkrais locked into Drak Void is esaier.</p>

<p><strong>Blissey</strong> @ Leftovers<br/ >
Ability: Natural Cure<br/ >
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD<br/ >
Calm Nature<br/ >
- Wish<br/ >
- Protect<br/ >
- Seismic Toss<br/ >
- Toxic</p>

<p>Blissey is important to this team for a number of reasons. First of all, If I get rid of the oppents physical attackers (people love to switch them into Jumpluff for some reason), and weaken Kyogre, Blissey will often wall entire teams with no porblem. Secondly, Wish support is increadbly useful for this team, as it make Wobbuffet into even more of a cruel bitch! Toxic is there to wear down pokemon like Kyogre. I have been considering putting Ice Beam over Seismic Toss, as this can hit Rayquazas who think they have free set-up time. I am also considering puting Shed Shell on Blissey because of a huge increase of Tickle Wobbuffet I have been seeing, though I really don't like losing leftovers recovery.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/489.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Palkia</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br/ >
Ability: Pressure<br/ >
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br/ >
Timid Nature<br/ >
- Spacial Rend<br/ >
- Surf<br/ >
- Fire Blast<br/ >
- Draco Meteor</p>

<p>Finally, Palkia attempts to patch up some holes while providing some sort of offense unlike most of this team. Palkia's main duties are to switch in to Kyogre's Water Spout and Revenge kill Dragon Dance Rayquazas. Palkia can also revenge kill other threats, like Nasty Plot Darkrai. Too be honest, I'm really not sure what the moveset should be, but this one has been working fine so far. I can't be mixed, as things like Rayquaz√°'s Extreemspeed will screw me over. There is not much else to say here, Palkia just revenge kills certain problem pokemon.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Yeah, this team is very light on the offense, and a lot of pokemon are very nasty to it. But, some of them are able to be worked around. I have been thinking about makeing Groudon into a rock polisher, but than SR would have to go on something else. Overall, despite this team being very flawed, it has been extremly sucsessful and had gotten me up to #5 on the ladder (#6 as of now), so I must be doing something right!</p>
