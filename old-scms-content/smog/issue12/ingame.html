<p><strong>"A wild ????? appeared!"</strong> This must  be going through the minds of many of our readers as they attempt to  make their way through the wild grasses of the Isshu Region of Pokémon  Black and White. With countless new Pokémon and no familiar faces in  sight (not even a Zubat!), it is easy to get lost when putting a team  together. This article will cover some of the most useful and easily  incorporated Pokémon for the in-game journey. It should prove useful for  those looking to speed-run through the story arc, or else simply make  their in-game travels easier.</p>

<h2>Gotta Start Somewhere</h2>

<p>First, let us start with the most obvious point&mdash;the  starters. Tsutaja, Pokabu and Mijumaru step onto the stage as the fifth  generation's Grass-type, Fire-type, and Water-type starting Pokémon.  While this article will predominantly focus on exceptional in-game  Pokémon, no in-game discussion would be complete without a comparison  between starting Pokémon.</p>

<h3>Tsutaja</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_tsutajasprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the sleekest looking of the new trio also turns  out to be the one with the most problems. Tsutaja, just like its  predecessors, is cursed with the worst of the three attacking types,  Grass&mdash;whose poor coverage and defensive typing has  difficulties in the OU metagame as well. Tsutaja is blessed with a  useful stat distribution, giving it good bulk and speed that should give  its evolution Jaroda great potential for Leech Seed sets in  competition, but this is of much lesser value when trying to quickly  defeat opponents and progress through the game. Not only does Tsutaja  have wanting offensive stats, but it also has an extremely poor in-game  movepool. Slam (which Janobii does not even get until level 28) is the  only non-grass move it learns of fair Base Power. Its TM move  compatibility is also extremely lacking&mdash;is incompatible with  just about any offensive TM you will find in the early game (except for  Grass Knot). It should be noted that Tsutaja does get Growth, which now  boosts ATK and Sp.ATK, allowing you to make some fair use of Tackle.  Right... Tackle... Tsutaja is definitely the most difficult of the three  starters.</p>

<h3>Pokabu</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_pokabusprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Pokabu is a much more solid in-game Pokémon than Tsutaja. Upon  reaching level 17, it will evolve and gain a secondary Fighting-type,  and the Fighting attack Arm Thrust, giving it much more coverage. Both  its offensive and defensive stats are quite adequate for fighting  through the in-game journey. Unfortunately, Pokabu is no Chimchar. It  does not learn any other (better) Fighting-type moves naturally, missing  out on the critical Close Combat. It does however get Grass Knot, which  is a very early game TM that adds a lot to Pokabu's coverage.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_wotter2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<h3>Mijumaru</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_mijumarusprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Mijumaru is probably the best of the three starters in-game. At  level 17 it evolves and learns Shell Blade, whose 75 Power and 95  Accuracy can blast through the competition until you pick up the Surf  and Waterfall HMs. It also can learn Vengeance, a 70 Base Power  Normal-type attack whose TM appears very early in the game. With the  awesome power of Water/Normal coverage, Mijumaru and its evolutions will  have no trouble breaking the enemies before them, especially with their  powerful offensive stats. It also is compatible with Dig and Grass  Knot, both extremely early TMs that have great coverage with Water.  Revenge, Surf, Waterfall, and Strength all add to an impressive and  expansive in-game movepool. Using Mijumaru also means you can use Boappu  instead of Yannapu, who suffers many of the same weaknesses as  Tsutaja.</p>

<h2>The Rest</h2>

<h3>Hiappu/Boappu/Yanappu</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_hiappusprite.png" alt=""  /><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_boappusprite.png" alt=""  /><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_yanappusprite.png" alt=""  /></p>

<p>The three elemental monkeys add a new twist to the in-game.  When you reach Sayou City (the first Gym City), head to the north-east,  and a girl will ask you what your starter is. Depending on what starting  Pokémon you picked, she will give you the monkey that best covers that  starter's weakness. This is very useful for beating your rival Cheren in  battle in Sayou (who by then will have the super effective advantage  over your starter). Sayou City Gym also will use one of the monkeys  against you, whichever one is most effective against your starter, and  the surrounding grassy area is full of nothing but Normal-types. For all  these reasons, picking up one of the monkeys is extremely valuable.  They all have excellent speed, fair defenses, and good offensive stats  for both physical and special moves. They all also learn Cheer Up, Sayou  Gym's TM, which boosts both ATK and Sp.ATK. Hiyappu and Boappu also get  Grass Knot, giving them good coverage from the early game with  Water/Grass and Fire/Grass respectively. All of them can use Rock Smash  and Dig, which offer useful coverage early in the game.</p>

<p>Furthermore, two cities after Sayou, in Hiun City, a man at the  pier will give you an elemental stone to evolve your monkey should you  desire. They appear early, balance your starter, have great TM  compatibility and can be evolved at will&mdash;have there ever been  more useful in-game Pokémon before?</p>

<h3>Dokkora</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_dokkorasprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dokkora makes its first appearance in Yaguruma Forest (or at  the entrance of it), right outside Shippou City, the Normal-type Gym.  Not only does it appear at a fairly high level with perfect timing for  type match-up, it also already knows Low Kick and learns Rock Throw  after just two levels at 16. Rock/Fighting is fantastic coverage even in  competitive Pokémon, and is amazing in-game. Furthermore it gets two  fantastic abilities in Guts and Encourage. If you have Encourage, you  can use a 60 Base Power Rock Smash (base 90 with STAB), which is very  useful because of how small and light many in-game opponents are at that  point in the game. It also can use Cheer Up, and later learns Bulk Up.  It is unfortunate that it cannot use either Thief or Shadow Claw later  in the game, but Rock/Fighting coverage carries it throughout pretty  much the whole journey.</p>

<p>It eventually learns Rock Slide naturally (it evolves at the  relatively early level 25, and its evolutions learn Rock Slide at level  33), as well as Stone Edge in its later levels. Dotekkotsu is more than  strong enough to carry you through the in-game, but if you have someone  to trade with, you can easily upgrade to Roopushin early on, whose 140  base attack literally smashes all the competition flat.</p>

<h3>Otamaru</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_otamarusprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you picked Pokabu you'll find great interest in this  extremely early-game water type. Otamaru may not look intimidating, but  even at its initial capture and early levels it is packing extremely  useful and powerful moves (relatively speaking) like BubbleBeam, Sing a  Round (giving you Water/Normal coverage), and Mud Shot. Even without HM  support, it learns the powerful Muddy Water at level 28 (after evolving  at level 25). "Compatible with Grass Knot and Dig, two great early-game  TMs" is probably something you will hear many times in this  article&mdash;but there it is. Two great in-game moves for Otamaru  to abuse, especially after becoming a Water/Ground-type upon evolution. A  final evolution at level 36 is somewhat undesirable, but it is  workable. It might not be a stand out in any area, but its decent  defensive and offensive stats will be dependable throughout the game.  "Probably outclassed by Swampert" would be its OU prospects, but this  gen's mudfish (becomes a toad?) will not disappoint in-game.</p>

<h3>Shimama</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_shimamasprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Where would this generation be without our little Electric  Zebra? While it is unlikely that Zeburaika will be beating out Jolteon  for people's favorite fast, electricity-absorbing Electric-type sweeper,  in-game Shimama's line is simply fantastic. Shimama makes its first  appearance on Route 3, appearing extremely early in the game. Terrific  offensive base stats and two fantastic offensive abilities make it a  prime choice. Lightingrod and Motor Drive both absorb electric attacks,  Lightningrod boosting your Special Attack and Motor Drive boosting your  Speed. Shock Wave and Nitro Charge appear early, giving you excellent  power and coverage for the early game, not to mention free Speed boosts.  Nitro Charge comes in extremely useful in beating many early game Bug-  and Grass- types, especially for those players who are using  Tsutaja/Hiyappu. It will also be your go-to Pokémon against the many  different Flying-types you will face in-game.</p>

<p>I should also note that Shimama/Zeburaika (after its early  level 27 evolution) are also very useful for the Electric-type gym. Many  Ground-type Pokémon have trouble with Emonga, who is immune to their  Ground attacks and can paralyze them with Static should they use contact  moves. Zeburaika pretty much shuts the flying squirrel down without  lifting a finger. Without its Electric-type attacks, Emonga has no  attack more powerful than an un-stabbed un-boosted base 40 Pursuit or  Quick Attack. Otherwise, it will likely spam Double  Team&mdash;useless in the face of Shock Wave, which hits without  fail, does not touch (so no Static activation), and hits the  Flying/Electric rat hard for neutral damage. Upon defeating the Electric  Gym, it gets immediate access to Volt Change&mdash; a special  Electric-type U-turn sure to make waves on the competitive scene and  make for fun plays in-game as well! Discharge and Wild Bolt follow  shortly! Zeburaika is definitely a strong support for any in-game  team.</p>

<h3>Meguroko</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_megurokosprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Meguroko is markedly a Pokemon with unique in-game uses in  Pokemon Black and White Versions. It can be caught in an early stage of  the story, lurking in the tall grasses of Route 4 and catchable at  levels 15-18. It makes a great addition to any in-game team. If you wish  to catch the crocodile a bit later in the game, you can try the Ancient  Castle, which comes almost immediately after Route 4 and offers  Meguroko up to level 21. The Desert Crocodile Pokemon learns a variety  of useful attacks both via level-up and TM, including decent forms of  STAB at early levels, namely Assurance/Bite and Dig (TM obtainable very  early in the game). It is notable that Dark/Ground is a great stab combo  in competitive pokemon as well. As it levels up and evolves, it starts  learning more powerful attacks including Crunch, Earthquake, and even  Outrage (Warubiaru learns it at level 60). Movepool aside, Meguroku gets  terrific abilities. Intimidate not only provides a buffer for  Meguroku's average bulk, but also provides utility for its teammates in  the form of easier switch-ins. The second ability, Overconfidence, can  be very useful when facing an opponent with multiple Pokemon, as it will  steadily raise Meguroko's Attack as it faints enemies. Meguroko and its  evolutions' decent stat distribution, typing, and nice movepool allows  it to be of decent use when facing the gyms that follow its capture,  including the Raimon Gym specializing in Electric-type  Pokemon&mdash;a potential roadblock for Mijimaru users.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_darumakka.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<h3>Darumakka</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_darumakkasprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Darumakka is also available on Route 4 and in the Resort  desert, weighing in its early 20s for level. At the point you catch it,  it will already have decent attacking options like Fire Fang and  Headbutt, and will almost immediately learn Fire Punch. It also is  compatible with some great early game TMs like Grass Knot and Dig, which  give it good coverage (admittedly, Grass Knot does piddling damage  coming from Darumakka's worse-than-caterpie SpA stat) with Fire and  Normal. At level 27 it gets the now 120 Base Power Thrash, and at level  33 gets its hands on the ever-desired Flare Blitz, that premium move of  physical Fire. Removing their chance for burn, Encourage makes all its  Fire-type attacks obscenely strong (Fire Punch goes up to 168.75, and  Flare Blitz becomes significantly more powerful than a STAB Draco  Meteor). After it evolves (gaining 140 base attack) and picks up  Superpower, it will become a true juggernaut of the team, crushing all  who oppose. One mush be wary of its average defenses and speed, but  appreciate the raw power it will bring to the party. Bang!</p>

<h3>Shinboraa</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_shinboraasprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Even battling these in-game will give many players trouble. For  a fully-evolved Pokemon, Shinboraa is caught relatively early in the  game at the desert Resort. It already has Psybeam, powerful enough to  carry it through most of the game with STAB and 103 Special Attack. For  in-game, it is fast, strong, tough (and can be tougher while supporting  its teammates with screens), and comes ready to go out of the box. Of  force it picks up the powerful and useful Fly HM, becoming your personal  chauffeur across the whole region. Give this flying Totem Pole a shot  and you will not be disappointed.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_bachuru.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<h3>Bachuru</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_bachurusprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you make your way into Electric Rock cave after defeating  Yakon, you're sure to come across a Bachuru. While at first glance, the  electric spider may seem to be rather weak, it's in fact perfectly  suited to the upcoming Flying-type gym and the rest of the game. Its  chief benefits come from CompoundEyes&mdash;giving it a perfectly  accurate Thunder&mdash;, a useful typing&mdash;it is not weak to  any of the upcoming gyms or the Elite Four&mdash;, and its wide  movepool, which lends it the ability to pull off multiple roles, and can  earn it a place on any team. When you first get Bachuru, you will be a  fair way through the game, heading towards the sixth gym after defeating  Yakon and his Ground-type Pokémon. At this point, you'll be able to  equip your Bachuru with several key moves you should have found earlier  in the game. The first of these is Volt Change, the prize for defeating  Kamitsure, the Electric gym leader. This move has two roles for Bachuru;  it compensates for its frailty and gives it a reasonably strong special  Electric-type move to use against the upcoming Flying-type gym in  Fukiyose City. The next town after that will sell you Thunder, allowing  you to use that for STAB and Volt Change for safety. The next trick up  Bachuru's sleeve is Signal Beam. Learnt at level 34 (just before it  evolves into the even more dangerous Denchura), it provides our spider  with a great special STAB to tide it over until it finally learns Bug  Buzz at level 60, and will stand it in good stead when you finally reach  the Elite Four (two members of which have teams which are weak to  Bug-type moves). I would say that these two moves are almost essential  on Bachuru; both of them give it the tools to fight in almost any of the  battles until you beat the Elite Four without worrying about facing  Pokémon that resist both of them.</p>

<p>However, we're able to improvise a bit in the last two move  slots, depending on what you want your spider to do. If you want your  spider to be an annoyer, handing out status before tagging out to a  sweeper, then your first move should be either Thunder Wave or Toxic  (with CompoundEyes, both of these moves have 100% accuracy). If you  really want to make sure you can cripple your opponent, you can run  both&mdash;but personally, I'd rather run one of these (in my  opinion, Toxic will stand you in good stead) and either Thunder or Light  Screen, letting you set up or switch out to a more powerful Pokémon to  sweep with. Alternatively, if you want to go all-out offensive, you can  run Thunder for your first slot, and either run Poison Jab, Sing a  Round, or Charge Beam (if you don't mind the risk of having three  electric moves on a single Pokémon. All three of these can be viable;  indeed, if you don't plan on switching out, you can replace Volt Change  with any one of them to give you even more power. However, it's worth  bearing in mind that for all its power, Bachuru and Denchura are still  very flimsy, and having a "get out of jail free card" is massively  useful to them.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. Using Bachuru can give you a huge  advantage in the second half of the game, due to its speed, strength,  and perhaps above all its typing. Don't miss out on the unique  opportunities that it presents. Give it a try; I can guarantee you won't  regret it!</p>

<h3>Shikijika</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_shikijikasprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Arguably the best Grass-type pokemon in-game. On one hand, its  special attack stat is... the same as Luvdisc's... and it does not get a  physical Grass attack until it evolves and reaches level 37. On the  other hand, it is the only Grass-type in-game to have good coverage.  Thanks to STAB Take Down (or Vengeance to avoid recoil) and Fighting  moves in Double-Kick and Jump Kick, it will almost never be floundering  for a usable offensive move. While it does not get too many Grass-type  attacks, there's always Grass Knot, after all. Speaking of TMs, it also  gets Cheer Up, letting it boost its Attack to frightening levels and  somewhat rescue its poor Special Attack. Even if you do depend on Grass  Knot, it is not a big issue in-game, and STAB Grass/STAB Normal/Fighting  coverage is a blessing that Jaroda would die to have (and is a  non-issue as soon as you get your hand on Wood Horn). You can catch this  cute little deer at reasonable levels on Routes 6 and 7, and can even  find its evolution at the Dragon Spiral Tower.</p>

<h3>Kurimugan</h3>

<p><img src="/media/smog/12/ingame_kurimugansprite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have talked quite a bit about Pokémon that are found early,  but an in-game team also wants to consider Pokémon that appear late at  high levels&mdash;such that one can progress through the game  without trying to inefficiently raise 6 Pokémon at once. The idea is to  raise 4-5 and pick up the last members near the end. Kurimugan is  excellent in this latter role. It appears at level 30-33 at Dragon  Spiral Tower, outside Sekka City (where you need to go anyway to clean  up Team Plasma). While not common, they are certainly not rare. Also of  note, with Crunch and Dragon Claw (which it already has upon capture),  Kurimugan is capable of hitting almost all of Dragon Spiral Tower's  inhabitants for super effective damage, making raising it on its own  stomping grounds quite easy.</p>

<p>Only 2 levels after its capture it learns Revenge (at level  35), giving it near-flawless Dragon/Fighting coverage. It is also  compatible with the Dig TM, giving it another potential coverage option  should you not like Revenge. With 77 / 90 / 90 base defenses, it is  quite bulky and can make good use of Revenge. With 120 base Atack, it can  rip the enemies to shreds. While being a slow Dragon-type may be a real  weakness in competitive play, in-game it means little with few enemies  using Dragon and Ice attacks (though keep in mind the last Gym is the  Dragon-type Gym, meaning Kurimugan will either clean up or be cleaned  up). Great base stats, a great movepool, and resistances to Fire, Water,  Grass and Electric make it a fantastic in-game choice.</p>
