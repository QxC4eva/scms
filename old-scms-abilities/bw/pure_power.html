Doubles Attack stat.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pure Power doubles the wielder's Attack stat.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Obviously an amazing ability, but only one Pokemon has it. Even though <a href="/bw/pokemon/medicham">Medicham</a>'s base Attack is only 60 to begin with, Pure Power raises it to barely behind <a href="/bw/pokemon/deoxys-a">Deoxys-A</a>, meaning Medicham should not be taken lightly at all. It also has a ridiculous STAB move to use in <a href="/bw/moves/hi_jump_kick">Hi Jump Kick</a>. Medicham is frail though, and without an effective priority move cannot function effectively in the higher tiers, though its power is potent in the lower tiers.</p>
