Moves
=====
Psychic is a powerful STAB moves that hits the common fighting types as well as poisons, such as Foongus.
Shadow Ball hits ghosts who threaten Abra with their STAB.

Dazzling Gleam provides coverage against Dark types, however Hidden Power Fighting is useful if your team is scared by Pawniard and Houndour, who are neutral to Fairy type attacks.

Protect is the better option for the Sash set, as it protects Abra from Fake Out; which is necessary to keep Abra's focus sash active. Substitute is better on the Life Orb set, where it gives Abra a bit of a defense, since it naturally forces a lot of switches. It also allows Abra to get around Sucker Punchers.
Set Details
========
This set it designed to hit very hard, very fast, while utilizing Abra's great coverage to KO and revenge kill a multitude of pokemon.

With Max investment and a positive nature, Abra hits the glorious 19 speed, enough to tie with threats such as Misdreavus and Murkrow. 

The Life Orb set can 2KO most pokemon that the sash set cannot. Also, thanks to Magic Guard, Abra takes no damage from the item's recoil. The purpose of the Life Orb set is to hit hard and escape fast. 

The Focus Sash is quite weaker, however it should be used to abuse Abra's great speed to revenge kill set-up sweepers who would otherwise plow through the rest of the team. The Focus Sash ensures that Abra cannot be OHKO'd since it is immune to anything other than direct damage.
Usage Tips
========
Since Abra cannot take hits easily, Protect is useful on both sets. For LO, it allows Abra to check for nasty scarfers and Fake Out, especially from Meditite. 

The Focus Sash set is used as a fail-safe against set up sweepers, since they cannot directly OHKO it.
Team Options
==========
Abra works well on teams who, like bulky teams, need a powerful and fast attacker. 
Offensive teams also appreciate Abra, who can break through walls with Magic Guard, and high powered attacks.

Abra appreciates pokemon who can handle Dark types. Fighting types in particular resist that type and can also threaten special walls like Munchlax and Porygon. Fairy types also work well.

Slow U-turns or Volt Switches, like Nosepass, can get Abra in safely. U-turn, a bug type move, also keeps dark types away.
Other Options
==========
Substitute can be useful on Abra, considering how it lures in Sucker Punch users. However it is unreliable and Abra is too frail to set it up in any other situation.

Abra gets Charge Beam to do damage and boost its special, but Abra is so frail that its generally not worth it. This is also the case with Calm Mind

Abra can set up Dual Screen, and has encore to ensure it sets up unscaved. Thankfully, it is very fast and can encore before a mon has the chance to attack.

Psyshock can be used if Munchlax is a problem, however Little Cup is a very physically defensive metagame, and Psyshock misses a guaranteed OHKO on some important pokemon, such as Timburr, if Abra is not running Life Orb.

A scarf set with Trick could be interesting, and is useful for revenge killing fast threats like Dragon Dance Scraggy and other scarfers.
Checks & Counters
==============
Due to Focus Sash and Magic Guard, Abra cannot be KOed. However there are some pokemon who can survive a hit and remove it of the sash, allowing it to be revenged by priority or scarfed mons. 

Pawniard, Houndour, and Stunky give Abra a headache if its not running Hidden Power Fighting. They can easily get the KO with their STAB moves, especially Sucker Punch.

Munchlax is a huge counter to Abra, taking little from all its moves (even Hidden Power fighting) and being able to trap it with Pursuit.

Misdreavus can survive a Shadow Ball and KO, and sometimes outspeeds due to a nasty speed tie.

Carvanha can stall with Protect until its able to outspeed and KO Abra with its STAB

Abra greatly relies on its speed, so it hates to be paralyzed. Slowpoke can survive a Shadow Ball and hinder it with Thunder Wave, while healing its health back with Regenerator.

Priority is Abra's greatest nightmare, being able to nullify its great speed and deal a lot of damage because of it's low defenses. Fortunately, however, it resists Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave.
Magic Guard doesn't prevent Sticky Web, meaning Abra can easily be revenged killed.
Many scarf pokemon, Chinchou in particular, can revenge kill Abra easily.
