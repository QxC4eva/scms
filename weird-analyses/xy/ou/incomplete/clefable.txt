Overview
########

Generation after generation, Clefable has languished in the shadows of its many contemporaries, but no more is this the case, as Clefable's astronomical rise to OU super-stardom is attributed to its brand-spanking, new Fairy typing. Two phenomenal abilities in Magic Guard and Unaware allow it to take on a multitude of roles including a Calm Mind sweeper, physical and special wall, and even a tank. With Unaware, Clefable is able to effortlessly halt a significant quantity of boosting sweepers and even use such sweepers as setup bait, whereas Magic Guard works fantastically in negating every form of residual damage, making it an incredibly dangerous Pokemon for stall-based teams and quite tricky to wear down. That's not all—with a movepool that quite literally stretches out to the end of the cosmos, Clefable is able to execute these many sets with extraordinary proficiency and versatility. Furthermore, Clefable's amazing movepool—both supportively and offensively—along with its outstanding abilities makes it the perfect glue 'mon to many teams, easily stitching the holes in teams that struggle with top-tier threats such as Manaphy, Thundurus, and the various Fighting- and Dragon-types inhabiting the OU tier. Another advantage to Clefable's versatility is how arduous it is to even counter, as with the correct move, it can cripple or even KO just about any Pokemon in the game. In stark contrast to how vast Clefable's movepool is, its stats pale in comparison. With not a single base stat toppling over 100, it is quite apparent that Clefable must specialize in two stats—at most—in order to achieve the highest success rate for any of its sets. While Clefable's typing is unquestionably good, its mediocre defenses can only take it so far. This flaws becomes moreso evident when Clefable is compared to bulkier Fairy-types such as Togekiss, which unlike Clefable, has the raw bulk to take on a few Choice-users that Clefable struggles against, such as Keldeo. In conclusion, Clefable's claim to fame is this: at any moment of the battle, Clefable's sheer unpredictability gives its user a distinct advantage over their opponent; the ability to completely change the tide of the match with a surprise move is invaluable, especially with Clefable, as the amount of tricks it can pull out of its hat is as endless as the universe itself.

Set Details
========

    12 Speed EVs outspeed minimum speed Tyranitar
    Calm Mind patches up Clefable's mediocre special stats, allowing it fully invest in its physical defense so that it can check physical fighting- and dragon-types
    The defense evs are useful so that clefable isn't taken for a whirl against powerful psyshock users such as latios
    it also works to effectively counter the likes of belly drum azumarill and dragon dance gyarados with unaware

Usage Tips
========

This set is meant to fill two simultaneous roles: the first of which is that Clefable acts as a fantastic check to a multitude of set up sweepers courtesy of Unaware, while acting as a solid late-game win condition with Calm Mind. This Clefable should be played as a defensive Pokemon at the start of the match and only go for a Calm Mind sweep late- to mid-game, as that point, that's when its many checks and counters are properly weakened. On the other hand, with its solid defenses, it can counter or check following set up sweepers at the earlier stages of the match: Swords Dance Talonflame, Belly Drum Azumarill, Calm Mind Reuniclus, Tail Glow Manaphy, Swords Dance Garchomp, Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Nasty Plot Thundurus, and many more. It's also key to note that this Clefable will always come out on top against opposing Calm Mind users, so there's little to fear when up against such threats, and in fact, it's in Clefable's best interest to set up against those types of Pokemon. While it's better to save Calm Mind for when Clefable can sweep, the move can useful in that it plumps up Clefable's Special Defense, allowing it to better deal with more powerful offensive threats such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Life Orb Volcarona.

Stall- and bulky offense-based teams is where this Clefable thrives. It's key to not reveal Calm Mind until the later stages of the match; in other words, fool your opponent into thinking that it's merely a defensive set, as in that case, they're likely to play carefully with their Clefable check(s) due to the fact that it might not posse an offensive threat. Something to keep in mind is that it's best not to mindlessly switch Clefable into Trick users, even those that it normally counters. Likewise, when up against these threats one-on-one, it's good to scout their move with Protect should they choose to stay in. Protect is also good to use to ease pivot switching, accumulate Leftovers recovery, and in general, play mind games with your opponent. Unlike other Pokemon that rely on Protect, Clefable does not have to fear most set up sweepers, as the only thing to watch out for when using the move is giving your opponent a free chance to set up entry hazards.

Team Options
========

    It generally appreciates support from Pokemon that can smash through the likes of Mega Venusaur, so powerful psychic-types such as Latias can deal with these threats with ease
    In return, clefable can help deal with opposing dark- and dragon-types that trouble it
    Other offensive partners that can work are Alakazam and Tornadus-t for similar reasons to the above
    More applicable defensive partners are chansey and blissey as they can function as reliable special walls while clefable takes on more physical oriented threats
    Skarmory is one of the better physical walls to pair it with, as it can check pesky steel-types rather well
    Hippowdon can also be an effective partner for the above reason
    Magnezone is also a preferred partner to take out the likes of of bisharp, mega mawile, and various other steel-types

    This clefable can be brought in and wall mega garchomp, physical mega lucario, dragon dance gyarados, dragonite, mega medicham, swords dance talonflame, and many more
    unaware is best used to check the above threats, as it prevents their boosts from leaving a mark
    magic guard should be used to take down the likes of latios and latias, both of which haven no chance to take clefable down due to how impervious it is to residual damage
    when utilizing magic guard this clefable can also be an effective stop to many stallbreakers such as sableye

Team Options

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Wish
move 2: Protect
move 3: Moonblast
move 4: Aromatherapy / Toxic
ability: Unaware
item: Leftovers
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 Spe

Moves
========

    Pretty Self-explanatory
    Wish + Protect to work as reliable recovery
    It also allows it to act as a Wish passer
    Moonblast is Clefable's most reliable STAB
    Aromatherapy lets it act as a cleric and somewhat makes up for the lack of Magic Guard
    If cleric support isn't needed, then clefable can act as a reliable entry hazard setter for its team
    Toxic is also another option in the fourth slot, it can be used in tandem with protect + wish to stall out the opponents

Set Details
========

    Special investment is used to counter / check special-boosting sweepers such as Manaphy, the Thundurus formes, Lati@s, Goodra lacking a poison move, other specially based Dragon-types, Nasty Plot Togekiss, Life Orb-less Volcarona, Keldeo, Genesect without a steel move, and certain Tornadus-T
    Magic Guard can also work so that clefable becomes impervious to status and residual damage; however, unaware is key to clefable's success if it wants to stop special boosting sweepers
    clefable can also run stealth rock if its needed

Usage Tips
========

    This set has many applications: it functions as a cleric/toxic staller, wish passer, special wall, and sometimes a stop to certain physical attackers
    This set best thrives in stall / balanced teams as it can pass wishes to teammates that lack recovery and cure them of status ailments
    The ability to wish pass makes it all the more useful for clefable's partners to help support it; for instance, when clefable uses wish the very turn a steel-type check such as aegislash shows up, then the wish makes it easier for a partner such as Landorus-T to come in and tank the hit
    On top of being able to effectively check/counter most specially based set up sweepers, this clefable can also check certain physical attackers such as Dragonite, Garchomp, Lucario lacking a steel move, and Zygarde
    Do note that this Clefable shouldn't be brought in directly on these types of Pokemon, as the lack of physical investment can make it difficult; rather, it's better to utilize it as a soft check against these sort of threats

Team Options
========

    It appreciates Pokemon that can deal with Poison-types and Steel-types in general
    Excadrill is fantastic at doing so and provides Stealth Rock Support
    Skarmory also works rather well and phase and set up other entry hazards
    Forms a superb defensive core with Mega Aggron, as it can give it Aromatherapy and Wish support, while Mega Aggron can easily take on the likes Mega Mawile and Bisharp
    Heatran also works as an effective partner; the two can together check many specially based attackers. Heatran benefits clefable serving as a good check to most steel- and poison-types as well as being able to set up stealth rock. Clefable aids heatran by passing it wishes and dealing with pesky special water-types that scare heatran out.
    Landorus-T also works as an effective partner for similar reasons to the above

Tank
########
name: Tank
move 1: Moonblast
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Soft-Boiled
ability: Magic Guard
item: Life Orb
nature: Modest
evs: 244 HP / 252 SpA / 12 Spe

Moves
========

    Backed by a Life Orb, Moonblast hits ridiculously hard and is the easiest move to spam
    Fire Blast deals with Steel-types that can easily take Clefable's fairy-type STABs
    Thunderbolt rounds out the coverage by hitting the likes of Heatran for neutral damage as well as maiming the likes of Talonflame and Tentacruel
    Soft-Boiled increases Clefable's longevity and can make it quite the nuisance to pick off, especially for more defensive teams

Set Details
========

    Speed EVs allow it to outspeed 0 speed tyraintar
    Magic Guard is chosen for this set to make the most out of Life Orb
    Psychic or Psyshock can be used to break past the likes of mega venusaur

Usage Tips
========

    the primary application of this set is to switch clefable into something it can force out (i.e. Rotom-W) then smack the preceding switch-in with a life orb boosted special move
    when combined with entry hazards, this set works incredibly well at wearing down the opposing team
    This sets fits on bulky offense teams in need of something that can act as a reliable dragon- and fighting-type sponge as well
    Juxtaposition of bulk, power, longevity, and coverage can prove to be disruptive for many defensive and bulky offensive cores alike; any team that has difficulty with such things with this clefable's inclusion

Team Options
========

    generally appreciates entry hazard support, in particular it can OHKO bulky talonflame with T-bolt after stealth rock
    other than that, it's fairly self-sufficient; it benefits its teammates more than they benefit it
    for instance, genesect will appreciate clefable's core smashing capabilities so that it can have an easier time mowing down the team
    Pokemon such as Landorus-t and Garchomp also appreciate clefable's capability to smash through most physical walls

Other Options
########

The most stand-out option excluded from the analysis is a Cosmic Power set. Cosmic Power Clefable becomes incredibly difficult to take down just after a few boosts. Furthermore, Clefable can take advantage of these plentiful stat boosts via Stored Power. The Cosmic Power set can also utilize either Magic Guard or Unaware alongside Moonblast and/or Stored Power with a selection of the following moves: Soft-Boiled + Flamethrower for Magic Guard variants; Wish + Protect or Moonlight + Flamethrower for Unaware variants. While the Cosmic Power set has many different approaches, the issue with it is that there will always be a gaping flaw that prevents such a set from working too consistently. If Clefable does not use Magic Guard, it will find itself utterly ruined by Toxic, and if Clefable forgoes Unaware, the set becomes far too passive, so much so that other boosting sweepers can set up alongside it. Indeed, the Cosmic Power set has the potential to win games, but its hit-or-miss type of performance ultimately prevents it from being included within the other standard sets.

Clefable has a slew of other supportive and disruptive tactics including Encore, Healing Wish, Thunder Wave, Trick + Flame Orb, Magic Coat, and Counter. Encore can work effectively with Magic Guard variants by halting boosting sweepers; Encore can also be useful to lock slower entry hazard setters into one move; however, Clefable should best stick to Unaware if it wants to combat boosting sweepers, and outside of the previously mentioned applications, Encore has otherwise limited use. Healing Wish can be game-changing move on more offensively based teams by restoring the health of an injured sweeper, although sacrificing Clefable is generally imprudent given its vital role as a team player. Speaking of support, Clefable can easily spread paralysis thanks to its solid bulk, but it is key to note that most Pokemon that switch into Clefable are rather slow or simply unfazed by paralysis. Trick + Flame Orb in tandem with Magic Guard is a great way to cripple many of Clefable's common switch-ins such as Bisharp, Excadrill, and Scizor among others. Another way Clefable can becomes even more of annoyance is with Magic Coat, as it can deflect entry hazards from the Deoxys formes and give faster Taunt users a taste of their own medicine. Counter can also find use by getting a surprise KO on physical attackers that want to try their luck with Clefable, but this option is an immediate giveaway and subsequent waste if used carelessly.

In regards to more offensive options, Clefable has no shortage of offensive moves that include Focus Blast, Hidden Power Ground, Charge Beam, Ice Beam, Seismic Toss, Knock Off, and other physical moves. Focus Blast can be used over Flamethrower on the Calm Mind sets to break past Heatran, but its low PP and unappealing accuracy might be a turnoff. Likewise, Hidden Power Ground is another way to eradicate Heatran, but it's rather weak against every other Steel-type, even after boost. Charge Beam may also be used to simultaneously attack and potentially bestow Clefable with a Special Attack boost, but just like Hidden Power Ground, it is laughably weak. Seismic Toss can be used on the defensive sets for a consistent damaging move. Knock Off's disruptive shenanigans can work well in crippling many of Clefable's opponents, but again, it is quite weak. Lastly, Clefable has a fairly large physical movepool including Double-Edge, Drain Punch, the elemental punches, and even access to Belly Drum, but such options are far too gimmicky for standard use and to make matters worse, Clefable does not have a decent, physical Fairy-type STAB.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Taunt users**: The best way to beat Clefable is through the use of faster and bulky Taunt users. Mew and Deoxys-D can easily come in on just about every one of Clefable's attacks, prevent it from boosting or recovering via Taunt, and wear it down with repeated attacks. The only thing that stops Mew or Deoxys-D is an incoming Toxic on the switch.

**Steel-types**: Just about every Steel-type can check Clefable fairly well by virtue of their ability to outright OHKO it with their STABs. These Pokemon include Aegislash, Bisharp, Mega Mawile, Mega Aggron, Jirachi, Scizor, Excadrill, and Heatran. Although it is precautionary that these all of the Pokemon (with the exception of Heatran) avoid directly switching in on Clefable, as it frequently carries a Fire-type move that can eradicate them, and in the case of Heatran, it can simply be overpowered by Calm Mind variants one-on-one or be worn down by repeated Thunderbolts.

**Poison-types**: One of the more notable checks to Clefable is Mega Venusaur, as it can switch into all of Clefable's standard attacks and 2HKO with Sludge Bomb; however, similar to Heatran, Clefable can muscle through it with the Calm Mind set. Other effective Poison-types are Amoonguss, Gengar, Roserade, and Tentacruel. Amoonguss only has to watch out for a Life Orb-boosted Fire Blast, otherwise it's a solid check to Clefable for similar reasons to Venusaur, but in contrast, it does not lose to the Calm Mind sets because of its access to Clear smog. In the case of Gengar and Roserade, neither of them enjoy switching in on a Fire-type move, but should they get in safely, they can easily destroy Clefable with Sludge Bomb. In contrast to the previous two, Tentacruel can switch into most of Clefable's attacks and overwhelm it with repeated Sludge Bombs, though it does have to watch out for Thunderbolt. So long as it steers clear of Thunderbolt, Crobat can easily beat Clefable one-versus-one with Taunt + Roost.
