Reduces damage from super effective hits by 25%.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Whenever a super effective move is used on the wielder, the damage is decreased by 25%. Basically, 2x effective attacks are treated as though they were 1.5x effective, and 4x effective attacks as if they were 3x effective.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Another fantastic ability that is wasted due to poor distribution. <a href="/bw/pokemon/rhyperior">Rhyperior</a> could be a dangerous threat if the current OU metagame wasn't infested with Water-type moves. <a href="/bw/pokemon/camerupt">Camerupt</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/carracosta">Carracosta</a> both really are plainly not very good for one reason or another, so Solid Rock doesn't see much use, but is a great ability regardless.</p>
