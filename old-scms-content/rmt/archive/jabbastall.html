<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I love this team to death, however it hasn't been working that well lately! It still absolutely decimates balanced teams and usually other stall teams. However azelf lead glass cannon teams absolutely rape me and I don't like consistently losing to one type of team with absolutely no hope of winning. So just like with jabbahail I'm left with 2 options, update it or retire it. So once again I turn to you trusty team raters to help me fix this bad boy and help it get with the times!</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Poison Point<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Toxic Spikes<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>

<p>I stole this set from husk and it proved to be quite amazing. Luke counter and t-spiker. Sometimes I consider packing Ice Beam > Sleep Talk and adding Heal Bell on Celebi in order to nail the Dragons that often think they can switch in for free. Definitely only works well as a lead if my opp leads with zong. I mean sometimes it can be annoying having your luke counter put to sleep but the free layer is sometimes worth it!</p>

<p><strong>Blissey</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 252 Def / 56 SpA / 202 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Softboiled</p>

<p>SR Bliss. Used to use Wishbliss until Colin banned Wish so I shifted SR over from Celebi and it definitely works better. Whenever Blissey comes in it's usually to the tune of a free turn so SR is usually set up fairly easily. My spread is shit, I know. I've been meaning to shift those spdef ev's into hp, i need the ability to take physical hits with Blissey a lot more than i need those sp. def ev's.</p>

<p><strong>Starmie</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 252 Def / 40 SpA / 216 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Surf<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Recover<br />
- Ice Beam</p>

<p>I've run this set/spread since i ripped it from ET about over a year ago (I only recently changed tbolt > ice beam after I realized that the dragons gave me more trouble than Gyarados). Every good stall team needs a spinner and Starmie is the only one I really like so it was quite the obvious choice!</p>

<p><strong>Skarmory</strong> @ Shed Shell<br />
Ability: Keen Eye<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Drill Peck<br />
- Whirlwind<br />
- Roost<br />
- Spikes</p>

<p>My spike setter-upper. Shed Shell because I'd rather not be almost guaranteed to lose if my opponent has Magnezone. Actually with Shed Shell, if your opp has Magnezone it usually means you get 1 layer of spikes and then your free SR which is always pretty awesome. Also as you can see this is the only real Weavile/Mamoswine counter I have and it can be 2hkoed by both (weavile after the sd) so that's probably something I need to work on.</p>

<p><strong>Celebi</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 110 Def / 112 SpD / 36 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Leech Seed<br />
- Recover<br />
- Grass Knot<br />
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>I personally think every stall team needs Leech Seed. It prevents bulky stalk set uppers from ruining your day, mainly last pokemon Crocune/Curselax for me. I packed some sp. def in there so I can better take Ice Beams from bulky waters and HP Ice from Zapdos and it also comes in handy against D-S who kind of hits my entire team for SE X_x (still usually isn't a problem though). HP Fire because in early stages I realized Forretress could be a giant asshole.</p>

<p><strong>Zapdos</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 224 SpD / 32 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Roar<br />
- Roost<br />
- Substitute</p>

<p>A weird spinoff creation that I came up with based on gorm's (i think he stole it from someone first though but i forget!) subroost Zapdos. This thing has singlehandedly won me games/annoyed my opponent so much they left. Also is my only Abomasnow "counter" (if subbing out blizzards can be called countering!). However Zapdos is consistently the most useless against glass cannon teams which means I can replace it if need be.</p>
