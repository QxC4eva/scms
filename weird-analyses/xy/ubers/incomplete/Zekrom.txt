Overview
########

Bursting out of Unova's lightning clouds, Zekrom enters the X/Y metagame to assist those who want to build an ideal world, a world inhabitable for the legendary birds of Ubers. With its physical STAB moves and a sky-high attack stat to back them up, Zekrom is able to serve as a check to many of Ubers' biggest threats when equipped with a Choice Scarf, including but not limited to Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Lugia, Kyogre and Mewtwo. Unlike most dragons in the tier, the advent of Fairy-types was not as bad for Zekrom, as neither of them enjoy taking its STAB Bolt Strike on the switch. Zekrom can also run mixed sets very well, able to lure in some of its usual checks and smack them with special attacks. Futhermore, it has some utility moves like Volt Switch, Dragon Tail, Substitute and Tailwind in its movepool to take advantage of the many switches it forces. Being immune to paralysis only further enhances its ability to clean up weakened teams late game. The slower nature of the X/Y metagame also gives Zekrom many more opportunities to come in and do its job. That being said, Zekrom does have its downfalls: Base 90 speed is still amongst the slowest Pokemon in Ubers and Zekrom will often have to rely on a Choice Scarf to patch up its speed. Being choice-locked into either of its STABs can be a huge disadvantage, since there are immunities to both of them now in Ground and Fairy. For a physically-oriented dragon it's also a shame Zekrom doesn't get Dragon Dance and its only boosting move is the mediocre Hone Claws. These downfalls, however, do not prevent Zekrom from being the anti-metagame Pokemon it is. Play it to its strenghs, and it will definitely help you shape your ideal world.


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Volt Switch / Dragon Claw
move 4: Dragon Claw / Draco Meteor / Sleep Talk
ability: Teravolt
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Naughty / Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Bolt Strike is Zekrom's Electric-type STAB of choice as it hits everything in the tier that doesn't resist it for massive amounts of damage. With Bolt Strike, Zekrom is able to revenge kill popular threats such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Kyogre, Lugia and Mewtwo. It will also do massive amounts of damage to anything that is neutral to it, almost achieving a 2HKO on max. HP Arceus, while actually achieving the 2HKO with Stealth Rocks up. Outrage gives Zekrom neutral coverage on any Pokemon in the metagame bar Ferrothorn while packing almost as much power. The last two slots are not used to gain additional coverage but rather to gain utility that Bolt Strike and Outrage lack. Volt Switch allows you to keep momentum by taking advantage of the many switches Zekrom forces. Dragon Claw is a decently powerful STAB option Zekrom can use early game when it's too early to lock yourself into Outrage, especially when you don't know the opponent's Arceus forme. Draco Meteor in conjuction with the listed EVs allows you to take advantage of Groudon's lower special defense while dealing the same amount of damage as Dragon Claw. to Arceus. Draco Meteor, however, comes with the nasty downside that it makes you complete Mega Gengar fodder after it halved your special attack. If you don't need an additional Dragon-type STAB, Sleep Talk allows Zekrom to serve as your team's sleep absorber and Darkrai check. It must be noted, though, that a Zekrom using Sleep Talk will be a pretty shaky check to the Pokemon it's supposed to check normally.


Set Details
========

Maximum investment in Attack and Speed alongside an attack boosting nature are preferred as this allows Zekrom to outspeed everything up to Mega Mewtwo Y. Keep in mind that without a speed boosting nature Zekrom will not outspeed maximum speed Deoxys-A. If your team lacks priority to take Deoxys down, a Naive nature can be used as well. However, Naive Zekrom will miss out on the 2HKO on Max HP Arceus which can be important as well. A nature that decreases Zekroms special defense is preferred since every priority attack commonly used in Ubers is physical. If you run neither Volt Switch nor Draco Meteor, and Adamant or Jolly nature is perfectly fine.

Usage Tips
========

    Really, just click the appropriate move and watch things get decimated
    Prediction is VERY important because of all the immunities around
    That said, once your opponent sees what you've locked yourself into, it's easy to play around Zekrom


Team Options
========

    Kyogre can handle Groudon and Groundceus well. Kyogre and Zekrom can also take many hits aimed at the other
    hazard support is nice - ferrothorn, skarmory and forretress can take dragon and fairy type attacks aimed at Zekrom
    Mega Gengar works well as it is able to trap and kill fairies - before megaevolving, gengar is also immune to ground type attacks, acting as a one time switch in allowing it to evolve




Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Draco Meteor
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Dragon Claw / Volt Switch
ability: Teravolt
item: Life Orb
nature: Lonely / Naughty
evs: 104 HP / 148 Atk / 252 SpA / 4 Spe

Moves
========

    Bolt Strike has nice coverage in ubers, OHKOing popular threats such as Ho-Oh, Lugia, Kyogre and Yveltal while also hitting the two new fairies, Xerneas and Arceus for good damage (will provide calcs)
    Draco Meteor provides nice coverage alongside BS and hits Physical walls such as Groudon hard (54.4 - 64.1% to 252 HP / 0 SpDef)
    Focus Blast is Zekrom's best option against the rare Ferrothorn. If Ferro isn't a concern to your team otherwise, Crunch is a solid option to hit the Psychic types in Ubers as well as Giratina hard after a SpA drop from DM
    The final slot gives Zekrom a solid physical STAB option in Dragon Claw, allowing to hit many ubers on their weaker defense stat. Since Zekrom hits most of its switch-ins hard with BS or DM anyway, Volt Switch allows you to gain momentum on predicted switches.


Set Details
========

    Lonely is the preferred nature. since most Ubers are specially based you want to keep at least some special bulk. most physical attackers are faster anyway and have an SE coverage move (EKiller, Rayquaza)
    listed EVs let Zekrom take two max attack LO Ho-Oh brave birds after switching into rocks one time
    alternate Spread of 252 Atk / 252 SpA / 4 Spe can be used if you want more power. if you want to keep the bulk, you can also shift some SpA EVs to Atk or speed.
    Roost is another solid option for the last slot that allows Zekrom to take advantage of the many switches it forces agains defensive teams


Usage Tips
========

    Excellent Groudon lure. Can also very effectively hit Giratina forms who try to WoW it
    makes a good mid game poke able to capitalize on slower walls or other pokes it forces out
    prediction is important, since there are immunities to both of its STABs


Team Options
========

    Water types are good partners since Zekrom still appreciates Groudon being removed (so do water types since they don't appreciate the sun it brings). Waters can also take Ice type attacks aimed at Zekrom. Zekrom can also use predicted Electric type attacks to switch in, not fearing paralysis. Scarf Kyogre in particular can get rid of Ground Arceus, Zekroms biggest counter
    Arceus-Grass can take on offensive Kyogres as well as faster dragons Zekrom struggles with. Arceus also appreciates flying types gone
    Spikes support is actually more appreciated in the case of Zekrom than SR as Zekrom OHKOes most flying types anyway.
    Wish support is not mandatory but nice. Jirachi can take many attacks aimed at Zekrom
    Mega Gengar for the same reasons as the scarf set

Tailwind
########
name: Tailwind
move 1: Tailwind
move 2: Bolt Strike
move 3: Draco Meteor
move 4: Volt Switch / Outrage / Focus Blast
ability: Teravolt
item: Life Orb
nature: Naughty / Lonely
evs: 252 Atk / 80 SpA / 176 Spe

Moves
========

    Tailwind gives Zekrom a nice Boost to its speed allowing it to strike before many otherwise faster pokes such as Xerneas, Scarfed Dragons and Arceus
    BS and DM serve the same purposes as the mixed attacker set
    Volt Switch lets Zekrom get out of danger while allowing other teammates to make use of tailwind
    Outrage has more use on this set as the speed boost allows Outrage to be a solid late game move after the opponent's fairy type has been removed. Focus Blast helps Zekrom get past the occasional Ferrothorn


Set Details
========

    Speed EVs allow Zekrom to outspeed anything up to base 108 scarfers (Terrakion)
    if terrakion isn't a concern, you can alternatively 136 EVs into speed to get the jump on Scarf Garchomp under tailwind.
    you can also go the other way with a Naive nature and a spread of 252 Atk / 40 SpA / 216 Spe to outspeed scarf mewtwo although DM's power loss is noticable
    -SpD nature is preferred here since this Zekrom set is more likely to be taking priority attacks which are exclusively physical in ubers


Usage Tips
========

    Nice endgame poke able to break through weakened physical walls and sweep with bolt strike
    mid game it can lure in groudon and deal decent damage to it
    can support slow and powerfull teammembers with it's tailwind, either by volt switching out or sacrificing itself after using the move


Team Options
========

    Specs Kyogre really appreciates tailwind
    so do slow attackers such as groudon
    even faster pokes like mewtwo and deoxys-a appreciate tailwind since it temporarily lets them outspeed the opponents scarfer
    Mega Gengar for the same reasons as the scarf set


Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Dragon Claw
move 4: Volt Switch
ability: Teravolt
item: Choice Band
nature: Lonely / Naughty
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe

Moves
========

    CB Bolt Strike has massive damage output, always OHKOing 4 HP / 0 Def Xerneas, any common Palkia set and dealing massive damage even to its resists (39.7 - 46.8% vs 252 HP / 0 Def Ferrothorn and 37.1 - 43.9% to 252 HP / 0 Def Arceus Grass)
    Outrage also has ridiculous power, always 2HKOing 252 / 252+ Hippowdon after a round of leftovers recovery as well as having a 84% chance to 2HKO 252 / 252+ Groudon after a round of leftovers with no hazards up at all
    DC allows to soften up the opponents team early and mid game without having to lock yourself into OR right away
    Volt switch allows you to keep momentum on predicted switches


Set Details
========

    max attack for max power, 252 HP to be able to take at least one hit, since Zekrom is really slow anyway
    there's really no other options considering the moveset
    HP evs can be shifted into speed, making a speed boosting nature viable -> Hasty / Naive



Usage Tips
========

    this Zekrom is meant to be played aggressively. instead of luring in your usual checks like Groudon, Hippo and Ferrothorn and hitting them, you'll aim to just power through them for your teammates to finish the job
    be careful staying in for more than one turn though, since there are immunities to all of your moves
    very reliant on prediction


Team Options
========

    Zekrom appreciates being paired with pokes that are able to capitalize on those pokemon afterwards. again, scarfed kyogre enjoys having opposing weather starters weakened, as does the specs set
    Ho-Oh enjoys Groudon and Hippo getting weakened
    Mega Gengar for the same reasons as the scarf set


Other Options
########

    Substitute
    Hone Claws
    Roost
    Hopefully some other moves it gets in X/Y
    Dragon Tail can be used on the Mixed set to force opposing switch ins like groundon into KO range of DM easier
