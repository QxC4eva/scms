    Usage Tips
    ########
    -Chansey can reliably switch in against many Special Attackers and weaker Physical Attackers.
    -Because Special Attackers can not beat Chansey without set up, most Special Attackers have to switch into a Physical Attacker. You can predict this and cripple them with status.
    -If it is a Pokemon with setup moves like Calm Mind or Quiver Dance, use Toxic or Thunder Wave to cripple them.
    -Since Heal Bell has 8 Power Points, you must use effectively or you may run out of Power points before the match is over.
    -Once all Special Attackers and weak Physical attackers as well as Pokemon with status moves are gone, Chansey becomes dead weight. You can sacrifice Chansey at the appropriate time.

    Team Options
    ########
    -Many Physical walls that is not weak to Fighting is a great partner to Chansey such as Skarmory, Slowbro, Hippodown, and Gliscor.
    -Any Pokemon that can beat a Ghost type such as Tyranitar, Mandibuzz, and other Dark-type Pokemon works well with Chansey.
    -Any Pokemon with Will-o-Wisp such as Rotom-W and Sableye can help Chansey wall off Physical attacks better.
    -Ghost-type Pokemon in general helps check the Fighting-Type Pokemon.


    Other Options
    #########
    -Chansey can run a Counter set with Soft-boiled, Counter, Seismic Toss, and status move catches Physical attackers off-guard and KO.
    -Chansey does not have the stats to run to be a Special Attacker as its Special Attack is low plus its reliance on Eviolite. However, it can run Flamethrower or Ice Beam to suprise one of its counters.

    Checks and Counters
    ##############
    -Any Physical Fighting type Pokemon such as Lucario, Conkeldurr, and Terrokion can scare off Chansey quite easily. All Fighting types that does not have Guts need to be worried about Toxic and Thunder Wave.
    -Skarmory, Forretress, Ferrothorn, and other Steel-Type with Entry Hazard can safely set up on Chansey. Ferrothorn can go farther with Leech Seed, giving Ferrothorn 25% recovery per turn.
    -Magic Guard Clefable and Reuniclus with Calm Mind can set up on Chansey and eventually KO it.
    -Gliscor with Taunt completely shuts down Chansey as it can easily recover lost HP with Poison Heal.
    -Pokemon such as Gengar and Defensive Heatran can stop Chansey, but Chansey will still be able to support its team.
    -Any Pokemon with Taunt, especially Ghost-types, can shut down Chansey.
    -Any strong Choice Band user such as Victini and Kyurem-B can do a lot of damage to Chansey.
    -Any strong physical setup users will force Chansey out.
    -Scizor and Genesect can switch in safely, besides the rare Flamethrower and the fear of being paralyzed.
    -Any Physical attacker that can do 50% or more to Chansey checks her fairly well.
    -Pokemon with Knock Off can let weaker Physical attackers muscle past Chansey easier.
