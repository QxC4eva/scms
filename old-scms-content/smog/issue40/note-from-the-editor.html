    <p>Hi there! If you were looking for an editor's note from Toast++, he's been busy with wrapping up the awards preparations, so here's me picking up the crumbs instead.</p>
   
    <p>The voting round for The Smog 2014 Awards has begun! This year, there was a grand total of 268 submissions, which was more than ever, so thank you to all of those who exercised their democratic rights. On the other hand, the massive number of entries meant more work to do and ended up causing the release of this issue to be somewhat delayed, so we apologize! At last, you can navigate to <a href="/smog/awards/voting">this page</a> to cast your votes and seal the fates of the nominees.</p>
   
    <p>We'd also like to offer a sincere farewell to <a href="/forums/members/118474/">Level 51</a>, longtime contributor to The Smog's Trivia series and eventually the Puzzle Pages, who will be departing from his role as of next issue to address some real-life obligations. Please wish him all the best!</p>
 
    <p>Of course, we'd like to thank our dear readers as well as our beloved <a href="contributors">contributors</a>, without whom this issue wouldn't have been possible.</p>
 
    <p>If you have any questions or comments about this issue or The Smog in general, you can pipe up within the release thread, send an email to thesmog[at]smogon[dot]com, or simply message any of the staff members directly.</p>
 
    <p>Be sure to send in your votes, and have a lovely weekend!</p>
