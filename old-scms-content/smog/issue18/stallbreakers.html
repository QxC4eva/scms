<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>With offense being the dominant team style in the current  metagame, a lot of teams focus  merely on trying to cover as many offensive threats as possible. However, those  teams can easily be walled cold by common stall teams, and if you too  find yourself having no way of beating stall, you can try using an  effective stallbreaker on your team. A stallbreaker,  you ask?  Yes, there are actually some Pokemon that can deal with stall  teams if  not prepared for properly! Keep on reading to find out...</p>

<h2>Some Effective Stallbreakers</h2>

<h3>Calm Mind Reuniclus</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/609.png" alt="" /><br />
Reuniclus @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Magic Guard<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>Reuniclus is one of the top threats to stall teams, as he is immune to   residual damage thanks to Magic Guard, and can recover off any damage   taken from attacks with Recover while setting up with Calm Mind. Being   immune to residual damage, which is a stall team's main form of damage, is surely a big plus, and stall thus has to rely on unboosted direct attacks to damage him.  This is where Reuniclus's EV spread comes in: it ensures that even  physical attacks do laughable damage which can be healed off with  Recover later on, and Calm Mind anyway makes Reuniclus almost  invulnerable to special attacks. Once Reuniclus has enough Calm  Minds up, not much on a stall team can stop him; he can beat even the usual special walls  in Blissey or Chansey.</p>

<p>Psyshock is an option over Psychic, as it lets you beat other Reuniclus,   as well as Calm Mind Latias. However, it doesn't have much use besides   that, as Chansey and Blissey are already easily beaten. Life Orb is an   option over Leftovers for more power, and it also doesn't give recoil  thanks to Magic Guard, but the extended longevity afforded by Leftovers is often missed.</p>

<p>However, every Pokemon comes with its counters, and Reuniclus is no   exception. Spiritomb is the best Reuniclus counter out there you can   find, being immune to both Psychic and Focus Blast; it can then set up its own Calm Mind on Reuniclus, or trap it with Pursuit.  However, Spiritomb doesn't  have many other effective roles, and you're  usually better off using  other Pokemon in that slot. Specially defensive Jirachi is also an excellent counter to Reuniclus, as it takes almost nothing from his attacks, with not even Focus Blast after six Calm Minds OHKOing. He can  paralyze Reuniclus with Thunder Wave or Body Slam and proceed to spam  Iron Head, while Reuniclus only has a 30% chance of  attacking (21%  when factoring in Focus Blast's accuracy). Jirachi can also use Wish to  heal off any damage he might receive. Specially defensive  Swords Dance Scizor can set up on Reuniclus too, comfortably taking even Reuniclus's boosted attacks and healing off damage with Roost, while OHKOing with a +2 Bug Bite. Specially defensive Tyranitar can  also take on Reuniclus quite nicely, 2HKOing with  Crunch while  surviving a Focus Blast; this is even easier when  carrying a Chople  Berry. Bulky Psychic-types resist both Psychic and  Focus Blast, so Mew  and Deoxys-D  can stall Reuniclus out with a combination of Taunt, Seismic Toss, and  Recover. Latias can set up Calm Minds alongside  Reuniclus and use Roar  to phaze him out when set-up, proceeding  to sweep the other team. Finally, most Trick users shut down Reuniclus as they can  outspeed and lock him into either Calm Mind or Recover.</p>

<h3>Taunt + Will-O-Wisp Mew</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/151.png" alt="" /><br />
Mew @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Synchronize<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 224 Def / 32 Spe<br />
Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Will-O-Wisp<br />
- Softboiled<br />
- Psychic</p>

<p>The combination of Taunt, Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, and a recovery move is   an excellent way of beating stall. Mew is probably the best one to   execute that strategy, having enough  Speed to outspeed all common walls as well as solid bulk to take their  attacks. With Taunt forcing walls to attack and making them unable to  recover, and Will-O-Wisp slowly whittling down their health, they will fall  eventually; the only thing you have to do is keep using Softboiled and Taunt whenever necessary until they  faint.  He isn't useless against  offensive teams either, doing an excellent  job at walling most, if not  all, Fighting-types by resisting their main  STAB move, burning them with  Will-O-Wisp, and dealing heavy damage with Psychic.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Mew has some other options to use. Seismic Toss is a good  option over Psychic, dealing more consistent damage;  Ice Beam is also a  good choice, as Gliscor could otherwise be  troublesome for Mew, being  immune to Will-O-Wisp thanks to Toxic Orb,  and not taking much from  Psychic or Seismic Toss. Ice Beam also hits  Dragonite hard, KOing if  Multiscale is broken. The given Speed  EVs are to outrun max Speed  Tyranitar, while also outrunning most  walls, but you can bump up your  Speed to 92 EVs to outspeed Adamant  Dragonite if Ice Beam is used. Other notable options over Psychic include: Aura  Sphere, to hit Tyranitar hard and deal decent damage to Steel-types such as  Heatran and Ferrothorn; Flamethrower, to roast Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Forretress; and  finally, U-turn, as Mew forces a lot of switches, allowing you to keep the  advantage on your side.</p>

<p>Specially defensive Heatran is the most common Mew counter on stall  teams, being immune to Will-O-Wisp, resisting Psychic, and having the ability to  set  up Stealth Rock or use Lava Plume when Taunted to eventually burn  Mew.  This works even better when you manage to nab a Flash Fire boost  by  switching Heatran into Will-O-Wisp. Calm Mind Latias can use Mew as   setup fodder when played right, but must be wary of getting outstalled   by Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Softboiled. A combination of Slowbro and   Blissey can PP stall Mew to death, as while Blissey doesn't need to worry about Will-O-Wisp with Natural Cure, Slowbro gets healed each time it switches with Regenerator; both also have reliable recovery to heal off any damage taken from Mew's attacks.</p>

<p>Jellicent can run a similar set with Scald over Psychic, and an EV   spread of 248 HP / 216 Def / 44 Spe. Jellicent's main advantage over Mew   is that it's a spinblocker, which is beneficial to stall teams. It also has the added bonus of beating Heatran as opposed to Mew,  taking Heatran's attacks easily with his great special bulk and  Water typing, healing off any damage taken with Recover, and Scalding it for a good amount of damage. Beware though that Jellicent is much slower  than Mew, meaning  it gets outsped much more often. It also has  significantly less physical bulk than Mew.</p>

<p>While he may seem completely  inferior at first glance, Sableye too can run such a set, as he  has one big advantage: Prankster.  Prankster gives all of Sableye's  moves bar Night Shade priority, meaning  that he always goes first when  using Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, or Recover,  which is helpful when stopping a physical sweeper  or Taunting a fast wall such as Jirachi with significant investment in Speed. Sableye also has no weaknesses, but that is mostly nullified by his awful stats: even strong STAB moves usually OHKO Sableye, which  is the main reason not to use him.</p>

<h3>Mixed Salamence</h3>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
    <img src="/smog/issue18/stallbreakers_salamence.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/373.png" alt="" /><br />
Salamence @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 116 Atk / 216 SpA / 176 Spe<br />
Rash Nature (+SpA, -SpD)<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Brick Break<br />
- Roost</p>

<p>Using a mixed sweeper to break through stall is usually very effective.   This Salamence in particular can use Draco Meteor to OHKO almost all of   the common switch-ins to the Dragon  Dance set. Draco Meteor is also still  a great move against stall, KOing  or denting every Pokemon that isn't a  Steel-type, Blissey, Chansey, or  Tyranitar. Steel-types bar Heatran are  taken care of by a strong Fire  Blast, while Blissey, Chansey, and  Tyranitar won't enjoy Brick Break.  Intimidate and Roost also provide a lot of longevity, which is helpful when stall tries to wear Salamence down.</p>

<p>As opposed to Brick Break and Roost  in the last two slots, Earthquake  and Outrage are also a good option.  Outrage actually hits Chansey and  Blissey harder than Brick Break,  while also dealing more damage in  general. Salamence can  then drop Brick Break for Earthquake, which does a great  job at  hitting Heatran and Jirachi, as well as Tyranitar, although not  as hard  as Brick Break in the latter's case. However, this will often shorten Salamence's sweep, with Outrage  locking Salamence in and no Roost to heal off Life Orb and Stealth Rock  damage.</p>

<p>Usually, Salamence doesn't have a lot of counters on stall teams besides   Cresselia, who takes upwards of 80% from a combination of Draco Meteor   and Outrage. However, it's still not a KO, meaning that Cresselia can then OHKO with Ice Beam.  In the rain, Steel-types will be harder to handle  due to rain halving  Fire Blast's power. Bronzong will be able to take  any attack from  Salamence, and Hidden Power Ice or Gyro Ball will do a  ton of damage back. Skarmory can also handle Salamence in the rain, but likes a  specially defensive EV spread to handle Draco Meteors and Fire  Blasts relatively well. Jirachi can take on sets lacking  Earthquake in the rain,  thanks to his great overall bulk and typing.  After a Draco Meteor,  you'll see that a lot of other Pokemon can take on  Salamence due to the  halved Special Attack, but Salamence would have probably done the damage by then.</p>

<p>Infernape also makes a great mixed sweeper, as with a moveset of Fire  Blast, Close Combat, Grass Knot, and Stone Edge, it's hard to wall. With  two powerful STAB moves having good coverage, and two great  coverage moves to hit the likes of Jellicent, Slowbro, and Gyarados with,  stall teams will have trouble switching into it. However, Life Orb recoil will wear him down, and so with  correct prediction he'll go down fast. He also still has some hard  counters such as Latias and Tentacruel.</p>

<h3>Swords Dance Gliscor</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/477.png" alt="" /><br />
Gliscor @ Toxic Orb<br />
Ability: Poison Heal<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 184 Def / 72 Spe<br />
Impish Nature (+Def, -SpA)<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Fang<br />
- Taunt</p>

<p>Gliscor has some unique features that make him a good stallbreaker, and the   first of them is Poison Heal, which makes him immune to poison damage   and even lets him heal from it! When equipped with a Toxic Orb, this   also makes him immune to all other status. Second is its good  base Speed, typing, and bulk paired with Taunt. He can Taunt a lot of  common stall Pokemon and easily set up Swords Dance on them as they usually can't do much more than what he will heal from Poison Heal.  Gliscor will have an impressive Attack stat at +6, and with  STAB Earthquake and Ice Fang having great coverage, not much will like  to take a hit from Gliscor.</p>

<p>Facade is a solid option over Ice Fang, hitting harder in general,  but Ice Fang provides much better coverage. Without Ice Fang,  you're also  walled by opposing Gliscor, as well as Gengar. This EV  spread allows  you to outspeed Adamant Breloom, while also maintaining  as much physical  bulk as possible to wall opposing Fighting-types. You  can bump up the  Speed a few points to have the advantage against  Standard Rotom-W  though, which is especially useful when using Facade.</p>

<p>Rotom-W completely walls Gliscor, while also outspeeding with enough  Speed investment, and KOing with STAB Hydro Pump. He must be wary of  Facade though, but Rotom-W usually outspeeds Gliscor, so that's not too  big of an issue. Bronzong also walls Gliscor and can take it out in two hits with Hidden Power Ice while   resisting Facade and being immune to Toxic, which is commonly found on   other Gliscor sets. Slowbro can take Gliscor's hits quite reasonably   with his great physical bulk, and can 2HKOing with STAB Scald. Gyarados can  also wall Gliscor well, packing Intimidate and being immune to Earthquake; it can then dispose of Gliscor with STAB Waterfall.</p>

<h3>Nasty Plot Azelf</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/487.png" alt="" /><br />
Azelf @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Psyshock<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting</p>

<p>With Gen 5 came Psyshock, a special move that hits the target's Defense. Because of that, special sweepers with STAB Psyshock, such as Nasty Plot Azelf,  can now  easily bypass Blissey and Chansey, and they can go "mixed" without even  having to split their EVs, wreaking havoc against stall. After a Nasty Plot, Azelf will have  a Special Attack stat of 696, which is further boosted by Life Orb; not  much will be able to take a Psyshock after that besides walls packing resistances.  Flamethrower takes care of most of those, KOing Steel-types such as  Ferrothorn, Scizor, and  Jirachi. Hidden Power Fighting occupies the  last slot, as it OHKOes  Tyranitar and dents Heatran, meaning that if he  is weakened you'll get  an opportunity to sweep.</p>

<p>The EV spread might seem weird for a sweeper. The reason why Speed isn't  maxed out, though, is the fact that Hidden Power Fighting always lowers  your Speed IV, meaning you can't Speed tie with Starmie anyway. Only 228 EVs are thus invested in Speed, allowing Azelf to outspeed Tornadus.  Grass  Knot is an option over Hidden Power Fighting in the last slot,  KOing  Quagsire and still hitting Tyranitar hard, while also keeping a  31 Speed  IV, so you can use a simple 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe spread.  You will  get horribly walled by Heatran though, so beware of that.</p>

<p>Azelf doesn't have a lot of common counters found on stall teams, though  Latias and Deoxys-D work well. Latias can take any attack from Azelf,  and deal a good amount of damage back with Dragon Pulse. This only works  if Azelf is weakened though, as Psyshock is a clean 2HKO while Dragon  Pulse does 56% maximum. Deoxys-D works even better, avoiding the 2HKO from both Flamethrower and Psyshock if he's using a 252 HP / 4 Def / 252  SpD Calm EV spread. Deoxys-D can thus Toxic Azelf and stall him out  with Recover. Once you know Azelf's last move, he will also be easier to  deal with, as Quagsire can beat Hidden Power Fighting variants thanks  to Unaware, while Heatran completely walls Grass Knot variants. Another  way of dealing with Azelf for stall teams is using a revenge killer.  Choice Scarf Tyranitar, for example, outspeeds Azelf and can trap him with Pursuit, or simply KO with Crunch.</p>

<p>Calm Mind Latios can abuse STAB Psyshock while also using his great  Dragon-type  STAB. Because of that, he has great coverage with just one move,  and  with Surf in the last slot the only Pokemon that will be walling you  is  Ferrothorn. Specially defensive Tyranitar and Scizor will still pose  a  problem though, taking Surfs with ease and using Crunch or Bug Bite to get rid  of Latios.</p>

<p>Calm Mind Alakazam is another option, and while he may seem inferior  because he's much easier to wall due to his reliance on the inaccurate Focus Blast to hit  Steel-types, Magic Guard helps a ton. An immunity to residual damage  and Life Orb recoil helps a lot, as Alakazam can't be worn down easily. He also  outspeeds Choice Scarf Tyranitar and KOes with Focus Blast. Pokemon such as Jirachi and Bronzong can  take a Focus Blast rather easily though; while Bronzong OHKOes with Gyro Ball, Jirachi just needs a bit of prior damage to KO.</p>

<p>Finally, Calm Mind Espeon is another option that shouldn't be   underrated. Magic Bounce is an amazing ability, bouncing back any entry   hazard, status move, or Taunt, which means that he can totally shut  down  stall. However, Espeon is even more easily walled than Alakazam,  having  only Hidden Power Fighting to hit Steel-types. However, seeing  Espeon  on Team Preview means stall players must play much more carefully,  which makes it easier for you to play against them.
</p>

<h3>Swords Dance Toxicroak</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/459.png" alt="" /><br />
Toxicroak @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Dry Skin<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Cross Chop<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Sucker Punch</p>

<p>Swords Dance users are always good against stall, especially  Fighting-types.  This  Toxicroak in particular does a good job at that. While his stats  and  movepool are inferior to other Fighting-types, his ability more  than  makes up for it. Recovering 12.5% at the end of each turn in rain  means  that he can't be stalled  out with Life Orb recoil. Toxicroak also has a  strong priority move in  Sucker Punch, and while it is a tad unreliable,  it prevents him from  being revenge killed by the likes of Tornadus and  Latios. Ice Punch is  also a great move for Toxicroak, OHKOing Gliscor  who usually hard  counters Fighting-types.</p>

<p>There are some other Swords Dancing Fighting-types that work well.  Terrakion has near-perfect coverage with just its two STAB moves,   meaning that it can use Rock Polish in the last slot. That way, you can   take a look at the opponent's team with Team Preview and then decide what you want to set up: Swords Dance for stall teams and Rock Polish for offensive teams. He also works great on sand teams with the sandstorm boosting  his Special Defense, giving him many more opportunities to set up.</p>

<p>Swords Dance Lucario works very similar to Toxicroak, with ExtremeSpeed  over Sucker Punch. He works better than  Toxicroak on teams that don't use rain  thanks to his higher base Attack, Close Combat, and  ExtremeSpeed. He  also has a rather good defensive typing which gives him  an immunity to  Toxic and 4x Rock- and Dark-type resistances. Finally, Swords Dance Virizion can  prove to be an effective bulky sweeper, since he has excellent special  bulk and handy resistances to Water- and Grass-type attacks, which can  help against rain teams as well. It also allows him to set up on Gliscor  with ease.</p>

<h3>Wobbuffet</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/202.png" alt="" /><br />
Wobbuffet @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Shadow Tag<br />
EVs: 200 Def / 56 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Encore<br />
- Counter<br />
- Mirror Coat<br />
- Tickle</p>

<p>While Wobbuffet can't 6-0 stall teams all by himself, he does a great   job at helping you beat them. After Team Preview, you can scout for the   main counter to one of your sweepers, and eliminate it with Wobbuffet.   Once that counter attacks, you can switch to Wobbuffet, Encore it, and   then use either Counter or Mirror Coat to eliminate him. If they use an   non-attacking move when you switch in Wobbuffet, you can Encore that  move, Tickle  six times to lower the opponent's Defense to a minimum,  and switch to a  Pursuiter. That way, the opponent will take a ton of  damage regardless  of whether or not he switches out. You can also use  Encore to give a  sweeper an opportunity to set up, as something like Lucario  loves to come in on Toxic and wreak havoc.</p>

<p>While the EV spread might seem weird, it allows you to outspeed a lot of   common walls and Encore them before they can change moves. If you  don't  care about outspeeding them, you can use max HP with 228 EVs in  one  defensive stat and 28 EVs in the other. Safeguard is an option over Tickle, as in conjunction with Encore, it allows sweepers to set up freely without fearing status.</p>

<p>Magnezone is also a very  effective trapper, especially when your main sweeper is a Dragon-type; it can eliminate the pesky Steel-types which have a Dragon-type resistance or even set up on them with a SubCharge set.  That way,  you're usually able to get two kills with Magnezone, as  nothing likes  taking a hit from a +6 Magnezone. Choice Band  Dragon-types such as  Haxorus and Dragonite also become much more  dangerous when using  Magnezone, as Skarmory lacking Shed Shell will  easily be gotten rid off.</p>

<p>Dugtrio is the last viable trapper, taking out threats such as Heatran and Tentacruel. He can also get rid  of any  grounded Pokemon at low health. While you can use a simple  Choice Band  set, a Reversal set is also very effective, eliminating the  likes of  Tyranitar and Chansey much more easily. Reversal Dugtrio is  mainly  effective on weather teams, as he traps and kills most weather  inducers  rather easily.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As you can see, preparing for stall teams isn't all that hard. Packing a   stallbreaker or two can help a lot when you find yourself having   trouble with stall. You can also try certain combinations of Pokemon   that do well against stall, as stallbreaking is not limited to a single  Pokemon. For example, using Stealth Rock and Spikes also helps against  stall, as they secure you some KOs and limit switching. U-turn and Volt Switch also help as they shift the momentum to your side, which can be crucial to the success of stall. Now GET OUT THERE!</p>
