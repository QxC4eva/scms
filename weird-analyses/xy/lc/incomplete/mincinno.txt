Moves

EVs max Attack and Speed, with the remaining EVs placed in Def and SpD to slightly increase bulk.
Jolly is the preferred nature, as it allows you to outspeed Jolly Minefoo and KO it without risking a speed tie

Usage Tips
========

Spam Tail Slap, as it is a powerful move that hits most of the tier hard.
Utilize Knock Off to hit Ghosts, while also removing there item.
Knock Off is an excellent move to use early on as well, as it allows you to weaken opponents, which is quite useful.
U-turn away if the match up is unfavorable.
U-Turn can be spammed as well, as it puts pressure on the opposing team.
Use Wake-Up Slap to break Steel types that would otherwise come in safe on Minccino.

Team Options
========

As this set functions well as a wallbreaker, Set up sweepers such as Scraggy and Tirtouga make good teammates as they appreciate bulky opponents removed.
Larvesta and Spritzee are both good partners, as they can take Fighting attacks that would otherwise maime Minccino.
Entry hazard support, particularly Stealth Rocks is helpful for netting KOs. As such Dwebble makes a fantastic partner
Chinchou and Mienfoo can help form a decent VoltTurn core.
Sticky Web can helpful as well, especially if running Adamant.
Bulky attackers also are helpful in taking the priority attacks aimed at Minccino.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Tail Slap
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Wake-Up Slap
ability: Skill Link
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 196 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 236 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Moves are identical to Life Orb set
Once again, Tail Slap is mainly what you will be using.
Wake-Up Slap is for Steels and Rocks that would otherwise stop you.
U-turn is a very good move that allows you to scout.

Set Details
========

EVs are identical to the Life Orb set, allowing Minccino to outspeed a large portion of the tier.
With a Choice Scarf equipped, Minccino's decent 17 speed skyrockets up to the impressive 25, outspeeding the majority of the tier, as well as more than a few Scarfers.
Jolly is not recommended, as Minccino needs all the power it can get, and is already impressively fast.

Usage Tips
========

This set functions well as both a late game sweeper and a revenge killer.
Knock Off and. U-turn should be used early on, as they weaken opponents while also making it easier for Minccino to sweep late game.
Removing opposing Normal type immunities/resists should be your top priority.
If you predict a ghost type switch in, use Knock Off to give them a nasty surprise.
The above applies to Steel Types with Wake-Up Slap.

Team Options
========

Teammates that can remove Steels, Rocks, and Ghosts are essential.
Drilbur makes a fantastic teammate, as it can provide Stealth Rocks, Rapid Spin, and Mold Breaker Earthquakes to smash apart the Pokemon that would otherwise stop Minccino.
Mienfoo can switch in on Rock and Steel types while also forming VoltTurn core
As this set will be switching quite a bit, Defogers such as Vullaby are appreciated for keeping residual damage away from Minccino.
Stunky and Pawniard are both decent teammates, as they can trap and KO Ghost Types with Pursuit.
Magnemite is a useful partner, as it can trap and defeat Steel types with Hidden Power Fire.

Other Options
########

Substitute is a decent option, as it does allow you to avoid Sucker Punch, but Minccino generally has little room on it's sets to give up.
Minccino has a colorful movepool, including Thunder Wave and Tickle, but is too frail to pull of a supporting role.
King's Rock is a possibility, but is generally inferior to Life Orb due to its inconsistency
Protect could be used for blocking Fake Out and scouting, but Minccino rarely wants to give up any moveslot.
Aqua Tail and Seed Bomb both have higher base power than Wake-Up Slap, but do not hit steels and otherwise provide redundant coverage.

Checks & Counters
########

Steel types in general make good counters to Minccino, but must beware of Wake-Up Slap. Ferroseed in particular is an excellent counter, as it rips of a large portion of Minccino's health by simply switching into Tail Slap.
Priority users such as Panwiard, Meditite, Timburr, Croagunk and Mienfoo can override your speed and maime you with with their priority moves.
Faster Scarfers and Pokemon that reach 19 speed, such as Murkrow, can outspeed and capitalize on your fragility.
Bulky Rock Types such as Tyrunt, Dwebble, and Tirtouga can come in and set-up on Minccino, but must be wary of Knock Off and Wake-Up Slap.
Misdreavus can come in on Tail Slap and set up a Nasty Plot or cripple you with Will-O-Wisp, but again must take care to avoid the Knock Off
Fighting Types will tear apart Minccino if given the chance
