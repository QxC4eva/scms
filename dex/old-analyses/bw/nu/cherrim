[Overview]

<p>Cherrim is a very odd Pokemon. At first glance, it looks like any other Grass-type Pokemon, just without moves such as Sleep Powder. However, Cherrim's ability, Flower Gift, is the reason why Cherrim can be so good. Under sunny weather, Cherrim's Attack and Special Defense are raised by 50%. This, along with its Grass-type STAB and decent coverage attacks, as well as a way to keep itself status free, makes Cherrim an excellent physical attacker in NU. However, it isn't all sunshine and daisies for Cherrim. With only base 85 Speed, it has a hard time keeping up with Pokemon such as Rapidash, Swellow, and Simisear. Also, with poor base 70 Defense, it is easy to take out with physical attacks. Nevertheless, Cherrim is a decent option for a sun team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set makes full use of Cherrim's ability, Flower Gift, which makes it a viable physical attacker in NU. Thanks to Heat Rock, once Cherrim sets up a Sunny Day, it is in effect for 8 turns unless the opponent changes the weather. Seed Bomb is a physical STAB, dealing massive damage in sunlight--OHKOing Carracosta, for example. Aromatherapy makes Cherrim more difficult to take down, as it heals Cherrim and its teammates from status. However, the main thing that sets Cherrim apart from other Grass-type Pokemon in the tier is Nature Power. Nature Power becomes Earthquake on simulator and Wi-Fi battles, giving Cherrim a way to hit Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon in the tier, such as Rapidash and Mawile.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>Adamant is the main nature of this set, as it allows Cherrim to use it's boosted Attack in sun; however, a Jolly nature can also be used to Speed tie with Pokemon such as Sawk and Pinsir. Additionally, 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 SpD with an Adamant nature gives Cherrim 381 Special Defense in sun, allowing it to take advantage of the Attack and Special Defense boosts. 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD with a Careful nature gives Cherrim maximum special bulk in the sun. 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Atk with an Impish nature gives Cherrim maximum Defense, while still boosting Attack and Special Defense. In any case, if using a defensive EV Spread, utilizing moves such as Synthesis and Leech Seed allows Cherrim to stay on the field longer.</p>

<p>As Cherrim still has problems with Flying-type Pokemon, a Rock-type partner can be useful to help it beat these threats. Regirock is a prime example, as it can set up Stealth Rock, isn't OHKOed by Choice Scarf Braviary's Superpower, and can OHKO back with Stone Edge. Carracosta is another great example, as it can use Shell Smash to outspeed most of Cherrim's checks and OHKO them with Stone Edge. It also has great priority in Aqua Jet, meaning it can pick off weakened Fire-type Pokemon and KO them. Also, Probopass can trap Steel-type Pokemon via Magnet Pull, and gives them a hard time thanks to its attacks. Also, using Cherrim on a sun team while using other sun sweepers such as Exeggutor and Victreebel alongside Cherrim is also a good idea. Utilizing the sun Cherrim can set up, its teammates can hit hard and fast, making it tough for the opponent to react.</p>

[SET] 
name: Special Sunny Day
move 1: Sunny Day

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While this set might seem outclassed by Exeggutor, it has its own merits. It has the ability to use either Aromatherapy or Healing Wish, both of which are useful. Aromatherapy can be used to cure status from the team, as well as itself, while Healing Wish can be used when Cherrim is done with it's job, meaning that a teammate can come in at full health and potentially turn the course of a battle. Solar Beam can be used to abuse Sun, though when Sun isn't up, it won't be as effective. Therefore, Giga Drain is a viable alternative, as it is also usable outside of sun, and also provides useful healing. Lastly, the choice of Hidden Power is of personal preference. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel- and Grass-types, and is also stronger in sun. However, this leaves Cherrim at the mercy of Flash Fire Pokemon, such as Rapidash or Flareon. Therefore, Hidden Power Rock can be used, as it hits said Fire-type Pokemon, as well as Flying-types such as the popular Swellow.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>A Modest nature is used, as it gives Cherrim the most use of its base 87 Special Attack; Timid can also be used to Speed tie with max Speed Sawk. This will not matter if using Hidden Power Rock or Hidden Power Fire, however, as such Hidden Powers force an imperfect Speed IV, so Modest should be used instead. An alternative spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 SpD with a Modest nature allows Cherrim to still hit hard, while giving it more Special Defense. 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD with a Calm nature gives it maximum special bulk in sun. Lastly, 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA with a Bold nature grants Cherrim maximum Defense. Like the other defensive EV spreads, Synthesis and Leech Seed should be utilized to make the most of it's bulk.</p>

<p>As Cherrim still has problems with Flying- and Steel-type Pokemon, a Rock-type partner can help Cherrim beat these threats. Regirock is a prime example, as it can set up Stealth Rock and isn't OHKOed by Choice Scarf Braviary's Superpower, and it can OHKO back with Stone Edge. Carracosta is another great example, as it can use Shell Smash to outspeed most of Cherrim's checks and OHKO them with Stone Edge. It also has great priority in Aqua Jet, meaning it can pick off weakened Fire-type Pokemon and KO them. Also, Probopass can trap Steel-type Pokemon via Magnet Pull, and it gives them a hard time thanks to its attacks. Also, using Cherrim on a sun team while using other sun sweepers such as Exeggutor and Victreebel alongside Cherrim is also a good idea. Utilizing the sun Cherrim can set up, its teammates can hit hard and fast, making it tough for the opponent to react</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Cherrim, while it does have a shallow movepool, can pull off a few other options. Grass Whistle can be used as a less accurate Sleep Powder, as Cherrim doesn't get Sleep Powder; however, the accuracy is too shaky to be relied on. A SubSeed set can be utilized, though this is done better by Meganium and Serperior. Safeguard is also a viable option, as it makes Cherrim and the rest of its team immune to status for 5 turns. Weather Ball hits harder in Sun than Hidden Power Fire, though it's a 50 Base Power Normal-type attack without sun. Hidden Power Ice can also be used to hit the rare Altaria harder than with Hidden Power Rock, and it can be used without lowering the Speed IV, which is useful.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Cherrim, despite an awesome ability in Flower Gift, isn't invincible. Altaria is a great check, as it is 4x resistant to Grass, immune to the pseudo-Earthquake, and resistant to Hidden Power Fire. However, it must be wary of Hidden Power Rock and Ice. Pokemon with Flash Fire, such as Rapidash, Lampent, and Flareon, counter the Special set if it carries Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ice, as these Pokemon are immune to Fire, and also resist Grass and Ice. Faster physical attackers, such as Swellow and Choice Scarf Braviary, can both outpace and OHKO Cherrim with Brave Bird, though neither will enjoy taking a Flower Gift boosted Seed Bomb.</p>
