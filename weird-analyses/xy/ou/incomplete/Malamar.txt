Overview

contrary superpower is a nice niche but below average stats and poor defensive and offensive typing keep it from making a big splash in OU
shallow movepool
needs a lot of team support


Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest Booster
move 1: Superpower
move 2: Night Slash
move 3: Psycho Cut
move 4: Rock Slide
ability: Contrary
item: Assault Vest
nature: Adamant
evs: 192 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 60 Spe

Moves
========
- standard Malamar move trifecta of Superpower / Night Slash / Psycho Cut
- Rock Slide is Malamar's next best physical attack and it can be very useful to combat threats like togekiss, who normally hard counters Malamar:
252+ Atk Malamar Superpower vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Togekiss: 29-35 (7.7 - 9.3%)
4 SpA Togekiss Dazzling Gleam vs. 196 HP / 0 SpD Assault Vest Malamar: 170-204 (46.9 - 56.3%) -- 80.9% chance to 2HKO
+1 252+ Atk Malamar Rock Slide vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Togekiss: 222-262 (59.3 - 70%) -- guaranteed 2HKO after Leftovers recovery
- after getting an attack boost on the switch, Malamar can outspeed and 2HKO Togekiss with Rock Slide with Togekiss fails to OHKO with Dazzling Gleam.
- similarly, Malamar can also tank Moonblast from Florges and Pixilated Hyper Voice Sylveon thanks to the Assault Vest and deal enough damage with a boosted neutral Psycho Cut to 2HKO.

Set Details
========
- 60 speed lets malamar beat uninvested base 80s
- attack is maxed for maximum damage output
- 196 EVs remain but putting them all into HP results in an even HP stat

Usage Tips
========
- with assault vest, many of malamar's usual counters are lessened in their effectiveness, allowing Malamar to get in an extra Superpower boost or an extra attack.
- physical based counters are still just as effective, especially if they switch in one something besides Superpower
- also be warned of phazers. this set is particularly vulnerable due to a lack of Taunt.
- similarly, this set is also vulnerable to being statused

Team Options
========
- wish support is useful for malamar to be able to take multiple hits.
- malamar also likes sticky web and/or paralysis support.
- this set can help break down a lot of slower tanks and walls, meaning this malamar pairs well with faster sweepers
- for instance: Mega Lucario, Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard X.
- a lot of malamar's counters are physical defensively oriented flying types, meaning a mixed Kyurem-B is a good teammate option to help break those walls down.


Rest Talk
########
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Superpower
move 4: Night Slash / Payback
ability: Contrary
item: Leftovers
nature: Careful
evs: 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 SpD

Moves
========
- relatively straight forward
- rest and sleep talk help malamar's survivability
- night slash and superpower provide good coverage except for fairies
- payback is less consistent but has the potential to be more powerful than night slash if malamar moves second

Set Details
========
- given EVs make Malamar quite bulky and hits hard after a Superpower or 2
- alternative EVs for a more offensive set are: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpDef, Adamant

- if you are using payback, it might be useful to use a Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs to ensure Payback will go last most often.


Usage Tips
========
- even more vulnerable to fairies without a move to even damage them for neutral
- good status taker because of rest.
- try not to let it take any special hits
- beware of superpower's limited pp but note that sleep talk will not use up superpower's pp

Team Options
========
- since this set is completely walled by fairies, taking those fairies out is of the utmost importance if you want to use it!
- fire types make good teammates because the resist both bug and fairy.
- heatran in particular is a good choice because it is pretty bulky on the special side so it doesn't mind taking those hits either.
- rotom-heat also works pretty well. Both of these Pokemon also threaten the Bug/Steels: Scizor and Rotom.
- poison types also resist fire and bug, which makes tentacruel also a good choice to pair with malamar. tentacruel also threatens fairies with STAB poison attacks and with Liquid Ooze, it even covers Volcarona (who would normally hurt water-types with giga drain).
- mega venusaur is a similar option who can take special hits directed towards malamar and threaten fairies with STAB sludge bomb.
-Gengar with Sludge Bomb can take those fairies out but it's frailty means you probably won't be able to switch directly from Malamar to Gengar.
- steel-types will do the same thing. good choices are lucario and scizor, mega and non-mega for each, because they can kill fairies with STAB Technician or Adaptability Bullet Punch or Adaptability Flash Cannon. Scizor is easier to switch into from Malamar thanks to its overall bulkiness while Lucario (esp Mega) more easily dismisses opposing fairies.
- Rest Talk Malamar makes a good status absorber, making him a good option if the rest of the team particularly hates status.
- even with the investment, Malamar is not particularly bulky, meaning


Support Booster
########
name: Support Booster
move 1: Superpower
move 2: Night Slash
move 3: Psycho Cut
move 4: Taunt / Rest
ability: Contrary
item: Leftovers / Chesto Berry
nature: Adamant
evs: 236 HP / 252 Atk / 20 Spe

Moves
========
- superpower is main attack to get boosts
- night slash provides stab and coverage (although neutral, superpower is stronger)
- psycho cut hits fairies and poisons like venusaur
- taunt prevents status and phazing which is important for a boosting pokemon like malamar while rest + chesto gives it somewhat reliable healing.
- other situation moves for the last set include: topsy turvy, hypnosis, light screen.

Set Details
========
- 20 speed lets malamar beat uninvested base 75s (mainly florges) while maxing attack and putting the rest in hp to even out defenses

Usage Tips
========
- take care of fairies and special attackers first
- malamar makes a good aegislash counter (if it doesn't have shadow ball) because of contrary working against king's shield and especially against SD sets if you use Topsy Turvy in the last slot.

Team Options
========
- the same kind of pokemon help out malamar: fire, poison, and steel types with strong STAB attacks such as Heatran, Rotom-H, Tentacruel, Mega Venusaur, Scizor.
- offensively, Malamar goes well with teammates who can take out Malamar's Flying-type counters; Pokemon such as Mixed Aegislash, Kyurem-B, NP Mega Lucario will work well.
- to be fair, Malamar kind of needs all the help it can get, such as sticky web to help out its poor speed.



Other Options
########
- suction cups can be used with calm mind, but malamar has terrible special stats.
- hypnosis.
- scarf with switcheroo could work



Checks & Counters
########
- might be easier to list what doesn't counter malamar in OU
- rotom can switch on any attack, outspeed and burn, and do 45%+ with hydro pump
- azumarill
- togekiss, sylveon, florges on sets besides the AV version
- scizor
- landorus, zapdos is a great counter, especially if it carries u-turn
- mandibuzz hard counters it
- gliscor easily beats non rest talk versions
- dragonite can easily come in and then dd/roost up and ko with literally any move it uses
- skarmory takes little damage and whirlwinds out tauntless malamars. note that without whirlwind, malamar will (eventually) win.
- landorus/-t but watch out because intimidate makes malamar stronger.
- volcorona can come in on any attack (though it resists superpower so that is ideal) and easily OHKO with Bug Buzz which will even go through substitute
- sableye can come in, prankster will-o-wisp and then use its own superpower boosts against it. sableye is also immune to both fighting and psychic, making it extremely easy to switch in.
- salamence can come in on superpower and then 2hko with outrage, but be warned that intimidate will hurt salamence in this case because +2 Psycho Cut or Night Slash will finish the job.

- anything faster with a super effective or strong attack is an effective check:
- genesect
- talonflame, greninja with u-turn
- lucario can revenge kill without a superpower boost
- deoxys-s with u-turn
- terrakion with x-scissor can revenge if malamar is slightly weakened and does not have more than 1 superpower defense boost
- fast special attackers like jolteon and keldeo can revenge non-AV versions
