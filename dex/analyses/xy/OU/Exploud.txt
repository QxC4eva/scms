Moves
========
- Boomburst is the move you'll be using the majority of the time, it is incredibly powerful and can even hit Ghost-types thanks to Scrappy. Even some Steel-types are 2HKOed by Boomburst, including Excadrill, Mega Mawile, and Scizor.
- Overheat covers one half of the Pokemon that resist Boomburst, Steel-types, with Aegislash being the most relevant target.
- Focus Blast hits Rock-types, the other half, most notably Tyranitar.
- Exploud covers so much in these three moves that the move in the fourth slot is basically just preference. Flamethrower hits Steel-types without forcing you out, while Surf is a more reliable method of dealing with Heatran.

Set Details
========
- Choice Specs is necessary as it makes Exploud just so powerful.
- Modest adds to this, and Exploud doesn't need to run a Speed boosting nature as it sits at such an awkward speed tier.
- However, this doesn't stop Speed investment from being useful to benefit from Sticky Web and outspeed things like Rotom-W and other defensive Pokemon.
- The Special Attack investment is obvious to increase Exploud's power.

Usage Tips
========
- Exploud should be used as a wallbreaker as it is too slow to sweep without support. It works better as a wallbreaker because of its immense power, which allows it to simply break through walls.
- Even Pokemon that resist Boomburst take a hefty chunk from it; it is a safe move to use in most situations and is definitely the move that should be used the most.
- Two uses of Overheat is more powerful than two consecutive Flamethrowers, so it is generally the most preferable move to use against Steel-types in most cases.
- Exploud isn't that bulky, so it shouldn't try and frequently switch in on attacks. Try using Volt Switch or U-turn to guarantee it gets in safely.

Team Options
========
- Partners that have some way of remedying Exploud's major flaw&mdash;its poor Speed&mdash;are really helpful. There are a variety of ways to do this; Sticky Web is one of the best as it easy to set and affects the majority of Pokemon that the opponent could send out, and common users of the move are Smeargle and Galvantula. If using Sticky Web, a way of beating Bisharp is recommended, such as Keldeo or Conkeldurr.
- Another way to boost Exploud's Speed is by being the receiver of speed boosts from a Pokemon with Baton Pass. Scolipede is great for this.
- A physical attacking wallbreaker is a great partner to break through the special walls that trouble Exploud. Terrakion, Mega Pinsir, and Kyurem-B are all great in this regard.

Other Options
########
- A Silk Scarf is a good choice as an alternate item as it gives Exploud the freedom to switch moves. It is better used on sets that receive speed boosts though, as otherwise you give up a lot of wallbreaking potential.

Checks & Counters
########
- Chansey and Blissey completely wall Exploud and can also Toxic stall it.
- Strong Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Lucario, and Terrakion can revenge kill Exploud with ease.
- Other Pokemon such as Greninja, Talonflame, Kyurem-B, and Thundurus-T can revenge kill it by virtue of their powerful STAB moves.
- Mach Punch from the likes of Conkeldurr or Breloom is an efficient way of KOing a weakened Exploud.
