<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello all, my name is Molk, and this is my first NU RMT! I play RU and NU a lot, and i would say im pretty good at both tiers, maybe not amazing, but im decent at the tiers. This team is a balanced team involving a defensive core of tangela, flareon and quagsire to wall most threats in the tier, combined with teammates to take on what the two cant handle, including a very underrated threat that can definatley hold its own in battle. I felt this RMT brought something new to the table, and shows how a player can suceed with many different pokemon. The purpose of NU is to explore a tier where almost anything is viable, and i feel two members of this team reflect this. anyways i dont know exactly how great this team is, but it was good enough to let me peak at #1 on the NU ladder with 1409 points. so i decided to post it :), i hope this team isnt total crap and maybe it could help people learn what NU is all about, exploring what pokemon don't stand out at first, but work in practice.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Golem</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Rock Blast<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Sucker Punch</p>

<p>Golem is the pokemon i usually lead off with on this team, and boy am i glad i decided to try him out. Golem always gets his job done, no matter what. whether its setting up stealth rock, or taking down a pokemon or two on the opponents team. It also helps me out against birds, pokemon with substitute, and JYNX early game before sturdy is broken, jynx isnt easy to play around, but one rock blast will take her down easily, other threats such as ninjask and butterfree are equally useles against golem, getting destroyed no matter what. Earthquake rounds off golem's coverage, Koing camerupt, opposing golem, gigalith, and the rare steel-type. Sucker Punch allows golem to pick off weakened and frail pokemon, such as swellow, while also being golem's best move against mesprit. Imo golem is the best lead in NU, sturdy+lum berry endure golem gets at least one turn to hurt things or set up stealth rock golem should not be underestimated under any circumstances, and i hope nobody makes that mistake.</p>

<p><strong>Quagsire</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Unaware<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Scald<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>Quagsire is quite the defensive pokemon, with good physical bulk, a sole weakness to grass moves, access to recover, and the ability to check several boosting sweepers. Quagsire is always an excellent choice for teams needing a wall or check to things like SD samurott and absol. Scald may not be strong, but it lets quagsire burn physical attackers and take their hits better while slowly wearing them down, especially useful against things like sawk. Earthquake is Quagsire's main attacking move, dealing decent amounts of damage to anything that doesnt resist it, while also hitting muk and garbodor hard. Toxic is Quagsire's best defense against tangela, hitting it on the switch as it comes in to try and KO quagsire. Crippling it for the rest of the match. its also very useful for stalling out enemies such as sawk. Recover is standard on quagsire, helping quagsire to take more hits as if nothing happened, quagsire can be hard to wear down if you cant do more than 56% to it, as recover +lefties will heal most of that off, making quagsire quite hard for a team relying on boosting sweepers to handle.</p>

<p><strong>Jynx</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Dry Skin<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- Lovely Kiss</p>

<p>Jynx is the "glue" of this team, revenging pokemon that would otherwise threaten my team, such as swellow, gorebyss, and amoonguss. Jynx also has the ability dry skin, letting it switch in on water moves easily and regain a bit of its health. Ice Beam takes on swellow, braviary, and Rotom-s, and with s scarf, jynx dgaf about how much speed they have. Psychic takes out things such as gorebyss and sawk more easily, as well as the annoying throh. Focus blast does major damage to audino, lickilicky, and miltank, along with probopass and lairon. Lovely kiss may seem strange on a scarfed pokemon. but it really helps out against smart people who switch when i try to revenge kill them. they pay a price, their counter gets put to sleep! i considered running shadow ball here to revenge kill opposing jynx, but lovely kiss is very useful, and indisposable on jynx imo.</p>

<p><strong>Scraggy</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Shed Skin<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Bulk Up<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Rest</p>

<p>This is the guy i was talking about, he really brings a lot to the table, unlike gurdurr, scraggy is a dark-type, allowing it to set up on the many psychics in the tier, as well as being able to kill haunter and misdreavus rather easily. Unlike skuntank, whenever scraggy comes in, it threatens a sweep, and forces a lot of switches, racking up stealth rock damage, it also checks cryogonal, and to an extent jynx, being able to take a +2 ice beam and crunch for the KO. Bulk up boost scraggy's attack and defense, which at first arent amazing (Even though its special defense is impressive) but go up fast, especially because scraggy can find many set up opprotunities vs things like mesprit, cryogonal, and lickilicky. Drain punch allows scraggy to attack and heal at the same time, and seriously damage probopass and bastiodon, as well as other things. with scraggy's low HP stat and high defenses, the HP recovery means a lot. Crunch rounds of scraggy's coverage, hitting things like mesprit, hypno, haunter, and misdreavus where it hurts. Rest heals up scraggy back to full HP in one turn, making it that much harder to break without a sawk, especially when shed skin kicks in to remove its sleep status early. overall a fun pokemon if you know how to use it.</p>

<p><strong>Flareon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Wish<br />
- Protect<br />
- Heal Bell<br />
- Lava Plume</p>

<p>Flareon is the newest addition to my team, it just happens to patch up every weakness my team has, while also providing some nice cleric support. Flareon checks tangela, magmortar, jynx, and cryogonal, while also patching up my ice weakness, despite the stealth rock weakness, flareon is actually really bulky on the special side, with wish to recover HP, and Heal bell to heal my team of status problems, flareon is an excellent cleric and finishes up my FWG core quite nicely. lava plume makes sure flareon isnt total taunt bait, and the burn chance is always handy. Flareon's wish support allows me to heal scraggy up without having to rely on rest, and heal bell heals scraggy of its sleep status so it can come in and threaten a sweep once again, overall a good mon that deserves more usage as a utility counter.</p>

<p><strong>Tangela</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Leech Seed<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>Tangela is awesome, and pairs well with Flareon and Quagsire, forming the infamous "tangelQuag" core that walls almost all of the physical threats in the tier (patent by karpman) Tangela has sleep powder to put opponents to sleep that would otherwise threaten my team, while lech seed stops bulky boosters, forcing them to switch out, giga drain allows tangela to beat down quagsire rather easily, and gives tangela some recovery as well, Hidden Power ice is very important, being Tangela's main move against the birds, opposing grass-types, and ESPECIALLY altaria, who's defensive set can be a real pain in the neck otherwise. Tangela also has regenerator as a form of recovery, making it an excellent defensive pivot and fixes up my torterra weakness quite nicely. Overall an excellent mon, it was actually banned from PO's NU due to its sheer bulk (equal to giratina's). i seriously hope tangela remains a top tier pokemon and never falls out of usage, it is the closest thing to the physical blissey we have, even in OU lol.</p>
