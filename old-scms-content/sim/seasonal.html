<p>Seasonal Ladder was a tier hosted on Pokemon Showdown. Much like Random Battle, the Seasonal Ladder let you play with randomly generated teams; however, not every Pokemon could be randomly generated. The Pokemon that could be generated were based on themes relating to the time of the year. Seasonal Ladder is discontinued and it's no longer available.</p>
