Overview
########
- Flying is a good offensive STAB with no immunities and few resistances which makes Calm Mind pretty deadly.
- Solid bulk aids in setting up, only Arceus forme to be immune to Spikes and Sticky Web.
- Weak to Stealth Rock which hurts its bulk.
- Not too many useful resistances and has annoying weaknesses.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Judgment
move 3: Recover
move 4: Refresh / Earth Power
item: Sky Plate
nature: Timid
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

- Calm Mind boosts your offense and bulk to help you eat special Electric- and Ice-type attacks.
- Judgment is STAB, has solid neutral coverage with few resistances.
- Recover lets you stay alive and accrue multiple boosts.
- Refresh gives status protection and lets Flying Arceus beat Blissey. Useful since Flying as a monoattacking type is very solid.
- Earth Power gives coverage against Zekrom, Dialga, Heatran, and Aegislash.

Set Details
========

- Max Speed is used to tie other Arceus.
- Rest goes into Special Attack since Flying Arceus relies on offensive coverage to sweep rather than bulk.
- Maxing out HP is still viable to potentially nab an extra boost or two.

Usage Tips
========

- Try to set up on things that can't use Thunder like Grass-types, Fighting-types, defensive Mega Scizor, or Yveltal.
- Relies more on offensive coverage than defensive bulk to sweep, so just focus on getting one or two boosts.
- KO the enemy's Choice Scarf Zekrom before you try to sweep, otherwise it won't end well for Flying Arceus.

Team Options
========

- Ground-types since they check Choice Scarf Zekrom/Tyranitar and can also help against Dialga, Heatran, and Aegislash - Groudon, Landorus-T, and Gliscor are solid.
- Excadrill is also nice since it can spin away Stealth Rock and Flying Arceus can come in on Ground-/Fighting-type attacks.
- Palkia checks Kyogre who is really annoying for Flying Arceus.
- Stealth Rock from a Pokemon such as Dialga or Landorus-T + offensive pressure can help keep Ho-Oh at bay.
- Steel-types such as Scizor can take Ice-type moves and check Kyurem-W. Scizor can also Defog which is very helpful.


Other Options
########

- Focus Blast murders Tyranitar/Kyurem-W but does less to Zekrom than Earth Power + Aegislash walls it.
- Defog is kinda cool since Flying Arceus massively trolls Sticky Web teams.
- Stone Edge can be used if you really hate Ho-Oh.
- Will-O-Wisp cripples Zekrom on the switch but leaves Flying Arceus walled by Heatran and is worthless against Ho-Oh.


Checks & Counters
########

- **Zekrom**: Outspeeds Flying Arceus with Choice Scarf and crushes it with Bolt Strike.
- **Electric Arceus**: Sets up Calm Mind on Flying Arceus and will usually win due to having type advantage.
- **Ho-Oh**: Has the bulk to handle any attack and easily KOes Flying Arceus with Sacred Fire.
- **Kyogre**: Offensive sets can overpower Arceus-Flying with Thunder or STAB Water-type attacks and defensive sets can easily phaze it with Roar.
- **Tyranitar**: Beats any set without Focus Blast, can easily take a +1 Earth Power.
- **Steel-types**: Dialga and Heatran (if no Earth Power) can phaze, Aegislash and Bronzong can Toxic sets without Refresh (they will lose to Refresh sets though), Jirachi can go for paraflinch.
