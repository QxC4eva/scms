<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. If the attack misses, the target uses Protect, or the target is a Ghost-type, then the user takes crash damage equal to 1/2 of its max HP, rounded down. This move cannot be used while Gravity is active. Pokemon with the ability Magic Guard are unaffected by crash damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Jump Kick is a decent move, and in this generation transition it was boosted to 100 Base Power, becoming a valid option. However, it has poor distribution and is more or less redundant considering notable would-be users like Mienshao and Hitmonlee also have access to the much more powerful Hi Jump Kick. Thus, the only real user would be Sawsbuck, who can use it as a coverage option to deal with Pokemon that resist his STAB moves.</p>
