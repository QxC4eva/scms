<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Baton Pass can completely make or break a game in just one move. Passing a stat boost to a sweeper who would normally lack the means to boost its stats effectively can have deadly consequences. For the most part, offensive boosts are Baton Passed out on teams not centered around the attack. Gorebyss and Huntail are renowned for being the only two Pokemon in existence (bar Smeargle) to be able to Baton Pass Shell Smash boosts. A Shell Smash Baton Pass to a teammate like Garchomp virtually seals the opponent's fate. Venomoth, an all-around mediocre Pokemon on paper, is saved from obscurity with its ability to put opponents to sleep with Sleep Powder and quickly Baton Pass Quiver Dance boosts. Mew can Baton Pass boosts of nearly any kind and can come in and pass almost always successfully with its 100 / 100 / 100 defenses and access to Taunt. Some teams even base their entire strategy around Baton Pass, constantly boosting and passing to other teammates until the final pass to a nasty sweeper at full power.</p>
