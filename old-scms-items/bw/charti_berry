[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by a Pokemon, reduces the power of a damaging Rock-type move that would hit the holder for super effective damage by 50%. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Rock-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>A Charti Berry can be used if the Pokemon holding it is weak to Rock, but since it is only single-use, and there are few Rock-type attackers that rely entirely on Stone Edge, given its poor accuracy, you are unlikely to receive much mileage out of it. You also miss out on crucial power or recovery that you may get from another item.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Wild Taillow and Swellow (5%)</p>
<p>Receive from Fennel on first visit to Dream World - however, you only get one of the seventeen damage-reducing Berries, and this event cannot be repeated. If you do not receive a Charti Berry in this way, you must trade for it using Share Shelves in the Dream World.</p>
