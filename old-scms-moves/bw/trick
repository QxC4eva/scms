Switches items with the target.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>User exchanges held item with that of the target. Fails if either the user or the target is holding a Mail, if neither is holding an item, or if the user is trying to give or take a Griseous Orb, a Plate, or a Drive to or from a Giratina, an Arceus, or a Genesect, respectively. Pokemon with the ability Sticky Hold are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Trick is an excellent way to cripple all sorts of Pokemon. Slap Trick onto any Choice user that can learn it and you have an ace up your sleeve against troublesome walls; Eviolite users, especially defensive ones such as Chansey and Dusclops, will hate having their precious defense boosts snatched away. Pokemon with Prankster or Klutz can also Trick inconvenient items, such as Lagging Tail and Iron Ball, onto your foe's Pokemon to provide very useful support. This is particularly useful in doubles, where your partner Pokemon can immediately take advantage of what the Trick user has crippled.</p>
