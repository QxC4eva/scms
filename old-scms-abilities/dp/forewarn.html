[SHORT DESC]
Tells which of the opponent's moves has the highest Base Power. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>Alerts the user to the opponent's move that has the highest Base Power when the user switches in. If two moves are of the same Base Power, Forewarn randomly selects one. In Double Battles, Forewarn will only reveal one move total, not one move from each opponent. It selects the highest power move from the two opponents. All moves without a Base Power are assigned a power.</p>
