[SHORT DESC]
Prevents most moves from working on the user that turn.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Protects the user from most moves during the turn. If the user successfully used Detect, Endure, or Protect on the previous turn, Protect only has a 50% chance to work successfully. If the Protect user moves last in a turn, Protect fails.</p>

<p>Feint ends Protect's protection and damages the Protect user. Lock-On, Mind Reader, and No Guard give moves (100 minus accuracy)% chance to hit through Protect. OHKO moves (Horn Drill, Guillotine, Fissure, and Sheer Cold) are always blocked by Protect, even with Lock-On, Mind Reader, or No Guard.</p>

<p>In Diamond and Pearl, but not in Platinum, Thunder has a 30% chance to hit through Protect in the rain, as does Blizzard in hail.</p>

<p>Protect does not protect the user from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acupressure</li>
<li>Curse (used by a Ghost-type)</li>
<li>Doom Desire</li>
<li>Future Sight</li>
<li>Imprison</li>
