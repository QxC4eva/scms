<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Paralyzes the target. Will hit Ghost-types.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Glare is a move that will reliably paralyze any Pokemon. However, it lacks distribution and accuracy, making it an unreliable move. Thunder Wave will generally be a better option unless you face Ground-types, which should be paralyzed with Stun Spore instead.</p>
