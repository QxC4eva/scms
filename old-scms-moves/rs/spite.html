[SHORT DESC]
Lowers the PP of the move used last by 1-5.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Lowers the PP of the last move used by the target by 1-5. Fails if the target has not used a move since it has switched in, if the target tried and failed to use a move this turn (due to Sleep, Paralysis, recharging, etc) before being targeted with Spite, or if the target's last used move already has 0 PP remaining.
