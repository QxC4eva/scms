<div class="speaker dragons"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/pokerap_fuzznip.jpg" alt="grillschomp" /><p>Why are we bothering with pussies like these?<br />
Here, hold my beer, I got children to please<br />
Y'all think you're hotshit with breakthrough immunities?<br />
We're muthafuckin' dragons nigga, not moronic fairies<br />
My crew will rip you apart, the mere sight of us will shatter yo knees<br />
We'll crush you into pixie dust, a new scent for Febreeze<br />
Look at yourself ya fat bitch, do ya live at McD's?<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if ya carried heart disease.</p>

<p>Here, lemme help ya break the ground with my Earthquake<br />
Fire Blast from my boy Salamence, looks like we're having steak<br />
"Hey, I can block your Outrage!" man, gimme a break<br />
Superpower that ho, smash you into a glittered pound cake<br />
Actually, anyone want a Powerpuff milkshake?<br />
Bitch wake up, shall I Double Slap to keep you awake?<br />
Listen closely 'cause I wouldn't want to give you a headache<br />
Just admit that y'all niggas are a mistake.</p></div>

<div class="speaker fairies"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/pokerap_plus.jpg" alt="wiggerlytuff" /><p>Only mistake that we niggas take<br />
Was for whoopin' yo ass six gens too late<br />
The hell is a Goomy? Looks like what yo momma would make<br />
When I created in her V a la V-Create<br />
You kids are a joke like Elite Four Drake<br />
Outrage all ya want little Tyrunt, cause we're first-rate<br />
My Jiggly P. Fraxures yo ass like it was cake<br />
'Cause we Moonblast DBZ-style servin' even Saiyans on a plate.</p>

<p>You can try boosting all ya want via Dragon Dance<br />
Rockin' three Dragonites 'cause you're Champion Lance<br />
We'll still be sleepin', dreamin', perchance<br />
Cause my rap's Shakespeare and yours is overplayed trance<br />
We're the kings of Kalos aka France<br />
My Gardevoir's so sick it'll make ya drop yo pants<br />
So you better go back to Gen 3 with yo Game Boy Advance<br />
Though not even Rayquaza can give ya boys a fighting chance.</p></div>

<div class="speaker dragons"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/pokerap_fuzznip.jpg" alt="grillschomp" /><p>"Thou art as fat as butter," is that what ya desire?<br />
It's hard to handle my raps 'cause they're like barbed wire<br />
Keep huffin' and puffin', ya sound like a kindergarten choir<br />
I'll roast you marshmallows like supa hot fire<br />
Sike that's the wrong numba, you'd best just retire<br />
We still gon' Dragon Dance all up in yo Honey Boo Boo attire<br />
Quit being so Unaware like the dumbfounded Quagsire<br />
We can't wait to wreak the havoc we always did prior.</p>

<p>I mean, Bagon bagged yo momma last night<br />
Tore her up with that Chain Chomp bite<br />
Our own children won't go without a fight<br />
Tell Cosmo and Wanda they need a desperate rewrite<br />
Lemme just give ya some insight and tell you outright<br />
We infest every tier, we don't end with Black and White<br />
Check yo mail 'cause Stephanie Meyer sent you an invite<br />
Looks like you're featured in the next fuckin' Twilight.</p></div>

<div class="speaker fairies"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/pokerap_plus.jpg" alt="wiggerlytuff" /><p>Too bad we're breaking dragons like we're Breaking Dawn<br />
If you fought us in a tournament all you'd do is john<br />
I'll salt yo Goodra more than UU Open specs with a hard on<br />
'Cept I'm not bitchin' cause I'm Togekiss and you're Bagon<br />
I'll paraflinch my way to victory cause we're the champs of Pokemon<br />
Doesn't matter if you're rockin' Flygon, Shelgon, Dra-GONE<br />
Charm and Baby-Doll Eyes swag 'cause looks over brawn<br />
Though I could Jorgen von Strangle yo crew and eat ya like prawns.</p>

<p>Fairy god parents 'cause I'm Timmy Turner bitch<br />
I wish this game had a Specs Meteor switch<br />
Luckily my crew's rockin' the most desired niche<br />
Since you're as overworn as Abercrombie and Fitch<br />
Garchomp, Salamence, doesn't matter which<br />
Most fearsome Pokemon in the game? That's rich<br />
All they're good for is making us a sandwich<br />
And Dragon Clawing my balls 'cause I got a lil' jock itch.</p></div>

<div class="speaker dragons"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/pokerap_fuzznip.jpg" alt="grillschomp" /><p>Goomy pls, I'll serve you a sandwich in the form of my fist<br />
Yo possy is as annoying as Liepard with Assist<br />
We'll megavolve in yo face son, we're impossible to resist<br />
Old faces joining from their much-needed face lift<br />
Ampharos and Charizard now rockin' the best type to exist<br />
Nigga, your ignorance is gettin' me pissed<br />
'Cause ya might think your presence was a long awaited gift<br />
But laugh at us dragons and we'll fuck you up with a twist.</p>

<p>Boy, your fairy tales have been quite the tell<br />
We're still the Captain Hook to your pathetic Tinkerbell<br />
Is it not the Neverland region in which you dwell?<br />
Y'all keep rolling in the deep like the aching Adele<br />
Man you kiddies are more fake than Papa Noel<br />
Ho ho ho muthafuckas, y'all our next clientele<br />
Allow me to finish off with this last farewell<br />
Look out niggas, yo lives will be a living hell.</p></div>

<div class="speaker fairies"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/pokerap_plus.jpg" alt="wiggerlytuff" /><p>Tell Saint Nick that somebody deserves some Torkoal<br />
For spewing crap out yo mouth like it was an asshole<br />
It just bounces off our crew like it was Mega Absol<br />
Togekiss approved dragon counter, 3/3 Quality Control<br />
Got more Dazzling Gleam than a tiara-wearing afrobull<br />
More spice than a Mexican salsa bowl<br />
Spittin' fire hotter than rey talkin' hax en Espanol<br />
We'll flatten ya like tortillas then eat ya whole.</p>

<p>What's Goodra my nigga? It's Togekiss<br />
Punchin' holes in yo team like it was swiss<br />
But apart from all the glamor and glitz<br />
I hit harder than a Blaziken Flare Blitz<br />
Nasty Plot three times and you'd best call it quits<br />
We're more chaos than that guy named Chris<br />
Ignore us while ya still can cause ignorance is bliss<br />
But in the end we still school dragons: class dismissed.</p></div>
