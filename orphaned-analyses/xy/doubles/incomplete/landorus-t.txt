Overview
########
Intimidate helps to weaken the opponent's physical attackers on the field,
high attack, hits very hard especially with powerful stab spread in eq
good offensive typing and coverage, eq + rock slide kills p much everything, also access to U-turn and Knock Off
great defensive typing, only weak to Water and Ice but resists many common types such as Fighting, Bug, Electric, Ground
decent bulk to withstand a few hits
burn is really annoying because Landorus needs its attack

Sitrus Berry can be used to allow greater longevity for Landorus-T, allowing it to survive more hits and thus have more turns to deal damage
Intimidate helps neutralise both physical attackers on the opponent's field and give your teammates greater leeway and reduce damage taken
Jolly Nature helps Landorus to make use of its niche base 91 Speed and outspeed all base 90s and below.

Usage Tips
========
As Landorus-T functions as a great check to physical attackers thanks to its ability Intimidate, take opportunities to switch in on physical attacking opponents in order to cushion both Landorus-T and the partner from their onslaught.
Landorus-T can function well both defensively and offensively thanks to its high Attack as well, so it can be used to retaliate against the opponent with powerful Earthquakes or Rock Slides.
Against a threatening opponent with Ice-type coverage, Landorus-T should switch out into a more favorable teammate so that its Intimidate ability can be preserved
Team Options
========
Flying-types and Levitate mons to avoid Earthquake. togekiss, cresselia thundurus etc are good.
Jirachi is awesome, as it can use follow me to deter burns and Ice type moves, but it is weak to earthquake
anything that's threatened by physical attackers could enjoy having it check them.

Moves

Stone Edge can be used as a concentrated Rock-type attack to deal more damage to a single target as compared to Rock Slide
rock slide is cool spread coverage move with flinch, hits flying types and stuff
Explosion is to be used in a pinch to sacrifice Landorus-T and let it deal major damage to all opponents at the start of the turn.
Knock Off cripples the opponent by removing their item, and also covering Ghost types
Superpower is final coverage move, hits normal types and dark types
Set Details

choice scarf boosts your speed really high while locking you into a move
Intimidate cripples the opponent and gives Landorus-T and its partner quite a bit of cushioning to survive more turns
adamant for maximum power but can use jolly if you want to outrun max speed timid Scarf base 90s
Usage Tips
========
most of the time you will be hitting and running with Intimidate to disrupt the opponent's strategy.
Acts as a great revenge killer to faster threats such as Charizard, Kanghaskhan, Jirachi, Heatran, Excadrill, and more
it can also make a good late-game cleaner
Team Options
========
Speed control is extremely important with this set, Landorus-T should not be on the field while Trick Room is up. A good partner that checks many Trick Room users is Aegislash.
wide guard mons like hitmontop and aegislash, as they stop Blizzard which destroy Landorus-T. wide guard also protects them from lando's eq which is rly cool. Hitmontop has more Intimidate to screw up the opponent while Aegislash has great type synergy

Other Options
########
Band is viable, but Landorus-T has a lack of speed to carry out this role at its full potential, so other users such as Excadrill can perform this role better.
Explosion can bomb the opponent but is highly situational and requires good partner placemnet, not to mention that it kills Landorus-T in the process.
Hidden Power Ice is an option to kill other Landorus-T and is a clutch coverage option against some would-be counters.

On the Physical Attacker set, many other options are available.
Substitute can be used to ease prediction, protect Landorus-T from status effects, and to act as a cushion against faster checks.
Swords Dance or Rock Polish can be used to boost Landorus-T's stats to terrifying levels and sweep the opponent.
Imprison can be interesting to prevent the opponent's usage of the same moves as Landorus-T, for example the common Earthquake and Rock Slide.
Gravity is another interesting option to cripple the opponent's Flying-types and also reduce the evasion of all Pokemon on the field.
Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Despite Landorus-T's great coverage and high attack, some bulky opponents with Ice-type coverage and resist Earthquake can put a dent in Landorus-T's health. Cresselia functions as a dangerous check with its massive bulk being able to take multiple attacks and can retaliate with Icy Wind, which has the added effect of lowering the speed of the Pokemon on your side of the field. Rotom-W has immunity to Earthquake and is not weak to Rock-type attacks, yet can defeat Landorus-T with a Hydro Pump.

**Speed**: Faster Pokemon with an Ice-type attack will be able to defeat Landorus-T. These checks include but are not limited to Deoxys-A, Scarf Kyurem, Kingdra and Ludicolo.

**Speed Control**: Landorus-T dislikes Trick Room, especially the Choice Scarf set, so its partners should try its best to neutralise any Trick Room setters to allow Landorus-T to function at its best

**Utility Moves**: Due to the large amount of usage of spread moves, Landorus-T's strategy is foiled by users of Wide Guard, especially Hitmontop which also has Intimidate to cripple Landorus-T.

**Damage Control**: Burns and Intimidate also reduce the overall effectiveness and damage output of Landorus-T, so care should be taken to prevent these effects from happening onto it.
