Protects user and allies from priority attacks.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user and its party members are protected from attacks with original priority greater than 0 made by other Pokemon, including allies, during this turn. This attack has a 1/X chance of being successful, where X starts at 1 and doubles each time this move is successfully used. X resets to 1 if this attack fails or if the user's last used move is not Detect, Endure, Protect, Quick Guard, or Wide Guard. If X is 256 or more, this move has a 1/(2^32) chance of being successful. Fails if the user moves last this turn or if this move is already in effect for the user's side. This move has a priority of +3.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>A move that only really has any competitive use in double or triple battles. It will protect the user's entire side from all priority attacks, giving enough time for a wall to recover, or an opening space for a frail sweeper to either set up or outright attack. However, to be honest it is usually a waste of time, as you could at the same time just attack, and this move does nothing to non-priority attacks.</p>

<h2>Related Moves</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/moves/protect">Protect</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/detect">Detect</a> are not only viable in non-double or triples formats, but are almost completely superior due to protecting the user from any move.</p>
<p><a href="/bw/moves/wide_guard">Wide Guard also protects the user's entire field, but only works against moves that damage all Pokemon at the same time.</p>
