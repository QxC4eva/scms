<h2>Introduction to the Other Metagames Hub</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Other Metagames hub! This hub is a bit different from the rest of the tier hubs that you may be familiar with; each metagame that gets sufficient popularity will have its own page. In these pages, anything regarding the tier can go there, such as mini threat lists, warstories, and projects. This is the place to be if you're interested in all of the wacky metagames Smogon has to offer. If you want to talk about the different other metagames, join us on the forums or on IRC on #othermetas. If you aren't used to IRC and you want to join us at #othermetas, find out more about IRC <a href="/irc/">here</a>.</p>
