[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that increases the Base Power of all Ice-type moves by 20%. When held by a Pokemon with the Multitype ability, the holder's type will change to Ice.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sadly, Icicle Plate is generally useless even on Arceus as Ice Arceus is usually considered to be the worst Arceus forme. Although having Ice-type STAB is rather useful, it is horrid defensively, and it burdens Arceus with many weaknesses with only one useless resistance, and a weakness to Stealth Rock only seals the deal. Ice Arceus is only any use on hail teams, but even then, it is better to use a different type in most cases.</p>

<p>In addition, most other Ice-types find the power boost from Icicle Plate to be too menial.</p>

<h2>Location</h2> 
<p>Abyssal Ruins, 1F.</p>
