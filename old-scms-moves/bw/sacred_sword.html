<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. This move ignores the target's defensive stat stage changes, including accuracy and evasion modifiers.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sacred Sword, the signature move of the Musketeers, is by no means a bad move, having a respectable 90 Base Power and perfect accuracy. However, Sacred Sword will always be outclassed on offensive versions of the Musketeers by Close Combat, a move with significantly more Base Power. On defensive variants, however, Sacred Sword is a great STAB move to abuse, as it will not lower the user's defensive stats.</p>
