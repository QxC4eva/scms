########
- Threatening Shell Smash sweeper
- Sturdy + Berry Juice combination is very potent for sweeping
- Can function well as a hazard layer much like in BW

SturdyJuice Smash
########
name: SturdyJuice Smash
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: X-Scissor
move 3: Stone Edge / Rock Blast
move 4: Earthquake / Knock Off 
ability: Sturdy 
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

- Shell Smash is what makes Dwebble so threatening, as it makes it very powerful and very fast all in one turn
- X-Scissor is the obligatory STAB attack that deals considerable damage
- Stone Edge is the other STAB attack that is very strong but a bit inaccurate; Rock Blast can be used to override Focus Sash, Sturdy, and to potentially score more damage than Stone Edge, and it is more accurate but the amount of hits it gets per use are totally random
- Knock Off helps with removing items and is more important in that regard than it necessarily is for coverage; Earthquake is an alternative that rounds out coverage decently well with Dwebble's Rock-type STAB attack of choice, and is notably good for nailing Chinchou

Set Details
========

- Berry Juice is the absolute best item option for Dwebble, as Sturdy guarantees a turn of survival in the vast majority of cases, and restores Dwebble to full health even if it with a move that normally knock it out, making Sturdy able to activate a second time in the process
- 15 Speed stat guarantees it to outspeed most Scarfers after a Shell Smash
- Attack is maxed out to provide Dwebble with the highest sweeping ability possible after setting up with Shell Smash

Usage Tips
========

- Dwebble can easily set up with Shell Smash against almost any blunt attacker in the tier; the only things that it has problems with are Fighting-types (mainly due to Knock Off), Steel-types, multi-hit moves (esp Rock Blast), Fake Out (breaks Sturdy), item removal, and the obvious status (burn, para, etc)
- Steel-types are easier to handle if Earthquake is included on the set, but Knock Off can be particularly helpful in breaking down walls better

Team Options
========

- Spritzee and Trubbish make good partners for helping Dwebble beat Fighting-types, as they resist both of Dwebble's STABs and thus can be very problematic. Trubbish can also set up spikes which Dwebble likes.
- Chinchou can help with tanking the Water- and Steel-type attacks aimed at Dwebble, and is particularly useful for keeping Magnemite at bay; Fire- or Fighting-type partners are good for threatening Steel-types as well, particularly Pawniard and Ferroseed
- Dwebble appreciates hazard removal support (Defog or Rapid Spin) if it is to be used in a position other than as a lead, as hazards break its Sturdy and can ruin its SturdyJuice Smash strategy

Hazard Layer
########
name: Hazard Layer
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Spikes
move 3: Rock Blast
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Sturdy 
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

- Stealth Rock breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy on all enemies that don't have Magic Guard, and assists its team with securing KOs
- Spikes is stackable for up to 3 layers and is ideal after Stealth Rock is put down or if the opponent has no Ground immunities, also assists its team with securing KOs
- Rock Blast is the optimal choice as a STAB move for this set, as it discourages setup sweepers, Substitute users, and opposing Sturdy/Focus Sash carriers from setting up on Dwebble
- Knock Off serves the same purpose in a hazard layer set for Dwebble as it did last generation, but is now notably stronger and can actually hurt things, making this move even more viable than it once was on Dwebble's Lead set in BW LC

Set Details
========

- Berry Juice is the absolute best item option for Dwebble for the reasons described in the previous set, although it is used to get more hazards down in this case
- 16 Speed allows Dwebble to outspeed the majority of the tier and speed tie with much of it as well, giving it ample opportunities to get hazards down
-Again, no investment in HP because it needs 21 HP to activate sturdy again.

Usage Tips
========

- A free turn to lay hazards can be gathered by forcing a switch due to the opponent assuming Dwebble is running its SturdyJuice Smash set; this can be bluffed to rack up more hazards and assist more and more with KOs later
-using it as a lead almost guarantees you getting up at least 1 layer of hazards, unless you're facing a taunt user 
- Misdreavus is no longer a safe switch-in now that Knock Off has been buffed
- Try to keep Dwebble far away from Fighting-types, especially ones that run Drain Punch and Knock Off

Team Options
========

- Teammates that can prevent hazard removal are ideal, as they defeat this set's entire purpose; Ghost-types like Misdreavus block Rapid Spin and Prankster Taunt prevents Defog from being used
- Defiant Pawniard makes a good teammate that can severely punish an opposing Defog user for trying to get rid of Dwebble's hazards, allowing Pawniard a hefty +2 Attack on the switch-in
- Water-types - such as chinchou - cover Dwebble's only two weaknesses (Water and Steel) and are ideal partners for tanking those kinds of attacks that might threaten it
- Something to switch into Mienfoo, particularly Taunt variants, is appreciated. Larvesta, and Ponyta can threaten with a burn as it Fake Outs, and Spritzee doesn't care about Taunt.

Other Options
########

- Aerial Ace hits the Fighting-types that wall both of Dwebble's STABs but is decisively on the weak side and is additionally not useful at all outside of that
- Poison Jab is a nice surprise for the Fairy-types that wall Dwebble's X-Scissor, though it's hard to find a moveslot for it
- Rock Slide is an option over Rock Blast that has a more controllable damage range than Rock Blast and has the same accuracy, though Rock Blast is generally a better option
- Flail can be used with Shell Smash and Sturdy to deal insane damage after being taken to 1 HP, but the amount of priority users in the tier make this a bad idea more often than not, and Berry Juice is too good not to use
- Counter can be used to surprise the Fighting-types that normally have little to fear from Dwebble (as well as other physically inclined foes), and can work well with Sturdy, but it's hard to find room on a set for this option

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Scraggy, Mienfoo, Timburr, Meditite, etc (many carry Knock Off also)

**Steel-types**: Pawniard, Magnemite, Ferroseed

**Burn status**: Will-O-Wisp, Scald users

**Prankster paralysis**: Murkrow, Purrloin, especially Cottonee

**Trick/Switcheroo**: Dwebble absolutely hates being deprived of its Berry Juice but it hates even more to have it replaced with a crippling item that renders it useless, such as a Choice item or Flame Orb

**Taunt users**: Taunt users, such as Mienfoo or Misdreavus, can prevent Dwebble using Shell Smash or setting up hazards.
