<h3>Who is Cartoons!?</h3>
<p>My original design on Smogon was to post and run <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=31333">gifbombs</a> with the intention of subverting the youth through violence and stupidities. I'd done gone hooked with CAP and have since directed my efforts to working for the good of the community through art and theological rants.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>The Smog has hosted some of my work, and I've been happy to contribute to CAP and occasionally win the hearts of the people with my <a href="http://cap.smogon.com/web/art/dex/tomohawk_dex.jpg">designs</a>. <a href="http://ivnbvn.com/batcap/">Battle Capacity</a> was born of my zeal for the project.</p>
