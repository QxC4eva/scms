Overview
########
Eelektross boasts a base 115 Attack stat backed up with a base 105 Special Attack stat. Combined with its offensive presence, Eelektross's above-average defenses let it function as an offensive pivot, tanking hits against moderately strong opponents and dishing damage back. Its pure Electric typing and Levitate ability provide it no weakness to any Pokemon type. Unfortunately for Eelektross, its crippling Speed makes it very challenging to use, as it will usually get outsped by most threats in RU, which can either status or KO it.

Moves
========
Thunderbolt is Eelektross’s strongest STAB move, great for KOing Sharpedo, and Yanmega, as well as 2HKOing Alomomola. Alternatively, Volt Switch lets Eelektross pivot to a teammate better-suited for the threat in front of it, but be careful, if the enemy is faster than Eelektross, it might kill Eelektross before it deals enough damage. Flamethrower allows Eelektross to check nasty Grass-, Steel-, and Bug-types such as Escavalier, Durant, and Amoonguss. Giga Drain not only hurts physically defensive Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Dugtrio, but it also gives Eelektross a form of recovery. Knock Off is fantastic for removing opponents' items, particularly Eviolites, Assault Vests, and Life Orbs, items Pokemon such as Doublade, Slowking, and Meloetta use.Acid Spray allows Eelektross to check Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Slurpuff and makes specially defensive enemies more susceptible to special attacks. Volt Switch takes advantage of this drop as no Pokemon is going to want to stay in against Eelektross with -2 Special Defense.

Set Details
========
Eelektross needs to maximize its HP and Special Attack to allow it to pivot around. With a Quiet nature, Eelektross can capitalize on its great Special Attack. An Assault Vest gives Eelektross a big boost in Special Defense, letting it tank hits from the likes of Meloetta and Moltres. Alternatively, an Expert Belt gives Eelektross an opportunity to increase its damage output.
If not running Knock Off, the 4 EVs in Attack can be moved to Special Defense, with a Modest nature.

Usage Tips
========
Eelektross functions as an offensive pivot, switching in and out throughout a match and applying pressure with Volt Switch chip damage and the threat of a strong damaging move. Use Acid Spray to convince your opponent to switch out their Pokemon or take more damage than normal. Should Eelektross suffer from a status confliction, Volt Switch to a cleric such as Aromatisse.To maintain offensive pressure, switch to a sweeper such as Hitmonlee or Doublade. Don't let Eelektross stay in against hard-hitting opponent, especially against Sawk, which threatens Eelektross with Earthquake.


Team Options
========
As an offensive pivot, it’s recommended to have a cleric ready in case Eelektross is damaged or statused. Aromatisse and Lickilicky are great partners for Eelektross because they provide both Wish support and Heal Bell support. Hazard setters are also very useful, as Eelektross will cause opponents to switch in and out repeatedly, getting great residual damage for teammates to sweep on. Rhyperior and Bronzong can set up Stealth Rock while Qwilfish can also set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes and switch out to Eelektross to avoid excessive damage. Rapid Spinners and Defoggers are very useful since Eelektross will be constantly switching in and out around a lot. Hitmontop and Moltres work well, as Hitmontop has Intimidate for weakening opponents and can spin off any hazards, while Moltres is relatively fast, allowing it to eliminate Spikes.

Other Options
########
Eelektross has access to an array of moves, including a deadly physical and special arsenal. Dragon Tail is one of Eelektross’s best options in conjunction with Toxic or entry hazards. Dragon Claw is also great for tackling Druddigon and Tyrantrum. Hidden Power Ice may also be useful for hitting Dragon-types. Flash Cannon can work well with Acid Spray to take out Aromatisse and Whimsicott. Eelektross can also utilize Discharge over Thunderbolt for a higher chance of paralysis in exchange of power. Charge Beam can gradually increase Eelektross's Special Attack. If Eelektross wishes to set up, it can also use Coil to buff its Attack, Defense, and some more powerful moves' shaky Accuracy, enabling it to use Rock Slide and Zap Cannon. Eelektross can also utilize Drain Punch for recovery or Aqua Tail, which can help against pesky Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Dugtrio, with Coil to become a setup sweeper. Eelektross has a variety of options in terms of item selection. It can run Choice Specs or Choice Band to hit like a missile, or a Life Orb in order to avoid being locked into a move at the cost of some of its health. Eelektross can run Leftovers as well in order to recover HP, which can help tremendously, considering its limited recovery.

Eelektross can also opt to run a physically offensive Assault Vest set with an Adamant nature. This would use Thunder Punch as a STAB move, U-turn as an alternative to Volt Switch, which can be blocked by Ground-types, Knock Off to take out Eviolites and Life Orbs, and Drain Punch to help it recover. Aqua Tail could be used over Drain Punch to take out pesky Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Dugtrio. With an Adamant nature spiking its Attack stat, Eelektross can become a strong physically offensive pivot.

Checks & Counters
########

**Hard Hitting Choice Band Users**: Emboar is strong enough to 2HKO Eelektross with Flare Blitz, leaving it severely damaged or knocked out. Escavalier can also cause it trouble thanks to its typing and high Attack.

**Druddigon**: Druddigon resists Electric-type attacks and can ruin setup sweeps with Dragon Tail. It also has great defenses, allowing it to take a hit and get rid of Eelektross if it becomes a major threat.

**Aromatisse**: Aromatisse is a strong wall that can take both physical and special attacks. It can tank a few special hits and inflict status on Eelektross. Aromatisse also resists moves such as Drain Punch and Knock Off and is immune to Dragon Tail. Aromatisse can stall Eelektross out with Toxic and pass Wishes to teammates as well.

**Status**: Thanks to its typing, Eelektross is immune to paralysis, however, status inflictions like burn or toxic are extremely detrimental to Eelektross. Burn damage causes Eelektross to lose its physical strength, making setup pointless. Toxic can slowly KO Eelektross, shortening its longevity.
