<p>It's been an interesting six weeks for Pokemon in general, both OU and UU. Testing has revved up again for both tiers, with Stage 3-2 of Suspect Testing bringing Latias, Manaphy, and Garchomp back to the table, and UU dropping a whole bevy of banned Pokemon back down from BL to UU for a second chance.</p>

<h3>Stage 3.2</h3>

<p>With the recent implementation of the Supermajority rule for testing, the Suspect Test has returned to OU for another pass. While Latios and Shaymin-S received definitive votes (around 70% each), Garchomp, Latias, and Manaphy returned to the Suspect Ladder for another testing period. With the voting completing soon, we'll get to see if Stage 3-3 is happening, and if so, which of the suspects will be returning for another round.</p>

<h3>The UU Test</h3>

<p>UU went through some major changes this time around. Yanmega found itself booted from the tier with a rare unanimous vote. The aforementioned Supermajority rule has caused former BL Pokemon Raikou, Gallade, and Froslass to return to UU. In addition, Rhyperior and Alakazam found a new home in UU, seemingly replacing old standards Rhydon and Espeon. With Suspect nominations right around the bend, stay tuned to see what's happening in the tier!</p>
