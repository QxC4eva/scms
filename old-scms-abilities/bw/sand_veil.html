Evasion increases by 25% in a sandstorm.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If sandstorm is the prevailing weather condition, the wielder gets a 25% evasion increase. In addition, if a non-Ground-, Rock-, or Steel-type Pokemon has this ability, it will not take damage from sandstorm.</p>

<p>Sand Veil decreases the wild Pokemon encounter rate in areas with sandstorm by 50%.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sand Veil is a very, very annoying ability that has generated a lot of hate in the past due to the fact that it was so easy to abuse. Even so, while you used to be able to see the occasional <a href="/bw/pokemon/gliscor">Gliscor</a> with it, it usually prefers <a href="/bw/abilities/poison_heal">Poison Heal</a>. No other users will be seen with it, apart from the occasional <a href="/bw/pokemon/cacturne">Cacturne</a>, whom players use purely to annoy you. Thanks to the very high chance of avoiding an attack under sandstorm—a prevalent weather condition in most of Smogon's higher metagames—it is a very good ability indeed.</p>

<p>On October 15th 2012, Sand Veil was <a href="/forums/showpost.php?p=4428479&postcount=83">voted to be banned</a> from Smogon's OU metagame as well as all tiers below it, so is currently unusable in all Smogon metagames bar Ubers and Little Cup.</p>
