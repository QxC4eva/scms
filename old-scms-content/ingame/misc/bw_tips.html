<h2><a name="tipstricks">Basic Tips and Tricks</a></h2>

<h3><a name="hmslaves">HM Slave</a></h3>
<p>In Pokemon Black and White, Cut is the only HM move required to complete the main storyline, and even then it does not require frequent use. However, many items and side-quests may require you to use the HMs Strength, Surf, Dive and Waterfall. HM Fly is useful as it allows you to instantly return to towns you have previously visited.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/595.png" alt="Carracosta" /><br />
Carracosta learns four out of the six HMs: Surf, Dive, Waterfall, and Strength. It can be found relatively early in-game as a fossil in the Desert Resort.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/531.png" alt="Samurott" /><br />
Samurott has access to Cut, Strength, Waterfall, Dive, and Surf and can be obtained very early being a starter Pokémon. However, this forces you to start with Oshawott.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/622.png" alt="Frillish" /><br />
Frillish learns Surf, Waterfall, Dive, and the TM Flash, which is useful for exploring Wellspring Cave and Challenger's Cave.  It can also be obtained relatively early in the game.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/578.png" alt="Basculin" /><br />
Basculin learns Surf, Dive, Waterfall and Cut and can be found on almost every water area in the game.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/611.png" alt="Swanna" /><br />
Swanna gets Fly, Dive and Surf. You can find it in Swirling Dust spots on the Marvelous Bridge.</p>

<h3><a name="money">Fast Money</a></h3>
<p>There are many ways to quickly become a millionaire in-game. If you are going the tried-and-tested route by grinding on trainer battles all day long, don't leave home without the Amulet Coin; this highly useful hold item is found in Castelia City after defeating the dancers at the fountain. If your Pokemon holds it while battling, you get twice the prize money for winning. This can be used as an effective strategy by battling certain trainers again and again. Some common methods to gain money quickly are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Abyssal Ruins – The Abyssal Ruins contain just one side-quest. You can find all of the 16 elemental plates and some ancient items here. These relic items can be sold to the Relic Maniac in the "Riches" Villa in Undella Town.  Do note that this area has a step limit.</li>
<li>The Riches – The Riches in Undella Town are a great source of money. You start off battling one person, and every day you fight the same person plus one more member.  You can battle six people at most to get an enormous amount of money, especially if your lead is holding an Amulet Coin.</li>
<li>Stadiums – In Nimbasa City, there are two stadiums, namely the Big Stadium and the Small Court. These can be accessed quite early in the game. Trainers can be battled daily, except for some event hours. They provide a good amount of money, especially when coupled with the Amulet Coin.</li>
<li>Other trainer battles – Several trainers give out loads of experience and money, and they can be battled once a week, or even daily! A few of them are:
<ul>
<li>Ferris Wheel Battle – In Nimbasa City, every now and then a trainer will appear in front of the Ferris Wheel in the amusement park. You can ride on the Ferris Wheel after defeating them.</li>
<li>Cynthia Battle – You can battle her everyday in her house in the Undella Bay, in the months of Spring.</li>
<li>Morimoto Battle – You can battle a trainer based on GameFreak employee Shigeki Morimoto in the GameFreak building in Castelia City. You can battle him all seasons.</li>
<li>Opelucid City Battles – In a house near the Route 10 exit, there are two trainers who will battle you everyday. It can either be a Rotational Battle or a Triple Battle depending on your game version.</li>
<li>Cheren – You can battle Cheren everyday at the seventh floor of Victory Road.</li>
<li>Bianca – You can battle Bianca every Saturday night in Professor Juniper's Lab.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="gift">Gift Pokemon</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Elemental Trio – An NPC in the Dream Yard will give you a Pansage, Pansear or Panpour depending upon the starter.</li>
<li>Zorua – Found in a building in Castelia City, if the Movie Celebi has been transferred with the Relocator.</li>
<li>Larvesta Egg – Given by an NPC in a house in Route 18.</li>
<li>Archen / Tirtouga / Fossils in general - Revive the corresponding fossil in the Nacrene Museum.</li>
<li>Magikarp - Not technically a gift, but you can purchase a Magikarp in Marvelous Bridge for $500. It should be noted that this is the only way to get Magikarp in-game apart from the Dream World or transferring.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="special">Special Pokemon</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Musharna – After defeating the Elite Four, a Telepathy Musharna is found in the Abandoned Lot of Dreams every Friday.</li>
<li>Volcarona – A Volcarona can be found in the basement of the Relic Castle after defeating the Elite Four.</li>
<li>Darmanitan – Some Zen Mode Darmanitan can be found outside the Relic Castle. You'll need a RageCandyBar to battle them.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="daily">Daily Events</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Swarms – After receiving the National Dex, each midnight, a Pokemon is chosen as a swarm Pokemon in a particular route. These Pokemon are usually not found in Unova. To see what route a swarm is happening, go to the gates situated between two cities and check your Dex.</li>
<li>Pinwheel Forest Rock – In Pinwheel Forest, there is a stone in the south-eastern part. Taking a Fighting-type Pokemon there will allow you to interact with the rock. It gives you a Star Piece. This Star Piece can be sold for $4900 to regular Poke Marts, or for $9800 to a man in Icirrus City Pokemon Center.</li>
<li>Ingredients Lady in Route 5 - You can sell any food items to the maid inside the trailer found in Route 5. The prices at which she buys items is:<br />
Item Name Selling Price<br />
Big Mushroom $5000<br />
BalmMushroom $25000<br />
Castelia Cone $2000<br />
Leftovers $200<br />
Lucky Egg $200<br />
Old Gateau $4000<br />
Rare Candy$10000<br />
Shoal Salt $7000<br />
TinyMushroom $500</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="extra">Extra Items Via Trading</a></h3>
<p>In Castelia City, an NPC located on the top floor of the Pokemon Center will give you items based upon the number of trades you’ve made. However, each item can be obtained only once from him.</p>

<p>Items:<br />
Wide Lens – 5<br />
Everstone – 10<br />
Zoom Lens – 20<br />
Choice Scarf – 30<br />
PP Max – 40<br />
Master Ball – 50</p>

<h3><a name="breeding">Breeding</a></h3>
<p>You can improve the results of your breeding by utilizing a few tricks. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Power Items and the Everstone to their complete extent. They help you pass good IVs and the parent's nature to the offspring.</li>
<li>Have a Pokemon with Flame Body or Magma Armor as an ability in your party. Both halve the amount of steps required to hatch an egg.</li>
<li>Try hatching Eggs in long places like the Skyarrow Bridge. It makes it easier to obtain the amount of steps required to hatch the egg.</li>
<li>Carry 5 Eggs at once in your party. This reduces the time it takes to hatch many eggs.</li>
<li>Smeargle is an excellent parent for Pokemon in the Field Egg group. It can pass down any egg move combination by using its signature move Sketch in double battles. You can easily get into a double battle on demand in routes such as Route 3. If your Smeargle is faster than your other Pokemon, have the slower Pokemon use the move you want Sketched on your Smeargle on the first turn. Use Sketch the next turn, and voila, your Smeargle has the move you wish to pass down!</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="characteristics">Characteristics</a></h3>
<p>Characteristics were introduced in the fourth generation. They are viewable on the trainer memo page of the Pokemon's summary, and the message seen is determined by the Pokemon's highest IV. This can be used as a method of identifying a probable IV value in a given stat, but is best combined with other methods of checking IVs, such as the IV judge and the Hidden Power man.</p>

<h3><a name="evreduce">EV Reducing Berries</a></h3>
<p>The EV Reducing Berries are perhaps the most useful Berries outside of  those used in battle. They are ideal for correcting mistakes during  EVing, or clearing a Pokemon of 'random' EVs gained during a  play-through. Essentially, these Berries work as the reverse of  vitamins, removing 10 EVs at a time. However, you can use as many  Berries as you wish in a particular stat.</p>

<h3><a name="wings">Wings</a></h3>
<p>Wings allow you to increase the EVs of your Pokemon in a specific stat  by one point. Unlike standard Vitamins, these can be used even after  reaching 100 EVs for a certain stat. They will not work after reaching  255 EVs, though.</p>

<p>The Health Wing raises a Pokemon's HP EVs.<br />
The Muscle Wing raises a Pokemon's Attack EVs.<br />
The Resist Wing raises a Pokemon's Defence EVs.<br />
The Genius Wing raises a Pokemon's Sp. Attack EVs.<br />
The Clever Wing raises a Pokemon's Sp.Def EVs.<br />
The Swift Wing raises a Pokemon's Speed EVs</p>

<h3><a name="audino">Audino Grinding</a></h3>
<p>Wild Audino can be found in shaking spots in the grass throughout Unova  on both Black and White. They provide enormous amounts of experience,  especially with a Lucky Egg. </p>

<h3><a name="entralink">Entralink</a></h3>
<p>The Entralink is situated in the center of Unova. Pokemon transferred  from the Dream World appear in the Entree Forest there. This special  place also gives you access to special powers called Entree Powers. </p>

<h3><a name="pass">Pass Power and Pass Orbs</a></h3>
<p>The Entralink is situated in the center of Unova. Pokemon transferred  from the Dream World appear in the Entree Forest there. This special  place also gives you access to special powers called Entree Powers. </p>

<li>"It can't be better in that regard." – IV: 31</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If the Pokemon has 31 IVs in more than one stat, the IV judge will tell you the stats that have 31 IVs followed by:<br />
"It can't be better in that regard."</p>

<h3><a name="hp">Hidden Power Man</a></h3>
<p>In Mistralton City a man next to the Pokemon Center Nurse will tell you  the type of your Pokemon's Hidden Power. However, if the Pokemon doesn't  learn Hidden Power, he won't tell you the Hidden Power type.</p>

<h3><a name="battle">The Battle Institute</a></h3>
<p>Next to the Pokemon Center in Nimbasa City, there is a Battle Institute.  It can help you check your Pokemon's IVs as it levels them to level 50  automatically. Using it along with the IV judge and the Hidden Power man  can help you to get exact IVs using an IV calculator.</p>

<h3><a name="ev">EV Checker</a></h3>
<p>The EV Checker can be found on the first floor of a small house located  north of the Opelucid City Pokemon Center. Depending on the number of  EVs your lead Pokemon has gained, she gives you one of two messages:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Your &lt;Pokemon&gt;...<br />
looks like it can try a little harder." – 0-509 EVs</li>
<li>"Your &lt;Pokemon&gt;...<br />
 has put in a great effort!" –  510 EVs</li>
</ul>

<p>However, note that she no longer gives out an Effort Ribbon.</p>
