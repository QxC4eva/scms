[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder attacks a Pokemon with a contact move, there is a 30% chance of the target becoming poisoned. Poison Touch is considered a secondary effect for the purposes of <a href="/bw/abilities/shield_dust">Shield Dust</a> and is prevented by <a href="/bw/moves/safeguard">Safeguard</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Can be useful for <a href="/bw/pokemon/muk">Muk</a>, but <a href="/bw/pokemon/seismitoad">Seismitoad</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/toxicroak">Toxicroak</a> have better options. Low effect chance makes it very shaky, and the effect is only regular poison as opposed to Toxic poison, making Poison Touch an inferior choice of ability.</p>
