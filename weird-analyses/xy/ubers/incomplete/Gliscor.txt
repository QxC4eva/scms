    ########
    In a metagame with status moves being in almost every team, Gliscor's Poison Heal is a given. Thanks to its good physical bulk and a very good typing, Gliscor is also one of the best check to threatening physical sweepers such as Zekrom and Groudon.


    Stealth Rock setter

    name: Stealth Rock setter
    move 1: Stealth Rock
    move 2: Taunt
    move 3: Toxic
    move 4: Earthquake
    ability: Poison Heal
    item: Toxic Orb
    evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4SpD
    nature: Impish

    Moves
    ========
    Gliscor is one of the best Stealth Rock setter in the 6th generation. It will find many opportunities to use this move thanks to its natural status sponging ability and excellent physical bulk. Taunt is very important with this set : this prevent some defoggers, namely Giratina, Scizor and Skarmory to remove the precious rocks. Toxic, make Gliscor one of the best stallbreaker in the game, as the opponent won't be able to cure the poison or recover lost health thanks to Taunt and won't be able to status Gliscor thanks to Poison Heal. Most stallers are slower than uninvested Gliscor's 95 speed base stat, so you'll be able to Taunt them repeatedly. Earthquake rounds out the set perfectly, as it will hurt most steel-type and poison-type Pokémon which are immune to Toxic. Even if uninvested Gliscor's attack is underwhelming, the damage output is decent thanks to STAB.

    Set Details
    ========
    The listed EVs and nature grants Gliscor the best physical bulk possible, which allow it to check threatening physical sweepers such as Zekrom, Groudon, Mega Mewtwo X and some Ho-oh sets. Toxic Orb is a must as it helps Gliscor to activate Poison Heal.

    This set face competition with Landorus-T's similar set, which has the same typing, similar bulk (if you take in account Intimidate and Poison Heal), but Gliscor is also a stallbreaker and status absorber, which make him the superior option as a Stealth Rock setter if your team need such roles.

    Usage Tips
    ========
    Gliscor should come in as soon as possible to set up Stealth Rock. Gliscor usually have many switch in opportunities, primarily against many physical sweepers and a lot of stallers or status abusers.

    Taunt should be used first against opponents able to set up hazards or Defog your own hazards.

    Against a support Pokémon which can't do anything against Gliscor, it's often a good idea to use Toxic on a predicted switch in.

    As you don't have Roost, you can be destroyed by repeated physical moves. For this reason, don't hesitate to use Earthquake so that you don't take too many attacks from a poisonned offensive foe.

    Team Options
    ========
    When using Gliscor, you should have partners able to handle the special sweepers which would generally switch in against it. Palkia is a very good partner, as it is one of the best Kyogre check. You should also have a solid Xerneas and Palkia check. Aegislash is a very good partner as it handle Xerneas and many special sweepers, while Aegislash like partners with ground immunity.
