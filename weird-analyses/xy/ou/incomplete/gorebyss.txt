    ########

        Access to one of the best boosting moves in the game, Shell Smash, along with the ability to Baton Pass these boosts to a teammate.
        Decent base 114 Special Attack allowing it to use the Shell Smash boosts itself.
        55/105/75 defenses along with it's pure Water-typing allows it to take common priority moves such as Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet.
        It is fairly slow and even after a boost and can be exposed by various revenge killers such as Rotom-W and Genesect.

    Moves
    ========

        Shell Smash is a powerful boosting move that any sweeper would love to have. It's the focal point of the set boosting Attack, Special Attack and Speed by +2 while decreasing defenses by -1.
        Baton Pass is what makes this set so dangerous allowing it to pass the boosts off to a powerful sweeper.
        Hydro Pump is a powerful STAB move serving as a nuke with the Shell Smash boost even without investment.
        Surf is a 100% accurate STAB move at the cost of reduced power as opposed to Hydro Pump
        Ice Beam is a coverage option allowing it to hit Grass-types such as Chesnaught, Celebi, and Mega-Venusaur hard.
        Substitute is a great move allowing Gorebyss and the receiver the ability to block harmful status although the nerf to Substitute makes this option less feasible.
        Ice Beam allows Gorebyss to smash Dragons such as Noivern, Garchomp, and Salamence to name a few.


    Set Details
    ========

        168 Spe EVs allows Gorebyss to outspeed +Base 115s such as Starmie after a boost.
        Rest of the EVs are put into HP with 88 EVs going into SpD allowing Gorebyss to always survive a +1 Genesect's Thunderbolt at full health.
        White Herb allows Gorebyss to remove the stat drops from Shell Smash while Lum Berry removes crippling status such as paralysis which makes Gorebyss' job of passing a lot harder.


    Usage Tips
    ========

        Gorebyss should come in on a wall that cannot threaten it such as Blissey although it should be wary of Thunder Wave if not using Lum Berry and proceed to Shell Smash. It should then pass the boosts to a sweeper.
        If nothing is able to stomach it's STAB move of choice or Ice Beam then Gorebyss should proceed to sweep.


    Team Options
    ========

        Teammates who appreciate Shell Smash boosts should be partnered with Gorebyss; Mega-Lucario, Mega-Garchomp, and Aegislash pair up well.
        Partners such as Heatran who can remove speedy, powerful threats such as Scarf Genesect partner up well with Gorebyss.



    Shell Smash Sweeper
    ########
    name: Shell Smash Sweeper
    move 1: Shell Smash
    move 2: Hydro Pump / Surf
    move 3: Ice Beam
    move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Fire
    ability: Swift Swim
    item: White Herb / Life Orb / Lum Berry
    EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
    nature: Modest

    Moves
    ========

        Shell Smash is the most important move on Gorebyss turning it into a frightening sweeper.
        Hydro Pump serves as a powerful STAB move although it's accuracy may be unappealing.
        Surf is a reliable option if the imperfect accuracy of Hydro Pump is unappealing.
        Hidden Power Grass is Gorebyss' best attack against bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Vaporeon.
        Hidden Power Fire allows Gorebyss to crush Pokemon that have a 4x weakness to it such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Forretress.

    Set Details
    ========

        Max Special Attack EVs to hit as hard as it can while the rest are poured into Speed.
        White Herb allows it to get rid of those defense drops allowing Gorebyss to take priority attacks easier.
        Life Orb allows Gorebyss to hit hard at the cost of survivability.
        Lum Berry allows Gorebyss to rid itself of crippling status such as Paralysis.


    Usage Tips
    ========

        Gorebyss should come in on something that cannot threaten it such as Heatran and Shell Smash. Beware of predicted Roar, especially if packing White Herb as not only will the boosts be phazed away but essentially the item as well.


    Team Options
    ========

        Teammates who can lure in special walls and KO them such as Tornadus-T are good teammates. Tornadus-T can lure in the pink blobs, and smash them with Superpower.
        Politoed is a great partner as it brings Drizzle which not only powers up Gorebyss STAB move of choice, but also complements Gorebyss' abilities as well.
