<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals holder 1/8 of damage dealt.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While Shell Bell may seem like a good item in theory, one must take into account just how outclassed this item is. For instance, the recovery Shell Bell provides is considerably less desirable than the recovery <a href="/dp/items/leftovers">Leftovers</a> provides; while Shell Bell's recovery only occurs when the Pokemon holding it attacks and the amount of HP healed is variable, Leftovers provides recovery of 1/16 of the holder's total HP every turn, making it a superior option. It fails to help boost sweepers' power, help defensively, or provide any other service one would hope to get from an item. Shell Bell should never be used as a held item, simply because its effect is too gimmicky.</p>
