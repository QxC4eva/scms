[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Special Defense by one stage. If the user chooses to use an Electric-type attack on the next turn, its power will be doubled.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Generally, Charge is not an especially effective move. Though the Special Defense boost may be somewhat useful, an Electric-type attack on the following turn will be telegraphed and can be easily dealt with in a variety of ways. Generally, if applicable, it is best to use a move such as Calm Mind to boost both offensively and defensively, rather than restricting the offensive boost to one attacking type on one turn.</p>
