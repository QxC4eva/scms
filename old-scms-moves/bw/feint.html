Nullifies effect of Detect and Protect.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of +2. Ignores the effect of Protect or Detect. In doubles and triples, it removes the effect of these moves for the rest of the turn, allowing teammates to attack the opponent using Protect or Detect. Will also remove the effects of Quick Guard or Wide Guard used by the target. Feint cannot be called upon by Mirror Move, Assist, or Metronome.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Feint is mostly still useless in most singles metagames, but it can come in handy in VGC play, as it not only hits through Protect, but also exposes the opposing Pokemon to your partner's attacks. A timely Feint on a predictable Protect along with a powerful attack from your partner Pokemon can turn around a match completely. Good users to consider include Pokemon that wield Fake Out, such as Hitmontop, Sableye, and Infernape, as they make Protect all the more predictable.</p>
