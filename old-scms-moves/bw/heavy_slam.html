<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Heavy Slam has little to no competitive use. Unless used by exceptionally heavy Pokemon on extremely light targets, the move will often be outdamaged by more reliable choices, such as Iron Head or Meteor Mash. The exception to this is Choice Band Aggron in RU, where Heavy Slam gets a stronger hit on many of the Pokemon that threaten Aggron more than Iron Head.</p>
