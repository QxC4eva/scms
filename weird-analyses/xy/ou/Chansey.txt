Overview
########
- Chansey is the best special wall in OU. Higher bulk in every way makes it even outclass Blissey.
- It is an obligatory member of stall, as it is the only Pokemon able to take Draco Meteors, sun-boosted Fire Blasts from Mega Charizard Y, etc. consistently throughout the battle.
- Good physical bulk with Eviolite, too, allowing it to function as a sort of mixed wall.
- An amazing support movepool lets it act as a cleric, Wish passer, or even set up Stealth Rock.
- It is easily stopped by Taunt and broken through by powerful physical attackers.
- Knock Off cripples it.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Soft-Boiled
move 2: Heal Bell / Stealth Rock
move 3: Toxic / Thunder Wave
move 4: Seismic Toss
ability: Natural Cure
item: Eviolite
evs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

- Soft-Boiled provides reliable recovery to keep healthy throughout the match.
- Heal Bell if cleric support is desired, or Stealth Rock because Chansey can pretty much always set it up due to walling so many special threats.
- Toxic is its main form of damage output, wearing down walls and offensive Pokemon alike.
- Thunder Wave cripples speedy offensive Pokemon that attempt to break through Chansey.
- Seismic Toss is used so it isn't Taunt fodder, can wear down Toxic'd Pokemon faster, and can damage Pokemon immune to Toxic.
- Counter is a solid option to take out physical attackers attempting to break through Chansey.

Set Details
========

- The EVs give it good physical bulk with Eviolite and add to its immense special bulk.
- Natural Cure lets it function as a great status absorber.

Usage Tips
========

- Switch this in to handle special attackers like Mega Charizard Y and Latios (just make sure it isn't Specs first).
- Avoid potential Knock Off users at all costs.
- If you run Heal Bell, use it sparingly, as it only has 8 PP.
- Against offensive Pokemon, the first move should always be Toxic assuming Chansey has it. Or else, just go for Thunder Wave.
- Don't attempt to use Chansey as sleep fodder. Intelligent foes will just use the sleep move against as you switch it out.

Team Options
========

- Walls to handle common physical attacking titans (especially Fighting-types), such as Skarmory, Quagsire, and Hippowdon, are necessary because Chansey is easily overwhelmed them.
- Mega Venusaur is also very good on stall, and can absorb Knock Offs and Tricks for Chansey, as well as counter Keldeo.

Wish
########
name: Wish
move 1: Wish
move 2: Soft-Boiled / Protect
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Seismic Toss
ability: Natural Cure
item: Eviolite
evs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

- Wish lets Chansey keep its teammates healthy. Thanks to its enormous HP stat, its Wishes are almost overkill for many Pokemon.
- Soft-Boiled provides immediate recovery
- Protect is also an option to scout and turn Wish into reliable recovery, generally easing prediction; however, it is essentially an invitation for foes to set up on Chansey.
- Toxic is Chansey's main form of damage, and should be its go-to move against non-immune Pokemon that aren't very threatening to it.
- Seismic Toss ensures it isn't total Taunt fodder and speeds up the process of wearing down foes greatly.

Set Details
========

- The EVs give it good physical bulk with Eviolite and add to its immense special bulk.
- Natural Cure lets it function as a great status absorber.

Usage Tips
========

- It's the same old Chansey&mdash;switch it into special attackers, as it walls pretty much all of them.
- Always prioritize Chansey's health. If it's weakened, used Soft-Boiled before anything else.
- So long as Chansey is healthy enough, Wish can be used to heal a weakened teammate.
- When recovery is not a priority, Toxic against non-immune foes to start wearing them down. Start spamming Seismic Toss and recover as needed from there, or switch out to a more appropriate answer to the foe, if applicable.
- Avoid Knock Off.


Team Options
========

- Walls to handle common physical attacking titans (especially Fighting-types), such as Skarmory, Quagsire, and Hippowdon, are necessary because Chansey is easily overwhelmed them.
- Mega Venusaur is also very good on stall, and can absorb Knock Offs and Tricks for Chansey, as well as counter Keldeo.
- Teammates without reliable recovery particularly enjoy this Chansey's support.

Other Options
########
- Skill Swap can be used to combat Poison Heal Gliscor, but doesn't have much use outside of that except for the incredibly rare Calm Mind Reuniclus.
- Gravity can be used to support Pokemon such as Landorus and Landorus-T looking to take advantage of that, but those Pokemon are generally better off using the move themselves.
- Sing, though it has crappy accuracy, can be used to put a Pokemon to sleep.

Checks and Counters
########

**Fighting-type attacks**: In general, Pokemon such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Aegislash, and mixed Thundurus are very threatening to Chansey with the Fighting-type attacks they carry.

**Powerful physical attackers**: This includes Pokemon like Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Gyarados, which are able to break right through Chansey.

**Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo**: Catching Chansey with a Knock Off from a Pokemon such as Thundurus or Life Orb Deoxys-S cripples it, eliminating its decent physical bulk and overall lowering its defensive use greatly. A Trick or Switcheroo from a Pokemon such as Choice Specs Latios also achieves the same goal, though its user will not appreciate the loss of item.
