[title]Newark 1st time VGC warstory[/title]

So this was my 1st vgc tournament and it had me so nervous for the whole tourney.  I wore a coldplay shirt and had a nintendo world bag if anybody recognizes that. After 4 hours of sleep and a 4 1/2 hour car ride i finally made it to the expo center to stand in line for the next 3 hours.

My Team:
Abomasnow-Quiet @ chesto berry
Blizzard, Grass Knot, Ice Shard, Protect

Palkia- Timid @ lustrous orb
Spacial Rend, Blizzard, Earth Power, Protect

Giratina-Jolly @ choice scarf
shadow force, shadow claw, dragon claw, earth power

Tyranitar- Adament @ leftovers
Earthquake, Crunch, Stone Edge, Protect

I started making this team the day before the tournament. I finished palkia and giratina in the car ride and finished abomasnow while standing in line. I did not finish my 4th member so just took a pokemon already had ready for singles and put protect on it. Now on to the tournament.

r1- Feraligator, Heatran, Dusclops, Mewtwo
Guy led Feraligator and Heatran which i just destroyed, would have escaped without lossing a poke but he got a crit in.

r2- Palkia, Smeargle, Parasect, ???
up against a palkia and smeargle lead that had me a little scared but this is y i had a chesto berry on abomasnow to counter this and took out the smeargle with one blizzard

r3-cant remember the first 3 pokemon, but i remember his blissey which almost knocked me out. My ttar was burned and giratina was stuck on shadow claw but i killed it due to crunch lowering his defence 3-4 times.

r4- Groudon, Shiftry, Zapdos(not sure), Ho-oh

im the one on the right standing up
as soon as i saw shiftry and groudon come out i pretty much knew i had won. she was a good player but my team was an almost perfect counter for hers.

im the one sitting in the chair and u can also c chalkey in the team magma shirt and pocketcat in the blue shirt
So I'm in the finalist and cant believe it for my 1st tourney. I talk some ppl for a bit and then go out for some lunch and then return for the finals.

I was unlucky and did not get a bye so i now had to play 2 more rounds just to make top 16, which did not have me thrilled.

top64-

me waiting for them to finish the countdown
the guy led zapdos and electivire, which i thought it was interesting that he made it this far with that lead. cant remember rest of match.

top32- by this point my memory is getting fuzzy due to lack of sleep and only remember that after I won i congratulated the guy on getting this far with only one legendary which was rayquaza.

top16- cant believe i made it this far and still cant remember this match besides the fact that i won.

top8-

one more win and i get $300 travel money and a dsi. since the guy made it this far and i dont know if he wants to keep  his team to be kept secret or not i will not mention his team. but the match ended with me making some mistakes and forgetting moves on some pokemon but even if i had of played at my best i still doubt whether i could have won, he was pretty,good. guys name was chalkey.  

All in all I had a great time and met some people but wish i had talked to more. still cant believe i made top8 and got an inv to nationals. As of right now i will not be attending though, due to lack of transportation, will c if i can work something out but its not looking good.

heres a picture of pikachu just for the hell of it
