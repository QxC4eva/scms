<p>Smogon is a constantly growing and changing community. A lot of things  will  be changing in Smogon in the coming months, including things that  our  readers might not be aware of until they come. You may have noticed  a  few new administrators in our midst these days, both returned from  the darkness of retirement to guide Smogon once more into the future.  What I can tell you about them is that they were chosen to help with  Smogon's vision and keep it on track moving deeper into the fifth  generation. Just keep your hard hats on as Smogon keeps trekking along;  the process may send us over a lot of bumps, but we'll eventually get  there safe and sound.</p>

<p>Speaking of changes, if you look on the main site, we finally have the <a href="/bw/pokemon/">BW Poke Dex</a> implemented! All of our Site Staff will be super busy, so if you find   yourself without a head during the next few days after PMing them,  don't  say we didn't warn you!</p>

<p>Our VGC community has been busy working away the summer  months and  we've come to the end of the line. BlueCookies is someone you might  remember from last year's VGC series, where he finished number one in  the world. Well, for the first time ever, VGC has seen a repeat, or  should I say Ray-peat! He won the masters title yet again in 2011!  Another Smogonite, kamz, took the senior division as well. You could say  that Smogon went to town on VGC this year. (Did I mention that the  masters second place finisher, Matty85, is also a Smogonite?)</p>

<p>Since our last issue, a few of our official tournaments have ended on  top of the VGC championship. The Smogon Tour ended with Golden Sun  taking home the trophy, and  the Smogon Frontier ended with Bloo coming  out ahead with a 12-1 record.  Next up was Tyler, who came up from down  under to take home the gold in  Smogon's official VGC tournament. If you  haven't already, you should probably spam their walls with visitor  messages offering congratulations!</p>

<p>Other than all of that, Smogon is as Smogon was. We at The Smog are   focusing a lot on competitive ventures for this article. We've got   descriptions of the newly implemented RU (rarelyused) by Oglemi, coverage of UU and OU by Oglemi and elDino, respectively, and some  philosophical competitive discussions like Eternal's article on whether  OU needs weather at all. Oh, and in case you think we haven't thought   about writing for your own personal amusement, you should go check out   articles like MoP's musings! I hope you enjoy this issue as much as we   enjoyed putting it together, and look forward to working on many more  issues in the future.</p>

<p>Happy Reading!</p>
