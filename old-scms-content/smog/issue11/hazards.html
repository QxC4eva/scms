 <p>None can deny that entry hazards play a huge role in the OU  metagame. How do you use them to your advantage, though? Each of the  three entry hazards has their own effects with unique advantages over  those of other hazards. You also have many options when it comes to  putting the hazards into play&mdash;again, each Pokemon has  advantages and disadvantages when compared to the others. Once the  hazards are down, however, unless you are able to exploit them, you just  wasted a very valuable turn.</p>
 
 <p>This article will go into the rights and wrongs of entry  hazards: what they do, how you can put them down, and different  strategies for using them to your advantage. There will also be specific  examples of Pokémon who do the best in one of those areas.</p>
 
 <h2>The Basics</h2>
 
 <p>The most common of the entry hazards in OU is by far Stealth  Rock, for pretty obvious reasons. There are seventeen Pokémon in OU  capable of putting it in play, as compared to only four for the other  two entry hazards. It is also the easiest to put down since it only  takes one layer, while the other two take two or three layers. Stealth  Rock is also the only hazard that can hit Flying-types and Pokemon with  the Levitate ability. Since it hits all Pokémon for at least some  damage, except for Pokémon with Magic Guard, it is also used to break  Focus Sash, which would otherwise be a very difficult item to work  around.</p>
 
 <p>Stealth Rock does damage based on how weak the defending  Pokémon is to Rock-type attacks. If the Pokémon doesn't have a weakness  or a resistance to Rock-type attacks, it will take 12.5% damage. If the  defending Pokémon is weak or resistant to Stealth Rock, the damage is a  direct multiple of 12.5%, ranging from 3.125% to 50%.</p>
 
 <p>Spikes are not as common as Stealth Rock, but are usually more  dangerous. Spikes are put down in up to three layers, and increase in  damage output with increasing layers. The downside is that they are only  able to hit grounded Pokémon. With one layer, the spikes do 12.5%  damage; two layers yield 18.75% damage; three layers do 25% damage with  each switch.</p>
 
 <p>Toxic Spikes are potentially the most dangerous of the entry  hazards. Like Spikes, they only affect grounded Pokémon. In addition,  any grounded Poison-type is able to absorb Toxic Spikes and take them  off the field for the remainder of the match. Because the effect is  Poison-type however, they are unable to hit Steel-types. The first layer  of Toxic Spikes acts as a standard poison. The switch-in takes 12.5%  damage per turn for the remainder of the battle. If two layers are down,  the switch-in becomes badly poisoned. The first turn, the Pokémon takes  6.25% damage. For every turn after that, another 6.25% is added on, so  the damage from the first three turns would be 6.25%, 12.5%, and 18.75%.  If the Pokémon switches out and comes back in, the damage starts over  at 6.25% again.</p>
 
 <h2>Laying the Hazards</h2>
 
 <h3>Stealth Rock</h3>
 
 <p>Many people view entry hazards as a must-have on any team, and  try to get them out as early as possible to reap the benefits sooner  rather than later. As such, many leads use Stealth Rock. Many players  now run anti-leads, to OHKO other leads before they have a chance to do  anything. The Stealth Rock leads have now had to adapt to these newer  anti-leads. One of these answers is Colbur Berry Azelf.</p>
 
 <p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/487.png" alt="" /><br />
 Azelf @ Colbur Berry<br />
 Ability: Levitate<br />
 EVs: 8 HP / 140 Atk / 144 SpD / 216 Spe<br />
 Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
 - Stealth Rock<br />
 - Taunt<br />
 - U-turn<br />
 - Explosion</p>
 
 <p>Against standard Azelf leads, Lead Machamp is able to 2HKO them  with a combination of Payback and Bullet Punch. With Colbur Berry  however, Azelf can Stealth Rock while taking the Payback, then Explode  or U-turn since Bullet Punch doesn't do enough damage to finish Azelf.  Since Azelf isn't using Focus Sash, it also has some EVs in HP and  Special Defense so it has more survivability. The HP allows it to always  survive max Attack Metagross' Meteor Mash so it can get Stealth Rock,  and switch out to be fodder later on. The Special Defense lets it take  Timid 252 EV Roserade's Leaf Storm. That also means it will survive  other attacks like LO Starmie's Hydro Pump and Shuca Heatran's Fire  Blast.</p>
 
 <p>Just like any other lead though, this one is not perfect. It  still has trouble against faster Scarf users like Jirachi, or hard  hitting priority-users like Choice Band Scizor. The most powerful  attacks like Specs Heatran's Overheat also can beat this Azelf since it  doesn't have Focus Sash anymore.</p>
 
 <p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/490.png" alt="" /><br />
 Heatran @ Choice Specs<br />
 Ability: Flash Fire<br />
 EVs: 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 Spe<br />
 Modest Nature (+SpA, -Atk)<br />
 - Overheat<br />
 - Earth Power<br />
 - Hidden Power Grass<br />
 - Stealth Rock</p>
 
 <p>Because Heatran has so much power, it has gained popularity,  given its ability to obliterate so many leads. Anti-lead Machamp is  easily OHKOed, as is Swampert, and even Occa Berry Metagross. Earth  Power can also OHKO Shuca Heatran, even though they will most likely  outspeed and OHKO you with Earth Power first. That is why some people  like going with max Speed on Specs Heatran: for the speed tie with other  Heatran.</p>
 
 <p>Stealth Rock is also used to get the best of both worlds from  Heatran. If the opposing lead is forced out by Heatran (Jirachi, for  example), why bother predicting with an attack when you can just get  your own Stealth Rock down? Once Stealth Rock is down, and Heatran  starts firing off powerful Overheats, not much will be sticking around  for long.</p>
 
 <p>When using a more defensive team like pure stall, your Stealth  Rocker will want to go along with that theme. Hippowdon is one of the  more popular Pokémon to lay Stealth Rock when using stall.</p>
 
 <p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/455.png" alt="" /><br />
 Hippowdon @ Leftovers<br />
 Ability: Sand Stream<br />
 EVs: 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD<br />
 Impish Nature: (+Def, -SpD)<br />
 - Earthquake<br />
 - Slack Off<br />
 - Stealth Rock<br />
 - Roar</p>
 
 <p>Hippowdon has incredible bulk and very reliable recovery in  Slack Off that is not seen to often in other Pokémon. Hippowdon can also  make use of Roar to start building up the entry hazard damage that is  so important with stall teams. With massive defensive bulk, it is able  to get Stealth Rock down on a multitude of Pokémon, and continue walling  them while chipping away with Earthquake. Hippowdon also adds to the  passive damage by starting a sandstorm with its ability.</p>
 
 <h3>Spikes</h3>
 
 <p>When using Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it's not as easy to abuse  the current metagame. The amount of available Pokémon drops from  seventeen with Stealth Rock to four with either Spikes or Toxic Spikes,  including Smeargle. With so few Pokémon to choose from, the type of team  you are building tends to do the choosing for you.</p>
 
 <p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/235.png" alt="" /><br />
 Smeargle @ Focus Sash<br />
 Ability: Own Tempo<br />
 EVs: 4 Atk / 252 Def / 252 Spe<br />
 Jolly Nature: (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
 - Spore<br />
 - Spikes<br />
 - U-turn<br />
 - Stealth Rock</p>
 
 <p>When using offensive teams, it's of the utmost importance to  keep the momentum in your favor. Smeargle does a good job of that,  simply because it has access to every move in the game. Being able to  put the defending Pokémon to sleep 100% of the time with Spore is a  great way of keeping said momentum, and usually leads towards more  Spikes. Due to the increase of anti-leads with priority attacks and Lum  Berries, Smeargle tends to have a difficult time in the lead position.  Because of its frailty, it also has a hard time coming in on anything,  which means you won't find many opportunities outside of the lead  position either. So if you're looking for Spikes on an offensive team,  you might want to look other places.</p>
 
 <p>With Salamence and Latias gone, Skarmory has dropped some in  usage. It was able to use both of them to set up, as well as Scizor, who  was most-used at the time. Since then, Heatran, who utterly destroys  Skarmory, has replaced Scizor at the #1 spot. Fire-types in general have  gotten more popular, as well as other Pokémon, like Zapdos, who don't  make Skarmory's life any easier.</p>
 
 <p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/227.png" alt="" /><br />
 Skarmory @ Leftovers<br />
 Ability: Keen Eye<br />
 EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe<br />
 Impish Nature: (+Def, -SpA)<br />
 - Brave Bird<br />
 - Roost<br />
 - Spikes<br />
 - Whirlwind</p>
 
 <p>This is likely one of the most obvious yet simple sets. With  Skarmory's massive Defense, it is able to tank many different moves to  set up Spikes. Skarmory has Roost to help it stall out the opponent and  set up the rest of its Spikes. Once it has enough layers down, it can  start using Whirlwind to begin racking up the Spikes damage. Brave Bird  can be used to finish off some Pokémon that are low on health. Even with  only a base 80 Attack stat, Brave Bird can still do a decent amount of  damage.</p>
 
 <p>Even though some Spikers aren't as useful in the current  metagame, one in particular is very happy that Salamence and Latias are  no longer around.</p>
 
 <p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/410.png" alt="" /><br />
 Roserade @ Leftovers<br />
 Ability: Natural Cure<br />
 EVs: 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 SpD<br />
 Calm Nature: (+SpD, -Atk)<br />
 - Spikes<br />
 - Grass Knot<br />
 - Hidden Power Fire<br />
 - Rest</p>
 
 <p>Roserade is very grateful for the lack of both Salamence and  Latias, as even if it has HP Ice, they both outspeed Roserade and can  OHKO or set up on it. Usually Roserade is used since it has access to Sleep Powder  and has a powerful base 125 Special Attack stat. The natural bulk it has  in Special Defense usually goes unnoticed though. Combined with Natural  Cure and Rest, it can easily stay around to get all three layers of  Spikes, while continuing to do decent damage with Grass Knot and its  other coverage move, not necessarily Hidden Power Fire. Roserade can  also fill the role of the Grass-type in the now popular Fire / Water /  Grass core, and has an easy time at setting up against opposing  Water-types. Even with the EVs focused in its defenses, Roserade still  has plenty of power, OHKOing LO Starmie with Stealth Rock, while only  taking 53.1% - 63% from Ice Beam.</p>
 
 <p>Roserade has a fantastic support movepool that can be utilized  in many ways. On this set in particular, you could easily run Toxic  Spikes and Sleep Powder over Spikes and your coverage move. If you  wanted to, you could also go with both Toxic Spikes and Spikes, and  forego the coverage move. There's also Leech Seed, which can be used as  another form of recovery instead of Rest. When choosing Roserade's  moveset, it's just important to remember that Spikes and Sleep Powder  are illegal together.</p>
 
 <h3>Toxic Spikes</h3>
 
 Going back to Roserade, even though its bulk is not to be  underestimated, its Special Attack stat of 125 is tied for the highest  of any Grass-type in the game with Exeggutor. However, Exeggutor's Speed  is nowhere close to Roserade's respectable base 90 Speed. Those two  stats make Roserade very effective in the lead spot as well.
 
 <p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/410.png" alt="" /><br />
 Roserade @ Focus Sash<br />
 Ability: Natural Cure<br />
 EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
 Timid Nature: (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
 - Toxic Spikes<br />
 - Sleep Powder<br />
 - Leaf Storm<br />
 - Hidden Power Fire</p>
 
 <p>Roserade's Speed lets it outpace a good amount of the OU leads.  Against bulkier leads without Lum Berry, Sleep Powder puts them right  out before they have a chance to lay their own hazards. Roserade has a  tougher time against the faster leads with Taunt, since it can't put  them to sleep or use Toxic Spikes. Leaf Storm does plenty of damage to  them though.</p>
 
 <p>Roserade is geared toward more of an offensive use of Toxic  Spikes. It can still be used for defensive approaches, but there is  another Pokémon that can usually do a better job of that.</p>
 
 <p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/205.png" alt="" /><br />
 Forretress @ Leftovers<br />
 Ability: Sturdy<br />
 EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
 Careful Nature: (+SpD, -SpA)<br />
 - Toxic Spikes<br />
 - Spikes<br />
 - Rapid Spin<br />
 - Payback</p>
 
 <p>This Forretress has an incredible amount of utility. Not only  can it lay down Toxic Spikes and Spikes, it can Rapid Spin other  hazards, and if a Ghost-type switches in to block it, Payback hits it  for a good amount of damage. Given Forretress' incredible base 140  Defense, it is able to set up on a multitude of Pokémon. The specially  defensive spread allows Forretress to take attacks from Pokémon like  Rotom-A with greater ease.</p>
 
 <p>One of the few downsides to Forretress in general is the lack  of reliable recovery. Without recovery, it becomes hard to continuously  take attacks. In that regard, it is advised to run Wish support with  this Forretress, which usually comes in the form of Blissey or  Vaporeon.</p>
 
 <h2>Abusing the Hazards</h2>
 
 <h3>Offensive Teams</h3>
 
 <p>If a Pokémon comes in with only 75% health, it will obviously  be much easier to KO, which is the premise behind using Spikes and  Stealth Rock on offensive teams. Kevin Garrett and august's <a  href="/forums/showthread.php?t=59454">Kevin, Please Come  Home</a> is a beautiful example of using Spikes effectively on an  offensive team. It uses hard-hitting offensive sweepers like Lucario and  the now Uber Salamence to blast holes in the opposing team. As the  opponent's Pokémon switch back and forth to check different threats,  they continue to take the passive damage and the predicted attacks, and  are eventually swept clean by one of Please Come Home's  Pokémon.</p>
 
 <p>Obviously this team is a bit out of date, as two of the key  Pokémon are now Uber, so when building offensive teams that abuse  Spikes, you'll need to explore other possibilities. The Specs Heatran  set mentioned earlier is an interesting choice, because even if you  predict correctly, you still can lose a massive chunk of health. Using  Choiced Pokémon is also a good idea as the opponent will be more willing  to switch out to try and catch you at a disadvantage. Anything that  forces your opponent to do more switching than usual is a good way to  abuse entry hazards in general.</p>
 
 <h3>Phazing</h3>
 
 <p>Phazing is any sort of move or strategy that forces your  opponent to switch Pokémon. These include moves such as Perish Song,  Whirlwind, and Roar. Roar is the most-seen move from that list because  so many Pokémon have access to it. Whirlwind has the advantage over Roar  in utility though, as any Pokémon with the ability Soundproof are  immune to Roar. Any Pokémon that causes many initial switches is a solid  candidate to abuse Roar.</p>
 
 <p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/130.png" alt="" /><br />
 Gyarados @ Leftovers<br />
 Ability: Intimidate<br />
 EVs: 248 HP / 248 Def / 12 Spe<br />
 Impish Nature: (+Def, -SpA)<br />
 - Waterfall<br />
 - Roar<br />
 - Rest<br />
 - Sleep Talk</p>
 
 <p>Gyarados can be a very dangerous sweeper if teams are  unprepared. Combined with Intimidate and a unique typing, many opponents  are forced to switch out. This is a prime time to abuse Roar. When the  initial Gyarados counter comes out, it already takes a possible 37.5%  damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes. Gyarados then forces it out with  Roar, and brings in another Pokémon which also takes that 37.5% damage.  The opponent might now be stuck with a Pokémon who also shudders under  Gyarados' presence. If the opponent switches back to the original  counter, they have now taken a possible grand total of 75%  damage&mdash;not too hot for a Pokémon that is supposed to stop  Gyarados. Obviously, you won't have three layers of Spikes and Stealth  Rock out everytime, but the damage continues to rack up like  that.</p>
 
 <p>If you also happen to have Toxic Spikes, Gyarados does an  amazing job at stalling out the opponent with Rest and Sleep Talk, and  letting the passive damage do the work for it. Gyarados' solid defenses,  typing, and ability can already keep it around for a long time, and  only increase in effectiveness with Rest. Sleep Talk is also helpful in  that it negates Roar's negative priority and sometimes allows Gyarados  to Roar before the opponent has a chance to attack.</p>
 
 <p>Philip7086's <a  href="/forums/showthread.php?t=59793">Team of Torment</a> is an  excellent team designed around doing just that. Forretress is used to  set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, while the rest of the team forces  switches. Both Latias and Gyarados can be dangerous sweepers on their  own, so when the opponent continuously switches out, it makes their job  even easier.</p>
 
 <h3>Stalling</h3>
 
 <p>It's harder to abuse Toxic Spikes in the same way you abuse  Stealth Rock and Spikes, so a different approach is needed. Since the  damage taken by Pokémon poisoned by two layers of Toxic Spikes increases  with every passing turn, you don't want your opponent to switch them  out. The best way to ensure that is by keeping the same Pokémon out  yourself. In order for your Pokémon to stay alive when they're up  against a check or counter, they must have some pretty good defenses and  reliable recovery.</p>
 
 <p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/385.png" alt="" /><br />
 Jirachi @ Leftovers<br />
 Ability: Serene Grace<br />
 EVs: 252 HP / 220 Def / 36 Spe<br />
 Bold Nature: (+Def, -Atk)<br />
 - Wish<br />
 - Calm Mind<br />
 - Psychic<br />
 - Thunderbolt</p>
 
 <p>I'm sure almost everybody reading this has at some point been  swept by this set. When using it, you simply Calm Mind on the initial  switch, and if Jirachi can beat the opposing Pokemon, just set up with  more Calm Minds and Wish when appropriate. WIth no offensive investment,  this set won't be doing much when up against the likes of Blissey.  Toxic Spikes are the perfect remedy for a Blissey walling this set.  Blissey will have no chance once the damage from Toxic Spikes piles on,  as building poison damage will eventually overwhelm its recovery. Even  while boosting its stats, Jirachi can just let Toxic Spikes do the  damage for it. When it has enough boosts, the opposing team won't be  able to do much as the damage will have already been done.</p>
 
 <p>Vashta's <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=56715">Team  Rose Tyler</a> shows just how effective Toxic Spikes can be when  used in this way. Not only does it have a Jirachi very similar to this  one, both Swampert and Rotom-W are very effective in their own right at  abusing Toxic Spikes. Swampert uses Rest and Sleep Talk like the  aforementioned Gyarados set, while Rotom-W uses Substitute and Charge  Beam to stall the opponent and boost its Special Attack stat. With so  many ways to abuse Toxic Spikes, many teams find themselves helpless in  front of them.</p>
 
 <p>If you're not using stat-uppers like these to abuse Toxic  Spikes, you're probably going to use the playstyle most famous for entry  hazards, stall. In fact, stall relies solely on entry hazards to do the  work of damaging the opponent's Pokémon. When using stall, your Pokémon  constantly cause your opponent to switch to an appropriate counter for  what you currently have out. As this cycle continues, your opponent's  Pokémon continue to take passive damage, as your own Pokémon continue to  heal, rinse, and repeat. Many simpler teams find themselves begging for  mercy in front of stall, which some battlers call the most consistent  playstyle.</p>
 
 <p>Taylor's <a  href="/forums/showthread.php?t=57810">Tyranitar Stall</a> is a  fairly up to date example of a good stall team. It has all the  characteristics of the general stall team and a small twist in Scarf  Tyranitar. It certainly showed how effective Scarf Tyranitar  is on stall teams, taking out the now Uber Dragon-types, Latias and  Salamence.  When people realized how many dangerous threats Tyranitar  covered, it began appearing everywhere, even after Latias and Salamence  are gone.</p>
 
 <h2>Wrapping it Up</h2>
 
 <p>Entry hazards are never to be underestimated. In many battles,  we have all switched our final Pokémon in only to have it KOed by  Stealth Rock. Toxic Spikes and Spikes can both be devastating when used  in the right way. Many team builders overlook entry hazards other than  Stealth Rock when building their team, so many teams tend to be weak to  the strategies behind the other entry hazards.</p>
 
 <p>So when team building, don't just think about your Dragonite  only having 75% health when switching in, but think about what the other  entry hazards can do to your team. Make sure that you won't be wiped  out by stall or bulky Pokémon like Calm Mind Jirachi or Suicune and the  like. Just be careful and watch your step when you're team building. You  wouldn't want to trip!</p>
