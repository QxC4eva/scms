[Overview]

<p>Despite its chubby (and cute!) appearance, Purugly is one of NU's fastest Pokemon, boasting an impressive base 112 Speed. Sadly, this is its only worthwhile stat, with a mediocre Attack stat and paper-thin defenses. It also suffers from a shallow movepool, and its defensive capabilities are that of any standard Normal-type; although, this is somewhat alleviated by the resistances it gets from its ability, Thick Fat. It also faces strong competition from another other Normal-type: Persian. Persian runs a similar scout set, but has Technician to boost Fake Out.</p>

<p>However, it is not all doom and gloom for this gorgeous feline. Purugly's extra resistances granted by Thick Fat and ability to damage bulky Pokemon with Super Fang set it apart from its Normal-type brethren, and its blistering Speed and passable Attack let it scout and revenge kill effectively. While held back by its various flaws, Purugly has just enough in terms of base stats and movepool to pull off its sets.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to its high base Speed, Purugly can use a combination of Fake Out and U-turn to deal quick damage and swiftly leave the battlefield without taking any damage. Although it has a measly 40 Base Power, Fake Out's priority and 100% flinch rate effectively give Purugly free damage on the opposing Pokemon. However, Ghost-type Pokemon are immune to it, so take caution if you see a Ghost-type in Team Preview. As Fake Out can only be used when you switch in, U-turn is the perfect follow up move, letting Purugly deal a parting blow while only taking Life Orb damage against slower opponents. U-turn is the ultimate scouting move, keeping the momentum on your side and taking advantage of the opponent's Purugly switch-ins. Return is a reliable STAB move that can revenge kill a weakened foe, whereas Super Fang lets you deal damage to the Rock- and Steel-types that otherwise wall Purugly. Taunt is a useful move for neutering set-up sweepers and hazard setters, but Shadow Claw can be used if you really want the extra coverage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Life Orb and max Attack EVs aim to make Purugly as powerful as possible, whereas the Speed EVs and a Jolly nature let it outspeed positive base 105 Speed Pokemon, such as Rapidash. An Adamant nature provides more power to Purugly's moves, but is inferior as you will then lose to positive base 92 Speed Pokemon and above, as well as Quick Feet Ursaring. As Thick Fat is one of the only factors that separates Purugly from its fellow Normal-types, it is the only ability that should be used. Knock Off can remove the myriad of Eviolites in the tier; Hypnosis, on the other hand, can be used if you want to inflict status, but its unreliable accuracy makes it outclassed by Purugly's other options.</p>

<p>As Purugly will be switching a lot, it appreciates spin support to avoid damage from hazards, which can add up when combined with Life Orb recoil. Cryogonal, although the best NU spinner, shares an unfortunate Fighting-type weakness with Purugly; other spinners&mdash;such as Torkoal and Wartortle&mdash;don't but are generally outclassed by Cryogonal in their spinning ability. Purugly benefits Pokemon that appreciate a free turn to set up and extra damage to gain some KOs. Devastating set-up sweepers, such as Gorebyss and other Shell Smashers, are solid examples.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Return / Body Slam
move 2: Shadow Claw

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Purugly only has a mediocre Attack stat, a Choice Band can boost it to respectable levels, and with its brilliant base Speed it can function as a decent revenge killer. However, it faces strong competition from Persian, who has better Attack and Speed and a wider movepool to choose from. However, Purugly's resistances gained through Thick Fat and its ability to hit Steel-types with Super Fang set it apart from Persian. Return is a strong, reliable STAB move, but Body Slam can be used for the nice paralysis rate; if using Body Slam, however, the drop in power can be quite noticable. Shadow Claw grants Purugly perfect coverage, hitting Ghost-types super effectively, while U-turn lets it escape from sticky situations and maintain momentum. Purugly uses Super Fang to deal with the Rock- and Steel-types that wall Purugly, whereas Quick Attack gives it priority to finish off faster threats, such as Swellow and Choice Scarf users.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice Band and maximum Attack EVs, Purugly can pack quite a punch. Although an Adamant nature would grant even more power, without a Jolly nature Purugly will be outsped by Pokemon such as Rapidash and Quick Feet Ursaring. Wake-Up Slap is another possible move to deal with Rock- and Steel-types, but Super Fang lets you deal with other defensive Pokemon that Wake-Up Slap does not deal super effective damage to.</p>

<p>Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon take a pittance from Purugly's main attacks and cannot be beaten by Super Fang alone. Charizard can roast Steel-types with its powerful Fire-type STAB, and Gorebyss can similarly counter Rock-types. Sweepers that appreciate the removal of fast but frail Pokemon work well as teammates. Purugly will be switching a lot after being locked into its revenge killing move, so spin support from Armaldo or Torkoal is again appreciated. Having hazards on the opponent's side of the field also helps Purugly score some crucial KOs. As such, Pokemon such as Golem and Regirock can set up Stealth Rock while countering Swellow, who outspeeds and KOs Purugly.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Purugly can use a boosting set with Hone Claws, but it is usually too frail to set up. It can use its high base Speed to set up weather, such as rain or sun, for its teammates. If so, use a Damp / Heat Rock to extend the length of the weather. Toxic can be used as a form of status to put pressure on very bulky Pokemon, such as Regirock and Golem. A gimmicky combination of Fake Out and Last Resort can give Purugly a high-powered STAB move to break through teams, but is completely walled by Ghost-types, who are immune to both moves. Sucker Punch can be used as another form of priority to hit Ghost-types. It can run a set with its Dream World Ability, Defiant, to take advantage of Pokemon who lower stats. However, stat-lowering moves are rare, and losing the resistances from Thick Fat is not the best idea. Purugly can can also run a set with a Choice Scarf, outspeeding nearly every Pokemon, Choice Scarfed or not, in the metagame. However, there is a noticeable loss of power when Purugly has no boosts.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Even when boosted by items such as Choice Band, its mediocre Attack only becomes passable. This lets physically bulky Pokemon&mdash;especially the Rock- and Steel-types that resist its STAB attack&mdash;wall it with relative ease, although they have to be wary of Purugly that run Super Fang. Ghost-types are a near complete stop to the Scout set due to their virtue of typing; their immunity to Normal-type attacks means that the best Purugly can do is U-turn out, which will still deal pitiful damage. Faster Pokemon will kill it with ease, with hard hitters such as Swellow naturally outspeeding it, while Choice Scarfed Pokemon, such as Sawk, demolish our poor, innocent kitten.</p>
