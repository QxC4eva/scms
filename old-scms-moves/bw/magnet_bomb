<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Magnet Bomb should not be used competitively. It is weaker than Iron Head, which most Pokemon with access to Magnet Bomb get. Furthermore, Steel is a subpar attacking type, relegating Magnet Bomb to use as a secondary STAB move, if at all.</p>
