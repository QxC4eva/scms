Overview
########

Frillish is a very underrated and underused ghost type, while it can effectively wall a lot of common threats thanks to it's amazing special defense, good typing, access to Will-o-Wisp and reliable recovery. Cursed Body can disable moves, what helps it a lot in stall games, while Water Absorb heals it if used right.


Frillish is weak to the common Knock Off, but it ussually lives non-STAB Knock Offs after which it can burn or Recover, while Cursed Body gives a chance to disable Knock Off. It doesn't like VoltTurn teams that wear it down, even though it can usually recover back to full health.


SET NAME
########
name: Bulk
move 1: Recover
move 2: Scald
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Will-O-Wisp
ability: Cursed Body
item: Eviolite
evs: 156 SDef / 196 Def / 156 HP
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Recover heals 50% hp, which is 12 hp recovery each time.

Scald is STAB #1 and the burn chance is nice to have.

Shadow Ball is the more powerfull STAB.

Will-O-Wisp is there to burn physical treats and other bulky pokemon.

Set Details
========

Eviolite for added bulk.

The EVs and nature are set to have even defenses and HP to maximize Eviolite gains/recovery.



Usage Tips
========

Bring in on Pokémon that usually don't carry a Supper Effective move or don't have the power to do more then 50% damage.

Burn as many opponents as possible, especially physical sweepers.


Team Options
========

Spritzee is a good partner because it is very bulky, resists dark and can Wish support while Frillish resists both of Spritzee's weaknesses.

Bulky Normal types like Porygon, Munchlax and Lickitung have great synergy because Frillish is immune to their only weakness.

Other Options
########

Toxic instead of Will-O-Wisp to hurt other bulky pokemon.

Acid Armor and max hp max+ spD rest spA.

Dark Pulse, Energy Ball, Ice Beam, Psychic, Sludge Bomb, Giga Drain or any Hidden Power can work as coverage moves.
If you want to stop status, Safeguard is an option.

Checks & Counters
########

Pawniard almost always OHKOs with knock off

Chinchou doesnt fear anything from Frillish while Volt switch does about 50%

Misdreavus can Nasty Plot and OHKO with Shadow Ball or just 2HKO with Shadow Ball, while Frillish can't OHKO.
