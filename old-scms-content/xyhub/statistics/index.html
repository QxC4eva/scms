<h2>Usage Statistics</h2>
	
	<p><strong>The simulator battle statistics</strong> are compiled and created by <a href="/forums/member.php?u=45129">Antar</a>. The statistics are the usage of each individual pokemon that is collected during rated battles in a tier.</p>
	<p>We currently have six official tiers: Ubers, OU, UU, RU, NU, and Little Cup.</p>
