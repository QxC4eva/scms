<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Pok&eacute;mon world is an expansive one, packed full of spectacular sights to be seen. If it's not the Pok&eacute;mon themselves or the bonds that they share with their trainers, it's the physical nature of the world itself. From Kanto to Unova, this world is filled with geological anomalies that may not make sense to the average bystander. It is these areas that leave so many people captivated. It seems that many are attracted to sights, such as the Abyssal Ruins of Unova, Diglett's Cave of Kanto, and Mirage Island of Hoenn, because of the mystery surrounding them. Scientists have explored each of these locations, but little has been discovered to understand them. Even if we don't understand how or why these locations exist, we can at least get a better understanding of what is known about them.</p>

<h2>Abyssal Ruins</h2>

<p>The Abyssal Ruins are perhaps one of the most puzzling locations in the Pok&eacute;mon world, and it's not difficult to tell why; it is easily the most difficult location to access. In order to reach the Abyssal Ruins, one must dive deep below the surface of Undella Bay, just off the coast of Undella Town. The different spots where one may dive to access this area is not too difficult to spot, as they are marked by shadows on the surface of the water. However, finding them is not the difficult part. What's so hard about reaching this location is the act of diving down itself. Due to the depth of the ruins, simply swimming downward towards the them will not cut it; the strength of a Pok&eacute;mon is necessary in order to plummet down to the bottom-most depths of the bay where the ruins are located. What's more, it's difficult to breathe down so deep, so an average trainer can't access this area so easily. Even if one is able to access this area, he will still find it difficult to wander around. After finally reaching the ruins and making it inside, occasional torrents and rushes of water flow through its lengthy halls, pushing out anyone that attempts to explore it.</p>

<p>If the explorer does get the opportunity to venture throughout the Abyssal Ruins, he still may not really understand much of what he sees. There are many pillars scattered throughout the ruins with words inscribed on them that make little to no sense. This is because the words are written in the Roman alphabet. However, even if you understand their meaning, the actual meaning behind the words is still hard to understand. On the first of four floors in the ruins, the pillars contain text describing a brave king who fought for his people. Then on the second floor, you can find words on life, war, and the struggle of good versus evil. The third floor continues to describe the aforementioned king, a man who talks to all of his subjects and acts as a symbol of hope for them. Finally, on the top floor, the same king is described as "hope and future." It also tells its readers about defeating somebody whose name is unreadable. It even names the king himself, but once again, the name is still not understood to this day.</p>

<p>Ultimately, while the idea of these underwater ruins is hardly inconceivable, it's the story behind them that leaves the people of the Pok&eacute;mon world puzzled. We learn in these ruins of a king who conquered and served as a symbol of hope and future for his people, but we don't know who this hero was or even who he conquered. Perhaps historians can one day finish the tale of this brave man, but until they do, he will remain one of the many anomalies of the Pok&eacute;mon world.</p>

<h2>Diglett's Cave</h2>

<div class="float-right"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/geological_diglett.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>While we may know the creators of Kanto's infamous Diglett's Cave, it is still quite the mystery for those residing in the Pok&eacute;mon world; what makes Diglett's Cave so interesting is how a group of Diglett managed to create an entire cave just by burrowing below the ground. Perhaps the most interesting tidbit is that the cave was formed unintentionally; the Diglett responsible for it traveled in this area mainly to access food and safer areas to breed than for the purpose of constructing this area. While traveling through this area, the ground above slowly dissolved and eroded, causing deposits of clay to fall and form what eventually became the base of the cave. As the Diglett continued their constant travels, the cave continued to develop into what they are today.</p>

<p>This cave is deceivingly long, only adding to the surprise many hold when they first discover how the cave was formed. Diglett's Cave stretches all the way from Route 2, just south of Pewter City, Route 11, located just east of Vermillion City. Because of the direct route from one entrance of the cave to the other, the distance one must travel to reach either end is admittedly not very long. However, Diglett's Cave is burrowed underneath Routes 6 and 7. What's even more impressive is that this little tunnel, dug by Pok&eacute;mon that are less than a foot high and two pounds in weight on average, has parts that are located under the most populated city in Kanto—Celadon City. Because of the amount of traffic Celadon City sees on a daily basis, one might believe that the cave would cause parts of the city to collapse, yet somehow, despite its unintentional formation, the cave has managed to coexist harmoniously with Celadon City.</p>

<p>Unlike the elusiveness of the other locations explained here, the prominence of Diglett's Cave is based more on functionality than aesthetic appeal, as it links together the two aforementioned major cities in the Kanto region. In fact, should a trainer want to reach Viridian or Pewter City after having reached Cerulean City, Diglett's Cave is the easiest way to reach either of them. Otherwise, a trainer would have to rely on his Pok&eacute;mon in order to Fly or Surf back to either location. Having said that, it is hardly a surprise that many trainers rely on the cave as a means of transit. Aside from the tales behind the Diglett unintentionally creating this tunnel, this is the main reason why Diglett's Cave remains prominent—and most likely why it will continue to be so for some time to come.</p>

<h2>Mirage Island</h2>

<div class="float-right"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/geological_mirage.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Undoubtedly the most interesting of all of the locations mentioned, Mirage Island is an island that is rumored to be located to the east of the small oceanic community of Pacifidlog Town. What is significant about this location is that there is so little known about it because it is so difficult to uncover. In fact, only once in a very rare while is this island even seen, and no one is quite sure why. All we have to base our information off of is documented cases of trainers stumbling upon this area—in most cases, trainers who uncover it are unaware that it was even a mystery. Even the Pok&eacute;dex, a piece of technology that is advanced beyond our time, will consider a Pok&eacute;mon caught here to have been captured on Route 130 rather than the island itself.</p>

<p>In Pacifidlog Town, there is an old man who informs trainers as to when the island is visible. For reasons unknown to the trainers who frequently visit him, this man is constantly aware of the island without even being able to see the island from his home. It is for this reason that many trainers do not even believe in the existence of this area. However, many others have had the opportunity to visit the island, and they all attest to the man's credibility.</p>

<p>What is perhaps most strange about the island is that it is the only location where Wynaut are thought to reside. Moreover, on this island, multiple trainers have stated that they have been able to collect a Liechi Berry upon arrival. The Liechi Berry is the only one that produces a Gold Pok&eacute;block, so it is sought out by trainers across the lands.</p>

<p>In the end, nobody truly knows for sure whether this island exists or if it is truly just a mirage. Those who claim to have visited the island are adamant about it's existence, and it's hard to argue with their perseverance on the matter. In the meantime, scientists will continue to seek out this island in order to confirm the rumors surrounding it. People all across the Pok&eacute;mon world have heard tales of Mirage Island, and many will not rest until they are able to reach it for themselves.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The science behind these mysterious locations is still relatively new, even for those that have existed for some time. There are still many different areas in the Pok&eacute;mon world that still have yet to be explained, and there may even be some other mysteries yet to be uncovered. One thing, however, is certain: only through exploration and examination can we grow to understand them. Don't hesitate to explore the boundaries of the Pok&eacute;mon world. Who knows? You may be the next trainer to discover a new and exciting location!</p>
