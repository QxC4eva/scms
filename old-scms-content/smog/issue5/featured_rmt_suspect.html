<p>With the recent upstart of Suspect Test Stage 3.2, The Smog decided that it would be an excellent idea to include a Suspect RMT in this Issue's Featured RMTs. This team was very succesful, reaching #1 on the suspect ladder while gaining suspect experience by using 2 out of the 3 suspects. This issue's Featured Suspect RMT is none other than "Kovin" by Jibaku!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>I’ve posted Uber teams, and I have posted OU Teams. But this time, instead of going forward and backward from the cycle of OU and Ubers, I went for Suspect. It is a great metagame, with things moving along faster and having bigger holes to exploit. This is an excellent metagame for new gimmicks to thrive, due to more centralization (remember guys centralization is not necessarily bad!). However, I don’t have much time in my hands to create a lot of gimmicks to use :(</p>
<p>Instead, I took my original Stage 3 team, threw in Latias over Latios, threw Haban on Garchomp, and edited the set a bit. The team worked surprisingly well, netting me the #1 spot on the Suspect Leaderboard (as Cicada) in just three days (coincidentally, Stage 3)! As we currently speak, I have 1638 CRE on that alt. I also have another alt in the top 15…but enough bragging!</p>
<p>The team acts as an anti-metagame of sorts, with entry hazards absolutely decimating well…almost everything the metagame focuses on. It starts out slowly, then I slowly accelerate as entry hazards are put down, then more as Garchomp is brought out closer to the end of the game. Despite the overall bulk of this team, it actually moves a bit faster than you’d think.</p>

<h3>The Inside Scoop</h3>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/248.png" alt="Tyranitar" /><br />
Tyranitar (M) @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 HP/6 Atk/252 SDef<br />
Sassy nature (+SDef, -Spd)<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Payback<br />
- Low Kick</p>
<p>Tyranitar may not be the best lead in the metagame, but I honestly don’t have any other choices as far as this team goes. And as a lead itself, it isn’t bad, and often gets rocks early with plenty of health to spare. With Sandstorm on turn one, expect things to get whittled down quickly as it cancels out the non-immune Pokemon’s Leftovers recoveries, whereas only two of my Pokemon are hurt by the sand.</p>
<p>The moveset might be strange, so I’ll explain it to you. Stealth Rock is obvious. Ice Beam catches Garchomps trying to set up. It doesn’t OHKO, but it does with SR + Spikes down. Since Garchomps tend to come around during late game, most of the time I have entry hazards down. Late game Garchomps also tend to set up unlike early game chomps, and are easily taken down by Ice Beam. Payback is a STAB move that takes advantage of Tyranitar’s low Speed, and helps me deal with Latias. It is chosen over Crunch as the extra power does help, and two crunches with a def drop on the initial hit has the same damage output as Payback anyways. Low Kick is an odd move for me to use, but I needed to cover Magnet Rise Magnezone and hit Heatran at the same time. I don’t like Superpower’s lowering Atk/Def side effect, especially when a Garchomp swaps into it. Garchomp can OHKO a -1 Def Ttar with EQ, but won’t OHKO this one. Of course, lowering my attack against a Magnezone means the next Pokemon can swap in and take less damage from Payback. Low Kick is especially useful in decimating other TTar leads.</p>
<p>I decided that I’d go on the defensive route for TTar. Simply put, TTar is an all-purpose Pokemon. It eats up Starmies, Heatrans and Latiases and whatnot, so I maxed out its Special Defensive capabilities. I am too lazy (unfortunately) to calculate stuff so it’s currently with 252/6/252. I purposely didn’t put any speed EVs in there because I want to hurt Blissey with maximum power using Payback. People sometimes underestimate how sturdy this thing is – it took 42% from a Life Orb Starmie’s Surf a while ago! Forget weaknesses. TTar has roughly double Special defensive capability as a max/max careful Scizor</p>

Latias (F) @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 6 HP/252 Spd/252 SAtk<br />
Timid nature (+Spd, -Atk)<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Trick<br />
- Surf</p>

<p>In the loss of Latios during this Stage I have placed in Latias, and she performs her job just as good as her brother’s (no lie). The moveset is fairly obvious (right??): Draco Meteor for insane power, Surf for coverage, and Thunderbolt for Skarmories. Trick is for stall teams who think they can wall Latias with Blissey. Later on in the game, she and Rotom-H clean up the remnants of the waste.</p>
<p>Latias does a lot for this team. Firstly and most importantly, it checks the supercommon Garchomp, who dies straight up from Draco Meteor regardless of Haban berry (unless you are elevator_music -__-). It also holds the team against the ever-so-dangerous Manaphy and otherwise just decimates a lot of stuff for the rest of the team to clean up. She helps handle Infernape and is the team’s Water resist. Although she tends to become Pursuit bait, the entry hazards on this field often ensure that one Pokemon dies before she goes to waste (unless that Pokemon is a suicide bait >_>).</p>
<p>Latias may not have been as powerful as Latios is during Stage 3, but considering her role in the team her extra defenses prove handy as she will be switching into attacks quite a bit. She is still subjected to Sandstorm damage unfortunately, but eh I can’t have everything.</p>
<p><strong><em>(Current thought on Latias: OU)</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/227.png" alt="Skarmory" /><br />
Skarmory (M) @ Shed Shell<br />
Ability: Keen Eye<br />
EVs: 252 HP/40 Spd/216 SDef<br />
Careful nature (+SDef, -SAtk)<br />
- Brave Bird<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Whirlwind<br />
- Roost</p>
<p>Skarmory is perhaps the team’s MOST important member, even more than Latias, due to its resistances and bulk, and of course, SPIKES. Now as some of you probably know, Spikestacking is my favorite technique, and for a good reason: it helps control what they switch in. Double switching is very hard under Spikes (unless you’re a levitator…), and you’d lose lot of health if you get outpredicted. This forces the opponent into playing more conservatively and therefore easier to exploit. Skarmory is the definition of the anti-metagame Pokemon in Staage 3, both times.</p>
<p>“Special Defensive Skarmory?? Are you mad? Stage 3 part one is over! There is no need for that much Special Defense...?</p>
<p>Or so you’d probably think.</p>
<p>Although Garchomp is a looming threat, we can’t just ignore the other two suspects. Manaphy loves swapping into Skarmory, only to find out Surf doesn’t do TOO much damage and it whirlwinded out (if it tail glows them sucks to be them). Latias is forced to use Thunderbolt/HP Fire to stop it, as Skarmory shrugs off Draco Meteor and Surf with ease. If Latias for whatever reason tries to Calm Mind, it’ll lose even more. The extra Special defense also helps Skarmory land Spikes MUCH easier on stuff like Flamethrower Blissey, while not losing too much of its physical defensive ability due to its fantastic typing and Roost.</p>
<p>I originally had Leftovers instead of Shed Shell, but I realized that I DON’T want to lose two Pokemon to Magnezone. I reluctantly stuck Shed Shell on Skarmory and I miss the recovery.</p>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/499.png" alt="Rotom-H" /><br />
Rotom-h @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 248 HP/220 Def/40 Spd<br />
Bold nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Will-o-wisp<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Rest / Pain Split / Reflect</p>
<p>Spinblocker. Gyarados stopper. Explosion absorber. Fighting absorber (Latias sucks at taking repeated Close Combats). It a general pain in the butt.</p>
<p>With that said, not much else needs to be explained about Rotom. Thunderbolt for STAB, Will-o-Wisp to burn stuff and Shadow Ball to hit Latias switch ins. I have never actually used Rest (except against Jirachi at one point), but it was Reyscarface’s idea. It might help at some point against Blisseys though.</p>
<p>I must admit I didn’t put any thought into the EV spread unlike I usually do. 248 HP EVs instead of 252 due to Sandstorm. Then I focused on physical bulk for Gyarados’ annoying Waterfalls. I should probably add more SDef to handle Starmie easier, but meh I dunno how to fix the EV spread...or the last moveslot</p>
<p>Rotom-H also helps Latias in breaking stall, by burning Hippowdons, Thunderbolting Skarmories and everything else, really. As if Blissey can wall it after I tricked away its Leftovers...</p>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/450.png" alt="Garchomp" /><br />
Garchomp (M) @ Haban Berry<br />
Ability: Sand Veil<br />
EVs: 252 Atk/6 Def/252 Spd<br />
Jolly nature (+Spd, -SAtk)<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Fire Fang<br />
- Earthquake</p>
<p>What is a suspect team without this?</p>
<p>Garchomp is a very powerful Pokemon, and is the center of the Stage 3 metagame. This is a straightforward “stat up then kill” set because it is simply the best. Haban Berry is an awesome item that allows me to survive assaults from other Garchomps in dire times, as well as non Specs Latiases. It originally was Leftovers during the first portion of Stage 3. Sand Veil is also a cool bonus.</p>
<p>Aside from filling in Suspect EXP and being a powerhouse, Garchomp serves as the team’s rock resist and checks Lucario, who I have problems with otherwise (and still do). However, the only time he ever comes into the early-mid game is when it is needed to get rid of certain threats.</p>
<p>Garchomp is a great sweeper towards the end, but has troubles pulling off a kill in the early game. Most of the time, I would Dragon Claw away at a Heatran or Magnezone early game and often catch their Latias. However, it sucks when a Skarmory comes out instead of Latias (and even worse if they DO end up having a Latias after all…oh wait both are in my team). I only use Earthquake when I feel confident.</p>
<p>Dragon Claw is chosen over Outrage because I don’t like to be locked and be open to revenge kills. Although it loses a large amount of power, getting locked is way worse when their Latias or Scizor comes out and finishes Chomp off >_>. Fire Fang is picked over Fire Blast because it gets boosted with Swords Dance and doesn’t get walled by SDef Skarmory. Plus, I hate Fire Blast’s accuracy. The EVs are pretty much standard, but since Garchomp isn’t always going to be setting up I focused on maxing attack to dish out maximum damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>(Current thought on Garchomp : OU)</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/212.png" alt="Scizor" /><br />
Scizor (M) @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 248 HP/252 Atk/8 Spd<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SAtk)<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Pursuit</p>
<p>Scizor supports the team with the ever-so important priority, as well as being a second Steel-type.</p>
<p>“Choice Band Scizor doesn’t work in this metagame” – reachzero. And I am tempted to agree actually. Magnezone loves eating up Scizors (worst if they have SubChargebeam). I swapped out into Swords Dancer for a while, but I realized there was stuff that the Swords Dancer couldn’t do.</p>
<p>I found the Starmie weakness on this team to be disturbing, and Swords Dance Scizor really hurts me against that. I just want to get rid of it ASAP with Pursuit, then re set up all entry hazards later. There are more than just Starmie that the extra boost that comes in Choice Band is needed – it can smack mid-health Garchomps ( hello Spikes + SR – in case Latias couldn’t get rid of Chomp the first time due to Tyranitar swapping in or whatever), as well as finish off Lucario better. U-turn abuses Spikes/SR, while Superpower is practically a last ditch attack against a Skarmory.</p>
<p>The EVs are once again the byproduct of laziness. 248 HP because max HP is terrible, especially with Spikes flying everywhere. Max Attack for power.</p>
<p>Scizor is unfortunately not as good as he is in the OU metagame. Skarmory is quite common and sponges its attacks easily, putting Spikes up in the process and limiting the times it can come in.</p>
</div>
<p>The first thing you will notice about the team is how it is a balanced team leaning towards semi-stall, with a bulky Stealth Rocking lead, a Spiker, a Ghost-type to block Rapid Spin, and three offensive Pokémon who also help to make up a rather solid defensive core. Spikes allow Garchomp to sweep much easier, as with the already absurd amount of switches it causes, the opposition is bound to get worn down eventually, possibly succumbing to a Swords Dance Garchomp sweep.</p>
<p>Tyranitar is an interesting choice in the lead spot, and it allows Jibaku to easily defeat leads like Azelf and set up Stealth Rock. Tyranitar also plays a large role other than just being the lead, as with the heavy Special Defense investment, it is a very capable counter to Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Latias, and a hoard of other Pokémon. Tyranitar also has the role of weather changing, which allows Jibaku to have an easier time against rain teams, as with only one Water-type resister, he can not continuously stand up to rain-boosted Water-type assaults. While some may look at this set and say "Low Kick?!", there is a perfectly viable reason behind Jibaku using Low Kick as opposed to Superpower. Low Kick gives Jibaku a solid physical Fighting-type attack that doesn't lower his Attack, which is rather crucial. The only other option is Superpower, which lowers both Attack and Defense one stage, which essentially leaves Tyranitar as a sitting duck. Low Kick also helps with Substitute Magnezone.</p>
<p>The combination of Skarmory and Rotom-H never gets old, and it is the combination that Jibaku's core seems to revolve around. Skarmory has a ton of oppurtunities to set up Spikes in suspect, whether it be against something like Choice Scarf Garchomp or even Choice Specs Latias, thanks to the Special Defense investment. Special Defense Skarmory was a huge hit last suspect test, and Jibaku says it's just as good as it ever was right now. Without a Ghost-type, all of Skarmory's hard work setting up Spikes would go to waste, and this is where Rotom-H is so useful. Rotom-H is a solid Rapid Spin blocker against Forretress thanks to Will-O-Wisp, and is also rather good against Leftovers Rapid Spin Starmie, although Life Orb variants can be quite a pain and thus Rapid Spinning against them is often not worth the risk of taking near 70%. The synergy between the two is also rather impressive, with Skarmory easily taking powerful Ghost- and Dark-type attacks, while Rotom-H handles Electric-type attacks without much harm, and with three Fire-type resisters, powerful Fire-type attacks are not much of a problem.</p>
<p>Latias is one of our three suspects for this stage, and it has found it's way into Jibaku's team. Latias is an excellent check to Swords Dance Garchomp, even OHKOing through Haban Berry (barring obnoxiously Special Defense oriented spreads) as well as easily being able to come into anything that isn't Dragon Claw or Outrage. Latias is also Jibaku's Manaphy check and only Water-type resister, which is somewhat dangerous considering Latias's Pursuit weakness. Trick allows Latias to cripple incoming walls, such as Blissey, which results in Skarmory being able to use Spikes much easier, which allows Jibaku to inch that much closer to his overall goal of victory. With a bit of Spikes and Stealth Rock support, Latias can easily spam Draco Meteor without having to worry, as even Steel-types, like Scizor, are 2HKOed by Draco Meteor with Spikes / Stealth Rock.</p>
<p>Our second suspect is the infamous Garchomp, of whom I'm sure all of you have heard. Garchomp provides Jibaku with a solid late game cleaner, especially in the wake of three layers of Spikes and Stealth Rock. Garchomp also provides a secondary defensive backbone, being the team's only Rock-type resister as well as being the only check on this team to Swords Dance Lucario, which is a pretty scary thought. Fire Fang is chosen over Fire Blast because it allows Jibaku to hit Skarmory with a perfect accuracy attack, as well as still being able to beat Special Defense Skarmory. Dragon Claw over Outrage is so Jibaku does not get locked into a Dragon-type attack and easily become setup fodder for the likes of Skarmory or just get easily KOed by Pokémon like Mamoswine or Choice Specs Latias.</p>
<p>The last Pokémon on Jibaku's team is Scizor, also the second Dragon-type resister. Scizor provides Jibaku with a semi-decent Latias switch-in, should Tyranitar get KOed (although admittedly Latias is starting to run Hidden Power Fire rather often on suspect), as well as a way to kill Life Orb Starmie, although strictly via revenge killing. Bullet Punch is still a solid priority attack just as it is in OU, and is capable of 2HKOing Garchomp after Spikes, making Scizor a decent swap into Choice Scarved Outrages. Scizor is admittedly not Jibaku's best member, not working as well as it does in OU, and is often more of a safety hazard due to the uprise of Magnezone on the suspect ladder; however, U-turn allows Jibaku to force switches and keep momentum in his favor, while simultaneously racking up damage from his omnipresent entry hazards. It also helps him in evading potential Magnezone traps.</p>
<p>Although this is a great team that has had a lot of success, it has weaknesses just like any other Pokémon team. Life Orb Starmie is a giant pain to Jibaku, as Tyranitar needs to be above 50% and Scizor must be in optimal health in order for him to handle it easily. Swords Dance Lucario is an absolute menace, particularly if Garchomp isn't at full health or if a smart Lucario user spams Close Combats to weaken the core first and manages to catch Garchomp. In conclusion, this is an excellent team with a small amount of weaknesses that has continuously shown how successful it is in the strange new world that is Stage 3.2!</p>
