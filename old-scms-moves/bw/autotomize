Boosts user's Speed by 2 stages. Reduces user's weight.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Speed by two stages. If the user's Speed was changed by the effect of this move, the user's weight is reduced by 100 kg as long as it remains active. This effect is stackable but cannot reduce the user's weight to less than 0.1 kg. The change in weight caused by this move cannot be transferred through the move Baton Pass.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Autotomize is essentially a slightly better version of Rock Polish and Agility. All Pokemon that can learn Autotomize appreciate the reduction in weight to help them withstand the occasional Low Kick or Grass Knot. Autotomize should be used over Rock Polish whenever the opportunity presents itself unless your Pokemon is using the move Heavy Slam (which will have its power reduced thanks to the weight reduction).</p>
