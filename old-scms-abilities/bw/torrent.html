<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is at 1/3 HP or less, all of its Water-type moves will have 50% more power.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>It has next to no use as an ability these days. None of the Water-type starters get much love these days, except for maybe <a href="/bw/pokemon/blastoise">Blastoise</a>, who would much rather use <a href="/bw/abilities/rain_dish">Rain Dish</a> to heal its health in rain. <a href="/bw/pokemon/swampert">Swampert</a> has fallen from grace a by quite a bit, arguably being outclassed by <a href="/bw/pokemon/gastrodon">Gastrodon</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/quagsire">Quagsire</a> in the Water- / Ground-type department. Even so, <a href="/bw/pokemon/empoleon">Empoleon</a> can make use of it in UU thanks to its classic <a href="/bw/moves/agility">Agility</a> SubPetaya set, which can even be useful in OU with rain support, but suffers from the presence of <a href="/bw/moves/mach_punch">Mach Punch</a> users such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/breloom">Breloom</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/conkeldurr">Conkeldurr</a>.</p>
