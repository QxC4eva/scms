[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The user spends three turns locked into this move. On the first of the three turns, all sleeping active Pokemon wake up. During the three turns, no active Pokemon can fall asleep by any means; Pokemon switched in during the effect do not wake up. If the user is prevented from moving or the attack is not successful against the target during one of the turns, the effect ends. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There isn't much use for this move. It's a Normal-type attack that also happens to lock the user in, which are two very undesirable traits indeed. Being locked on a Normal-type attack means a free switch for any Pokemon that resists or is immune to it. In a competitive match you shouldn't give that kind of room to your opponent.</p>
