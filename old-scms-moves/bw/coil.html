<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack, Defense, and accuracy by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>One of the new boosting moves introduced in the fifth generation, Coil raises three different stats in the same turn. It works similar to Bulk Up, so has a more defensive approach, the difference being that since it raises accuracy as well makes possible for the user to use hard hitting moves, which would have normally bad accuracy, with more success.</p>
