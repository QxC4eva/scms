<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If holder's current species is Clamperl, its Special Defense is doubled.</p>

<p>When a Clamperl is traded while holding this item, it evolves into <a href="/dp/pokemon/gorebyss">Gorebyss</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>DeepSeaScale is a very overlooked item on Clamperl, as it doesn't increase any of Clamperl's offensive stats; instead, it raises Clamperl's decent Special Defense. In UU, Clamperl's below average Special Defense raises to a considerably high 458 when maximized. On the other hand, Clamperl's Special Defense of 16 in the Little Cup metagame shoots up to a high 32, which is unheard of in the Little Cup metagame. Even though DeepSeaScale enhances Clamperl's hit-taking ability on the special side, its mediocre HP and access to no reliable recovery move outside of Rest really hinders it in both metagames; not to mention its pathetic Speed. Using DeepSeaTooth is almost always the better item to use, as the end result is more satisfying.</p>
