Overview
########

    Only useful on dedicated Baton Pass teams
    Nearly mandatory on these teams because it is the only Pokemon in the game that has Soundproof + Baton Pass, so it is the only way to stop Perish Song from ruining the chain
    New Fairy typing gives it a fantastic immunity to Dragon Tail in addition to its previous immunity to Roar, so it can only be phazed by Whirlwind

Moves
========

    Mr. Mime is only viable on full Baton Pass teams, so naturally Baton Pass is by far its most important move.
    Substitute is also mandatory, as it protects Mr. Mime and its teammates from status effects, random critical hits, and Leech Seed, which would all cause major issues otherwise.
    Calm Mind is Mr. Mime's most reliable way of boosting its stats. After a few Calm Mind Boosts, most special attackers will be unable to touch it.
    Encore is useful because it can give Mr. Mime many free setup opportunities, especially if it encores the opponent into Roar, Perish Song, Bug Buzz, or a Dragon-type move, none of which affect it.


Set Details
========

    Leftovers are the preferred item because Mr. Mime really needs to stay as healthy as possible in order to make as many Substitutes as it needs to.
    The given EVs are used to outspeed Taunt Deoxys-S at +2 Speed. This also allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp at +2, which is important. The rest of the EVs are thrown into HP and Special Defense because all common Perish Song users in OU are special attackers. With the listed spread, Mr. Mime is able to survive a hit from any potential Perish Song user except Choice Specs Politoed, which is very rare. However, Mr. Mime can still switch into it if it has a substitute or a Special Defense boost up, scout its set, and safely Baton Pass out to a teammate such as Vaporeon.


Usage Tips
========

    Baton Pass to Mr. Mime whenever the opponent has a potential Perish Song user out on the field. The only common users in OU are Politoed and Celebi.
    Mr. Mime is only immune to the move itself, not the actual Perish counter. Because of this, Baton Passing to Mr. Mime after Perish Song has been used does not stop perish Song from working. Luckily, nearly all common users of Perish Song are special attackers, so this isn't a major issue.
    If your opponent has a potential Perish Song user on their team, keeping Mr. Mime healthy is crucial because it must be counted on to switch in on a moment's notice.
    Knowing when to Baton Pass to Espeon is crucial, because just one Whirlwind or Taunt is nearly always fatal. Whenever there is a slight chance of such a move being used, you need to Baton Pass to Espeon. Prankster Taunt users are especially tricky, since you need to pass to Espeon the turn before they switch in, which can be very difficult to predict.
    Even in the likely scenario that the opponent does not have a Pokemon that learns Perish Song on their team, Mr. Mime is far from useless. Its excellent Special Defense stat and Encore both allow it to have quite a few opportunities to set up with Calm Mind.


Team Options
========

    Espeon is a non-negotiable member of any full Baton Pass team. Its Magic Bounce ability is the only way Baton Pass teams have around Taunt and Whirlwind outside of the one-time use Mental Herb item and the rather unreliable Ingrain Smeargle, respectively. It also helps in protecting the team from other miscellaneous moves such as Encore, and status-inducing moves. Using a Baton Pass team without Espeon is not recommended.
    Scolipede is another crucial member of Baton Pass teams. Its ability, Speed Boost, makes it by far the most reliable method of passing Speed boosts. It is essential for Baton Pass teams to outspeed the opponent in order to make sure the right Pokemon is always out on the field. Scolipede can also pass Substitutes, Iron Defense boosts, and Swords Dance boosts.
    Vaporeon is another Baton Pass staple with its boosting move of choice, Acid Armor, great defensive stats and typing, and useful ability in Water Absorb.
    Mawile makes for a good teammate because of its excellent typing, great boosting moves in Iron Defense and Swords Dance, and useful Intimidate ability.
    Mega Scizor is very similar to Mawile in that it is a Steel-type with Iron Defense and Swords Dance. Its main draws over Mawile are its access to reliable recovery in Roost, and most importantly, its Technician Bullet Punch, which makes it one of the only ways Baton Pass teams have of beating Unaware Clefable.
    Celebi
    Zapdos
    Mew
    Smeargle is the only Pokemon in the game with both Ingrain and Baton Pass. As such, it is a useful Pokemon on Baton Pass teams in order to protect the entire team from phasing while recovering a slight bit of health each turn. This takes a ton of pressure off of Mr. Mime and Espeon, as they are otherwise the only way to stop phazers from wrecking Baton Pass chains.

Other Options
########

    Psyshock allows Mr. Mime to beat Haze Tentacruel one one one, which otherwise puts a full stop to Baton Pass teams.
    Magic Coat is an option over Encore in order to reflect certain moves such as Toxic or Encore. Its main draw, however, is its ability to reflect Prankster Taunt, which would otherwise be a major pain to deal with.
    Barrier is another boosting move in Mr. Mime's arsenal, but Mr. Mime's downright horrific physical bulk makes Calm Mind the better choice in nearly every situation.
    Dazzling Gleam can be used if one desires an attacking move on Mr. Mime. Its biggest draw is that it hits Sableye, a major headache for Baton Pass teams, super effectively. However, the utility provided by Encore is usually too good to pass up.


Checks & Counters
########

    Taunt, especially priority Taunt from Prankster users such as Thundurus, Mega Banette, or Sableye, can prevent Mr. Mime and its teammates from doing much of anything. Prankster Taunt users in particular can always get a Taunt off before the opponent can Baton a Pass to Espeon to bounce it back.
    Haze is gets rid of all hard earned stat boosts. In addition, it is completely unblock able outside of Taunt, which is nearly impossible to fit on a moveset of any Pokemon on Baton Pass teams. However, it is an incredibly rare move, with Tentacruel being the only user of the move in OU.
    Phazing is an issue for Baton Pass teams, though Mr. Mime itself is only affected by Whirlwind and Espeon is only affected by Dragon Tail. Common Whirlwind users include Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Hippowdon.
    Strong physical attackers are a huge problem for Mr. Mime because of its terrible physical bulk. Scizor in particular easily OHKOes Mr. Mime with Bullet Punch.
    Unaware Clefable and Quagsire wall Baton Pass teams to no end as they generally lack significant offensive presence. Clefable in particular can set up Calm Minds on most common Baton Pass Pokemon without fear.
