<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/488.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Dialga</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 240 HP / 238 SpA / 32 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Aura Sphere<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Thunder</p>

<p>Specs Dialga is way better than people give it credit for and is an excellent starter capable of OHKOing all of the common Uber starters which include opposing Dialga, Palkia, Scarf Kyogre, Lati@s and Groudon. The speed evs are enough to outspeed most base 90 speed pokemon who do not run any evs in speed. Draco Meteor is Dialga's hardest hitting move but because of the Special Attack drop it gives i've decided to replace the standard Fire Blast with Dragon Pulse for consistency. Fire is generally a bad attacking type in the Uber metagame due to a fair amount of pokemon resisting it and Thunder already 2HKOs most steels so not much of a problem in dropping Fire Blast as far as i can see.</p>

<p><strong>Lugia</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 208 HP / 166 Def / 136 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Reflect<br />
- Roost<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Ice Beam</p>

<p>My Groudon and Rayquaza "counter" right here. The speed Evs alow it to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza as well as any neutral nature base 90 pokemon like Groudon and Kyogre. I initially thought about going with enough evs to outspeed Jolly Ray as it is the most common but it would force Lugia to sacrifice too much from its defenses. The current ev spread takes 66-78% from a Jolly Rayquaza's Life Orbed Dragon Danced Outrage so it can still possibly survive even after Stealth Rock Damage and generally will always survive if it switches into Ray's DDance with Max Hp due to Leftovers recovery. Lugia also serves as my Normal Arceus counter as with Reflect and Toxic it can outstall and beat Arceus before it is able to kill Lugia, even if Arceus attempts to Sword Dances 3 times. Pressure also benefits Lugia here as it eats up Arceus' Extremespeed and Groudon's Stone Edge pp.</p>

<p><strong>Palkia</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 36 Atk / 252 SpA / 222 Spe<br />
Hasty Nature<br />
- Spacial Rend<br />
- Surf<br />
- Thunder<br />
- Focus Punch</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Palkia, my second answer to Rayquaza if Luga is taken out, it has enough speed to outpace Jolly Rayquaza after a Dragon Dance and can Spacial Rend it for the OHKO. It also serves as a great revenge killer for Scarf Ogre, Mewtwo and Darkrai who think they will outspeed it for the kill, Focus Punch does about 73-85% to Blissey who think they can wall it indefinitely so they also have to be wary when switching into this threat. Not much else to say </p>

<p><strong>Blissey</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 70 HP / 252 Def / 188 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Softboiled<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Wish</p>

<p>Best special wall in OU does it just as well in Ubers. Toxic is my main method of dealing damage and Seismic Toss serves as a consistent way of dealing damage. I previously had Ice Beam over Wish but given the nature of the team i decided using Wish on Blissey was definitely the way to go. Most would argue that Protect would be a better choice over Softboiled, but i'm more comfortable with Softboiled for instant recovery and its replacement is not debatable.</p>

<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>Choice Band Tyranitar, a very uncommon but deadly threat in Ubers due to its ability to hit alot of Ubers against their lower Defensive stat. It also sets up Sandstorm for the last member of by team and for the most part eliminates his counters. Tar is my answer to Lati@s and to Choiced Mewtwos beating them with Crunch if they get any ideas of staying in and Pursuit if they had any ideas of switching. I'm still contemplating its Ev spread though and haven't decided yet if Careful would be a better choice over Adamant to take better advantage of the Sandstorm boost but i haven't run into any problems with it so far.</p>

<p><strong>Garchomp</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Sand Veil<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Dragon Claw</p>

<p>The star of the team It's.........**Garchomp**. Now for all those that think Garchomp is terrible in Ubers, I personally think you have never played Ubers before and will blatantly disregard your opnions and statements. Choice Band Garchomp is indeed a serious threat outspeeding more of the Uber metagame than you would expect. Darkrai, Mewtwo, Deoxys - A and the Latis are the only things that outspeed Garchomp in Ubers excluding Scarfed Pokemon and the Lati's actually tend to run less than 333 speed as their main opponent to outspeed is Palkia, Stone Edge is listed to possibly 2hko Lugia and Dragon Claw is listed over Fire Fang for picking off weaker targets if i dont want to lock myself into a Outrage or Cb Earthquake. Bronzong, Forry and Skarm arent all too common in Ubers so i see little reason to run a Fire move.</p>
