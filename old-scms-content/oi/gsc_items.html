<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Collecting items is a fundamental part of playing Pokemon. In most cases, collecting an item is as simple as finding it on the ground and picking it up. It isn't always this easy, however, as there are many items that are hidden from view. These items will often get overlooked unless you either have prior knowledge of the item or just happen to use an item-locating device in the right location. This guide will show you where you can find every hidden item in Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal.</p>

<h2>The Itemfinder</h2>

<p>The Itemfinder is a key item that allows you to detect nearby hidden items. If you are following this guide, then you probably won't need to use the Itemfinder to find the majority of the items, but it can still be helpful for certain areas, such as the Whirl Islands, where the items tend to lack clear reference points for pinpointing them. The Itemfinder can even be used to confirm that you have already collected an item if you begin using this guide partway through the game.</p>

<p>To get the Itemfinder, head to Ecruteak City and enter the house east of the Gym. Talk to the boy inside and answer "Yes" to his question to get the Itemfinder. The GSC Itemfinder is not able to pinpoint hidden items; however, it will make a sound if there is a hidden item on the screen somewhere. Once the Itemfinder does its work, you'll have to search for the exact location of the item yourself.</p>

<h2>Hidden Items</h2>

<p>Note that the items are listed in a rough order based on when players can access them. Because the games tend to become less linear as you progress, some items listed further down in this guide might be obtained before items listed above them, depending on what order you prefer to complete each task. Therefore, don't feel obliged to follow the order of this guide exactly if you prefer to do things in a different order to what is presented here.</p>

<p>Moon Stone: Note that you can only get this item on Monday nights, and that you will need Rock Smash to get it. On Monday night, enter the area with a Pokemon with Rock Smash and approach the grass square on the left side. An event involving two Clefairy dancing around a rock will occur. When the Clefairy spot you and flee, Smash the rock and check the tile underneath for a Moon Stone. Note that if you leave the area before activating the event (or you activate the event but leave before Smashing the rock and collecting the item), the event will not occur again until the following Monday night (hence why it is important that you have Rock Smash ready before actually entering Mt. Moon Square).</p>
