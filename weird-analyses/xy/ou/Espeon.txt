Overview
########

Espeon is, in a word, outclassed. Nearly every role Espeon can fulfill, is better done by another Pokemon. Espeon's main competitor is Deoxys-S, which is better in both offensive and supportive roles, boasting much higher Speed, superior coverage, and access to Stealth Rock. Magic Bounce is a solid ability, but Espeon struggles to make good use of it because of its frailty and poor defensive typing. However, Espeon has its uses in the OU metagame. It is great at shutting down Deoxys-D and other hyper offense leads, and can prevent Stealth Rock from going up simply by being on the field. It also single-handedly makes dedicated Baton Pass teams viable with its ability. All in all, while there is generally very little reason to use Espeon in OU, it still manages to carve itself a small niche.


Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Light Screen
move 2: Reflect
move 3: Baton Pass
move 4: Yawn / Psychic / Psyshock
ability: Magic Bounce
item: Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Espeon can support sweepers weak to Stealth Rock with Light Screen, Reflect, and Magic Bounce, giving them a much easier time setting up and keeping entry hazards off the field. Baton Pass is useful because it maintains momentum and helps to make the most of the eight turns that Light Screen and Reflect last. It also allows Espeon to escape Pursuit from the likes of Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Aegislash. Hidden Power Fighting can be used over Baton Pass to surprise and OHKO unsuspecting Bisharp, but it has little use otherwise. Yawn might sound gimmicky at first, but it is great for forcing switches and allowing a sweeper to come in for free. It also prevents Espeon from becoming setup fodder. Espeon can also run Psychic for a STAB attack to defend itself with. However, Espeon is fairly weak without investment or a boosting item, so the move isn't all that useful. Additionally, if Espeon does not run Yawn, there is little reason to use it over Deoxys-S. Psyshock hits special walls harder than Psychic does, but Espeon cannot deal much damage to defensive Pokemon due to its lack of power.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment makes full use of Espeon's good Speed stat, allowing it outspeed threats like Keldeo and Terrakion. Max HP gives Espeon much-needed bulk, important for setting up screens. Light Clay is a must, as it extends the number of turns that Light Screen and Reflect are active.

Usage Tips
========

It is usually best to lead with Espeon in order to get dual screens up as early as possible, especially against teams with Deoxys-D or Deoxys-S. However, Espeon can switch in on Pokemon that are hazard setters or can't do much to it and proceed to set up screens. It is usually best to set up Reflect first, as it patches up Espeon's pathetic Defense stat and generally allows it to set up both screens much more easily. After screens have been set up, immediately switch or Baton Pass to a sweeper in order to take advantage of them. If the opposing Pokemon threatens to set up on Espeon, Yawn can be used to force it out and gain momentum with Baton Pass or an opportunity to set up. It is often better to use Yawn and let Espeon faint after setting up screens than keep it around, as this way you can maintain momentum much more easily.

Team Options
========

This set should be used in conjunction with setup sweepers weak to Stealth Rock to give them an easy time setting up. However, if Espeon's partners are not weak to Stealth Rock, Deoxys-S is a much better dual screens setter. Mega Charizard X abhors Stealth Rock and is fairly bulky, so it is a good teammate for this set. Mega Pinsir, Bulk Up Talonflame, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Volcarona are also good partners for the same reasons. Keldeo is a good partner for this set because it can easily deal with the Dark-types that often switch in on Espeon. Terrakion is similar in this regard and loves getting a Justified boost when it switches into a Dark-type move.


Baton Pass
########
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Stored Power
move 3: Morning Sun / Substitute
move 4: Dazzling Gleam
ability: Magic Bounce
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Baton Pass is mandatory, as it is what allows this set to work. Stored Power reaches a frighteningly high Base Power after enough boosts are accrued, allowing Espeon to sweep late-game. Morning Sun is used to keep Espeon healthy, as it is passed to often throughout the match. Substitute can be used in case a teammate's Substitute is broken, but cutting down on Espeon's health is rarely a good idea. Dazzling Gleam hits the Dark-types immune to Stored Power for super effective damage, particularly Sableye, the greatest enemy to Baton Pass teams.

Set Details
========

Max Defense and HP investment is run, as Espeon needs to be as bulky as possible in order to switch into opposing Pokemon, with the goal of bouncing back phazing moves or Taunts. Similarly, Leftovers is the preferred item as it allows Espeon to remain healthy without relying too much on Morning Sun.

Usage Tips
========

This set is only useful on dedicated Baton Pass teams. Espeon is by far the most useful Pokemon on any full Baton Pass team, and is in fact what makes such teams viable. Espeon has two crucial roles on full Baton Pass teams. The most important of these roles stems from Espeon's immunity to moves that would otherwise stop Baton Pass teams dead in their tracks, which include Whirlwind, Taunt, Roar, and Encore. The second role it plays is that of a sweeper, as Stored Power is ridiculously strong after a few boosts and is even capable of destroying Pokemon that resist it. Only attempt to sweep when Espeon has enough boosts, particularly in Speed, Defense, and Special Defense, as it might end up having to take multiple priority hits. Baton Pass to Espeon whenever you predict a phazing move, Taunt, or Encore is on the way, as it is nearly impossible to recover after being hit by one of these moves. Be sure tohave a Substitute up always, as it is the only way to protect Espeon and its teammates from critical hits. It also blocks status-inducing moves and Leech Seed. As a general rule, don't let Espeon get KOed, as it's crucial to its team's success.

Team Options
========

Scolipede is nearly mandatory on Baton Pass teams, as it can reliably pass Speed boosts and can pass Defense boosts with Iron Defense. Mr. Mime is another important Pokemon, as it is immune to Perish Song, and has handy immunities to Roar, Dragon Tail, and Bug Buzz. Mr. Mime is far from useless outside of its immunities, though, as it can Baton Pass Calm Mind boosts and Substitutes, and has access to the ever-handy Encore. Vaporeon can be a good partner, as it has a useful immunity to Water-type moves, can boost its Defense with Acid Armor, has great defensive stats, and possesses a good typing. Mew has a plethora of boosting moves, including Calm Mind, Iron Defense, and most notably, Amnesia. Celebi has a useful defensive typing and access to Calm Mind, though its multitude of common weaknesses can hold it back, especially its weakness to Flying-type attacks. Zapdos has a great typing and can boost with Charge or Agility. Scizor is a very helpful teammate as it is great at defeating Unaware Clefable, which otherwise laughs at Baton Pass teams, and can boost with Iron Defense and Swords Dance. Mawile is the only Pokemon in the game with the combination of Intimidate and Baton Pass, has a fantastic typing, and can pass Iron Defense and Swords Dance boosts. Smeargle can learn every move in the game, but Ingrain is the only reason to use it, as the move gives the entire team an incredibly useful immunity to Roar and Whirlwind, decreasing the pressure on Espeon and Mr. Mime. Furthermore, it has a handy health-restoring effect. However, Smeargle has pitiful bulk and is very matchup dependent, as it is completely useless against common leads such as Deoxys-D.


Other Options
########

Espeon can run an offensive set, but it faces harsh competition from a plethora of other Psychic-types, mainly Deoxys-S, Latios, and Alakazam, all of which outclass offensive Espeon for one reason or another. In addition, such a set is easily walled by common Pokemon and fares even worse against Espeon's usual checks and counters. Because it has such glaring flaws and is outclassed by so many Pokemon, offensive Espeon is rarely, if ever, worth using. While a Calm Mind set may seem appealing at first due to Espeon's good Special Attack and Speed stats as well as its immunity to Roar and Whirlwind, it is actually a terrible option. Calm Mind Espeon struggles against many common opponents due to its awful physical bulk, bad defensive typing, and susceptibility to nearly every common form of priority in the OU tier.


Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Dark-types, particularly Tyranitar, Bisharp, Mandibuzz, and Greninja, are a huge issue for Espeon, as they can easily KO Espeon with their strong STAB moves. In addition, they are immune to Stored Power and can impede Espeon's sweep. However, many of them take quite a bit of damage from a boosted Dazzling Gleam.

**Aegislash**: Aegislash crumbles Espeon with little effort. It can OHKO with Shadow Ball, 2HKO with Shadow Sneak, and trap Espeon with Pursuit. Aegislash also takes very little damage from any of Espeon's attacks save for a highly boosted Stored Power.

**Scizor**: Scizor can easily come in on Espeon and gain momentum or flat-out OHKO it with U-turn. It can also pick off weakened Espeon with Bullet Punch.

**Physical Attackers**: Espeon has awful physical bulk, so most physical attackers can easily 2HKO or even OHKO it with a neutral STAB move. Examples include Talonflame, Garchomp, and Excadrill. Additionally, Baton Pass teams as a whole struggle when pressured by powerful attackers such as Choice Band Staraptor and Mega Heracross, the latter of which can bypass Substitutes with its multi-hit moves.

**Prankster Taunt**: While they obviously don't beat Espeon itself, Prankster Taunt users such as Thundurus and Sableye are a huge problem for Baton Pass teams.
