<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Restores 10 HP when the holder of this item is at 50% HP or less. One-time use. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Poison-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In tiers capitalizing on level 100 Pokemon, Oran Berry is, in every way, outclassed by Leftovers and even Sitrus Berry due to these Pokemon having high HP stats. However, Oran Berry has a comfortable place in Little Cup, where unevolved level 5 Pokemon can instantly recover most of their lost health when the Berry is consumed. Because of this, Oran Berry is a solid staple item for both offensive and defensive threats. While there's no denying Leftovers is still a useful item for some Pokemon in Little Cup, Oran Berry heals a much larger amount of health at one time, potentially making 2HKOes into 3HKOes. For example, Bagon makes great use of Oran Berry due to maintaining its health (after consumption) and having a Dragon Dance boost ready, while Munchlax can instantly start a healing cycle after its health is restored.</p>
