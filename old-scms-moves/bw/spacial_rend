Has a high critical hit rate.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a critical hit rate one stage higher than normal. Assuming there are no other critical hit modifiers in play, this move has a 1/8 chance to get a critical hit instead of a 1/16 chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Unlike Roar of Time, Dialga's pitiful excuse for a signature move, Spacial Rend is quite useful. The step up in Base Power from Dragon Pulse to Spacial Rend is small, but helps Palkia a great deal in ripping through your opponent's Pokemon. The low PP can hurt in a metagame jam-packed with Pressure users, but this doesn't ruin the move in the slightest. Feel free to throw Spacial Rend onto any Palkia set for nice, reliable STAB.</p>
