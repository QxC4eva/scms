[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder takes no damage from allies in double and triple battles, even if the move is specifically targeted at the wielder.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Moves that damage teammates in double and triple battles are few and far between, but in the case of attacks that hit the entire field, such as <a href="/bw/moves/earthquake">Earthquake</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/explosion">Explosion</a>, this can be a useful ability to have. Otherwise, there are better options for each Pokemon that obtains it. This ability should never be used in singles.</p>
