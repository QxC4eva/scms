Overview
########

Back from a generation's worth of pillaging and plundering, Kyurem-W returns to the legendary battlefield of Ubers with a blazing fury and a cold-hearted soul. With a massive 170 Special Attack stat and a great Ice / Dragon offensive typing, Kyurem-W is one of the exemplary wallbreakers in the tier, packing the most powerful Draco Meteor in the game as insurance. Its bulk is also solid, as 125/90/100 defenses is nothing to scoff at by wallbreaker standards, backed with a good base 95 Speed and a great ability in Turboblaze, letting it break past Multiscale, Levitate, and Flash Fire. Also, its Stealth Rock weakness is less of an issue with the advent of Defog, but still can hold it back at times. In addition, it has good albeit few resistances to Water, Electric, and Grass, which are common STAB or coverage moves, opening switch-in opportunities. Despite this, Kyurem-W returns to a tier where Fairy-types like Xerneas, Fairy Arceus, and Sylveon run amok, punishing it from hitting the nuke button without rational thought like it once did before. While its typing is good offensively, it is horrible defensively, preventing it from synergizing well with teams and leaving it weak to common attacking types such as Fighting, Dragon, Steel, and Fairy. Though its Speed gives it an advantage against the crowded 90 Speed tier, it still gets outsped by threats like Palkia and Genesect. Its movepool is also sparse outside of its coverage moves, preventing it from performing different roles. Also, to top it all off, all of its reliable moves were nerfed bar Fusion Flare, noticeably decreasing its power. Still, don't disregard the threat that is Kyurem-W, and tread lightly if you wish to prevent your defenses from being smashed.

Moves
========

When Kyurem-W is equipped with Choice Specs, it's already best offensive capability turns into a record-breaking 723 Special Attack stat with a Modest nature, letting Kyurem-W's Specs Draco Meteor deal massive damage, leaving only the pink blobs, Fairy-types and the bulkiest of Steel-types able to take the hit well, which is Kyurem-W's signature selling point. Specs Ice Beam is a spammable STAB move that Kyurem-W can fall back upon when needed, and will shatter walls like Lugia, Groudon, Specially Defensive Yveltal, Grass Arceus, Ground Arceus, and Gliscor. Specs Fusion Flare lets Kyurem-W break past the multitude of Steel-types built to deal with wallbreakers like it, severely damaging Aegislash, Jirachi, Steel Arceus, and Bronzong outside of rain, and will literally hurl Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Genesect into the Sun. Specs Focus Blast is Kyurem-W's only way of getting past Blissey and Chansey, as it 2HKO's both after Stealth Rock, and can break past lot of Fighting-weak Pokemon such as the ubiquitous Extreme Killer, Mega-Kangaskhan, Rock Arceus and Dialga; Tyranitar too will not have a chance of surviving unless it has an Assault Vest. However, if you want extra insurance against Steel-types when Kyogre is present in addition to perfect neutral coverage, Earth Power fits the bill quite nicely, and can reliably kill both Zekrom and Mega Charizard X if you don't want to use Draco Meteor, and will usually OHKO Heatran without fail.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack EVs are vital to Kyurem-W's success as a wallbreaker, as the primary thing that differentiates it from competing Dragons is that is has the highest Special Attack out of all of them. Due to Kyurem-W's weakness to Stealth Rock, 4 Defense EVs let it take an odd number of damage when switching into it, as being able to come in an extra time can make all the difference in a heated battle. 252 Speed EVs let Kyurem-W speed tie with the standard Swords Dance Rayquaza sets, but running Timid lets you avoid that speed tie entirely and dispose of Rayquaza with Specs Ice Beam. Timid has other pros over Modest, like being able to outspeed positive base 90's, taking advantage of Kyurem-W's relatively solid speed tier, but Kyurem-W misses out on some important OHKO's with Specs Draco Meteor in the process, such as against 252 HP Arceus after Stealth Rock, in addition to being able to 2HKO the blobs after Stealth Rock. However, if Kyurem-W's bulk interests you, a spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA with Modest can let Kyurem-W stay in the match longer, and only misses the ability to outspeed 2 walls he can break: Lugia and Yveltal.

Usage Tips
========

Even though using Specs Draco Meteor right off the bat is very enticing, be very careful when using it if Xerneas is still alive and kicking or if your opponent's Arceus forme has not been revealed yet, as it could open up either set up opportunities or a possible Defog to get rid of your hard-earned Stealth Rocks. If you do not have Stealth Rock up and are not running Focus Blast, defeating the blobs is a no-go, so have a teammate to do the dirty work for you if you don't run these. Though prediction is very important for any Choice user, Kyurem-W is hard-pressed when using it as its primary STAB has an immunity now, and if a Fairy is waiting in the wings and you predict correctly, Kyurem-W can damage beyond repair bulky sweepers expecting a Specs Draco Meteor. Even though Kyurem-W's bulk is impressive, it has next to no resistances to take advantage of it, so switch in at your own risk. However, Kyurem-W can find opportunities to switch in against defensive walls or entry hazard setters (such as Groudon and Landorus-T) and rip them to pieces, and doesn't mind getting poisoned or burned, so play aggressively against defensively oriented teams, as Kyurem-W is one of the best Pokemon to use against most stall teams. Try fitting Kyurem-W on teams that have trouble breaking past tough nuts to crack such as the Great Walls (Giratina and Lugia crumble against Kyurem-W), the pink blobs, and a lot of other utility walls that halt the progress of sweepers, as Kyurem-W excels against walls as mentioned before.

Team Options
========

Though Kyurem-W's power is great, it's still not a one-man demolition crew. An example of this is not having the stuff needed to kill the blobs, which stallbreakers like Yveltal or powerful Fighting-types can help deal with this. Mega Gengar can trap most Arceus forms and Fairies that give Kyurem-W trouble, and it can give Kyurem an opportunity to switch in when it cripples a wall with Taunt. VoltTurn is a good option if switching in Kyurem-W is an issue, letting it come in on a predicted switch with little risk involved provided entry hazards are not present. Ho-Oh is another problem Kyurem-W has to deal with, but keeping Stealth Rock on the field (Kyurem-W scares away most Defog users), having a counter to it (such as Rock Arceus), or sending out a team member carrying Stone Edge can solve this problem quickly. Keeping Stealth Rock off the field is a priority in order for Kyurem-W to switch in without losing a chunk of its health, so Defog users like Arceus, Giratina, and Lugia can clear all hazards or Dual Screens while spinners like Excadrill and Forretress can maintain entry hazard control on your side only. Spinning is the superior choice, as having Stealth Rock up lets Kyurem-W do crazy things with Specs Draco Meteor, such as having a chance to OHKO 252 HP Arceus, OHKO Ho-Oh, and 2HKO the blobs with Focus Blast. Excadrill can both spin and lay Stealth Rock, compounding both together, while hazard setters like Groudon, Landorus-T, and Dialga can add them reliably at almost any point in the match. Finally, have a fallback plan against sweepers if you decide to Draco Meteor, as Kyurem-W will be forced out, giving set up opportunities to sweepers like Extreme Killer and Geomancy / Calm Mind Xerneas. Skarmory and Physically Defensive Yveltal can deal with Extreme Killer, while stuff like Ho-Oh, Jirachi, Bronzong, and Aegislash can take on Xerneas.

Choice-less
########
name: Choice-less
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Fusion Flare / Toxic
move: 4: Roost / Substitute / Focus Blast
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
evs: 252 Spe / 252 SpA / 4 Def
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Though the temptation of Choice Specs is strong, Kyurem-W can definitely function as a choice-less variant if you like the ability to switch moves. Draco Meteor still hurts even without a Choice Specs boost anyway. Ice Beam is still as reliable a STAB move as ever, and with the freedom to switch moves, Kyurem-W can still considerably damage Lugia, Yveltal, and other Pokemon 4x weak to Ice. Fusion Flare still helps Kyurem-W against Steel-types, and even without Earth Power, Turboblaze bypasses Heatran's Flash Fire, preventing the magma quadraped from escaping a fiery fate. Toxic lets you get past bulky attackers and walls that attempt to stop your rampage, and prevents Ho-oh, the pink blobs, and Water Arceus / Electric Arceus from walling this set entirely. Roost lets Kyurem-W stay in the match for a significantly longer period of time and heals off residual damage and Life Orb recoil quickly, in addition to helping Kyurem-W reliably stall out the aforementioned Toxic targets. Kyurem-W can also utilize Substitute in conjunction with Leftovers similarly to its brother, Kyurem-B, shielding Kyurem-W from damage and possible status, scouting out coverage moves, and letting Kyurem-W sweep from behind cover. Focus Blast still damages the targets it's supposed to well enough factoring out Blissey and Chansey, and can still do similar damage in comparison to Choice Specs if Life Orb is used with it. Stone Edge can be used to kill standard Ho-Oh sets if Life Orb is chosen, as it can still KO with Life Orb even if Kyurem-W has no Attack investment and an Attack decreasing nature.

Set Details
========

Timid is best used with Life Orb, letting Kyurem-W outspeed positive base 90's while still maintaining the power of a Modest nature, but Leftovers should be used with Modest, as Kyurem-W needs to compensate for the power drop in exchange for more longevity, but since the metagame has slowed down somewhat, running a Modest nature can still work acceptably most of the time. Also, keep in mind that you can stall out Calm Mind Electric Arceus and Water Arceus with Toxic+Roost and Leftovers, 2 very potent checks that will force you out otherwise. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA with a Modest nature with Roost, Substitute, Leftovers, or Toxic can be used to help Kyurem-W possibly stall out most of its defensive checks and still take advantage of Kyurem-W's good bulk. One important thing to consider when running Choice-less Kyurem-W is that with the cramped coverage options, the specific checks / counters that correspond with their specific coverage moves (ex. Steel-types weak to Fusion Flare), can either be easily taken down or be impossible to break past. With the respective non-damaging moves and the items, the goals of the set change from all-out-attacking to sweeping / cleaning to outstalling walls etc., so the set changes dynamically depending on what you run.

Usage Tips
========

If you are using Life Orb with Roost, or just Roost in general, try switching into something you can force out, and proceed to heal off the damage as they switch. However, if you do not need to Roost off damage, try to predict the switch well enough that you can backhand the next thing that comes in with the correct coverage move or Toxic. The same situation applies with Substitute, and has the added utility of scouting out threatening attacks without fretting. Despite Kyurem-W having to play it safe with Draco Meteor, try to play aggressively as you can, as the switches it can force give it an opportunity to either set up a Substitute or severely damage an incoming sweeper. As mentioned before, be very careful when using Draco Meteor, as giving an opportunity for Fairies to come in or being immediately forced out the next turn is not fun in the slightest.

Team Options
========

Despite the power drop from lack of Choice Specs, Stealth Rock is not as needed this time around, as Kyurem-W misses out on most of the OHKO's it once had anyway. However, Kyurem-W still appreciates it, as it can OHKO 252 /80 Ho-Oh with a Timid Life Orb Draco Meteor if the pebbles are in play. Groudon suits this role the best, as it can not only cripple stuff with Thunder Wave and Toxic to make Kyurem-W's life easier, but it can bestow upon it a sun-boosted Fusion Flare, which is invaluable in damaging Steel-types. Landorus-T can also set up Stealth Rock, and can bring Kyurem-W in with U-turn. As Kyurem-W dislikes Stealth Rock on your playing field, Rapid Spinners like Forretress and Excadrill keep them away from it. Defog can also work in this situation, but Kyurem-W likes to utilize entry hazards to help it do damage. Sticky Web and/or SmashPass support can be used to assist Kyurem-W in sweeping or cleaning. Smeargle can do either of these, or even both, and doesn't bother team synergy too much if it is a hyper offense team. Outside of this, Kyurem-W has the same checks and counters regardless of what it runs, so all the team members mentioned previously don't change in their effectiveness when paired with Kyurem-W.

Other Options
########

Flash Cannon is an option if Fairies are troublesome for your team, and the Specs set can OHKO standard offensive Xerneas with it after Stealth Rock, but doesn't hit anything useful outside of Fairies. Dragon Pulse can be used if getting forced out by Draco Meteor just isn't your style, but the power drop is significant, and Kyurem-W wants to have that power the Draco Meteor provides. Blizzard is an alternative to Ice Beam, as its sheer power is good enough. However, it needs Hail support in order to be spammed reliably, and usually isn't worth the trouble. Ancient Power is an option to hit Ho-Oh on the special side, and the boost can let you sweep, but doesn't do that much damage to other Pokemon besides Ho-Oh, so Stone Edge is generally the superior choice. A Choice Scarf set can let Kyurem-W revenge kill with its power, but it cannot gain momentum, it has a Stealth Rock weakness, and shouldn't be locking itself into a weaker Draco Meteor with all these Fairies. Finally, an Assault Vest can be used to increase Kyurem-W's bulk and tanking capabilities, but Kyurem-W likes having a boosting item, and can't use moves like Substitute or Roost.

Checks and Counters
########
**Pink Blobs**: Pretty much the only things that can switch in safely against Kyurem-W, Blissey and Chansey can reliably wall Kyurem-W with their titanic special bulk. However, if Specs Kyurem-W carries Focus Blast and Stealth Rock is up, neither of them can switch in whatsoever without being 2HKO'd.

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Fairy Arceus, and Sylveon can all either defeat Kyurem-W with super-effective Fairy attacks or prevent it from spamming Draco Meteor freely with the fear of being used as setup fodder (Xerneas) or for support opportunities (all 3 of them), but only Sylveon can switch into Specs Ice Beam or Specs Fusion Flare unless Stealth Rock is up.

**Ho-Oh**: If Stealth Rock is not up, Ho-Oh can stall out Kyurem-W with Roost due to it being able to stomach at least one Specs Draco Meteor, and finish it off at its leisure with Brave Bird.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Steel-types not 4x weak to Fusion Flare such as Aegislash, Jirachi, Steel Arceus, and Bronzong can check Kyurem-W well, especially if rain is up, but must switch in with caution if Kyurem-W carries Earth Power.

**Scizor**: Despite being 4x weak to Fusion Flare, Scizor can effectively check Kyurem-W due to it resisting all of its other coverage moves and pick it off with Technician Bullet Punch.

**Specially Defensive Water-types**: Bulky Water-types like specially defensive Kyogre and Water Arceus can stomach relatively all of Kyurem-W's coverage moves bar Draco Meteor, especially in rain, and either stall it out with Rest (Kyogre) or Recover (Arceus-Water), or just phaze it out with Roar.

**Rock Arceus**: Though disposed of quickly with Focus Blast or Earth Power, Rock Arceus can switch in on Fusion Flare and can threaten to 2HKO with a Rock-type Judgment.

**Calm Mind Arceus not weak to Kyurem-W's coverage moves**: Though very broad at first, the primary threats that encompass this are Electric Arceus and Ghost Arceus. Electric Arceus can't switch into Earth Power and neither can switch into Specs Draco Meteor, but otherwise both can set up Calm Minds in Kyurem-W's face or just force it out if it lacks Roost+Toxic

**Faster Pokemon with super effective moves**: Probably the safest way to deal with Kyurem-W outside of the pink blobs is to revenge kill it or hit it first to minimize collateral damage. Though Kyurem-W's Speed tier is better than most, it still leaves it outsped and KO'd by stuff like Palkia, Mega Blaziken, all forms of Mewtwo, Genesect, Terrakion, and Mega Lucario. However, none of these can switch in safely without being KO'd or severely damaged due to Kyurem-W's power.
