[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder uses a damage-dealing Dragon-type move, then the holder consumes this item and the power of that move is increased by 50%. One-time use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Dragon Gem can be equipped to Pokemon such as Latios and Salamence, which appreciate boosts to their Dragon-type attacks, specifically Draco Meteor, Outrage, and Dragon Claw. As the Dragon Gem is only a one-time use, however, it is typically outclassed by other boosting items, such as Life Orb, Choice Band, and Expert Belt, all of which are better over the course of a match.</p>

<p>This is, however, not so much the case in VGC, where the immediate power and few drawbacks of Dragon Gem can be more useful to Pokemon such as Garchomp and Latios.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Occur randomly in Dust Clouds.</p>
