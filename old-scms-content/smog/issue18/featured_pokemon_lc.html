<h2>History</h2>

<p>Gastly is one of those Pokemon that fills a specific role on Little Cup   teams, and if a Pokemon does it better, then Gastly will be  nonexistent.  For a good amount of the DPP and BW LC metagames, that Pokemon was  Misdreavus with its higher Speed and defenses. Thankfully for Gastly, Misdreavus was banned in both  metagames, giving it the  chance to shine. And how! After the banning  of Misdreavus, Gastly  became the most popular Pokemon to use in DPP  (alongside Gligar), and in BW, it is currently behind only Mienfoo in  terms of usage. Gastly has thus managed  to separate itself  from the likes of Drifloon and Duskull in DPP and  Frillish in BW.  Because of this, Gastly has been able to firmly plant  itself as one of  the best Pokemon in Little Cup throughout both  metagames, a feat that  only Gligar was able to boast until it was banned in Round 4.</p>

<h2>Gastly's Qualities</h2> 

<p>Gastly has numerous strengths, and some of them are quite apparent. The   first is its blistering Special Attack, reaching 19 with a neutral   nature, or 20 with a boosting one. In Little Cup, these numbers are only   beaten by Abra and Solosis. In addition, it is also quite fast, being   able to hit 18 Speed. Unfortunately, it cannot hit the magic Speed tier   of 19, which is a little disappointing. Gastly's  Ghost / Poison typing  is also incredible, giving it immunities to Normal-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks in conjunction with Levitate. Sadly, its  weakness to Dark-type attacks make it easy for Pokemon like Stunky and  Pawniard to switch in and trap it with Pursuit. Its ability, Levitate, is one of  the best in the game, giving it an  immunity to Spikes to go with the mentioned Ground-type immunity. On a different note, Gastly also carries a  wide array of special attacks, ranging from strong STABs in Shadow Ball and  Sludge Bomb to coverage moves such as Thunderbolt and Energy Ball.</p>

<h2>Playing With Gastly</h2> 

<p>The best way to use Gastly is to make the most out of its enormous   Special Attack and relatively high Speed. This means that a Life Orb or   Choice Scarf set works most efficiently, with Shadow Ball and Sludge   Bomb taking the first two slots, leaving the last two for Thunderbolt,   Trick, Hypnosis, Substitute, or a Hidden Power. These sets can prove   very effective in the late-game, but both of them are very vulnerable to   trappers  such as Stunky and Pawniard unless Gastly has Substitute or  Hypnosis. Despite Gastly's low defenses, it can also run less  hyper-offensive  sets in a the form of a bulky Eviolite set. This set  contains  Hypnosis, Substitute, Shadow Ball, and Sludge Bomb with an EV  spread of  116 HP / 36 Def /116 SpA / 196 Spe and  a Timid nature. The  purpose of a bulkier set is to allow Gastly to  survive more neutral  hits, such as Chinchou's Thunderbolt, in order to set up  Hypnosis and Substitute  more reliably. A variant of this set, more  popular in the fourth  generation, was used with Hidden Power Fighting  sometimes over Sludge  Bomb, and Leftovers or Oran Berry over Eviolite.  This way, with a  successful Hypnosis, Gastly can hide behind a  Substitute relatively  easily and proceed to sweep teams.</p>

<h2>Playing Against Gastly</h2> 

<p>Gastly's biggest downfalls are its low defenses and weakness to   Dark-type attacks, and these should be exploited in order to take out   the specter. Stunky is probably the best trapper to beat Gastly, since   it resists both Ghost- and Poison-type attacks and can trap Gastly with   Pursuit. Stunky also hits 18 Speed, so it can potentially net an easy  KO  on Gastly before it even moves. Gastly's low defenses also make it   vulnerable to most neutral attacks, so most Pokemon that outspeed Gastly   and have a neutral STAB attack can usually 2HKO or sometimes OHKO   Gastly. Magnemite is immune to Sludge Bomb and resists Shadow Ball, and   can easily OHKO most variants with a Life  Orb-boosted Thunderbolt.</p>

<h2>Fitting Gastly Onto Your Team</h2> 

<p>Gastly is an offensive Pokemon in nature, and its teammates should   reflect that. Gastly doesn't need a lot of support no matter which set   it runs, but there are a few Pokemon that can, and should, take   advantage of the qualities (superior Special Attack, high Speed, four   immunities)  which Gastly brings to the table.</p>

<h3>Environmental Factors</h3> 

<p>Stealth Rock is absolutely vital to Gastly's success as a sweeper. With   opponents guaranteed to lose health every time they switch in, checks   and counters will be less inclined to switch in knowing that they'll   have to stave off a strong Shadow Ball or Sludge Bomb. Dwebble is one   of, if not the best, users of Stealth Rock there  are, and can almost  always set it up along with at least one layer of Spikes before going down.  Ferroseed has great synergy with Gastly, as it resists  Ghost-, Dark-,  and Psychic-type attacks, while Gastly in turn is immune  to the  ever-common Fighting-type attacks. Toxic Spikes is also never a  bad  thing for Gastly, but offensive teams might be hard-pressed  to find room for Trubbish or Tentacool.</p>

<h3>Teammates</h3> 

<p>A strong Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mienfoo or Croagunk goes a long  way in supporting Gastly, as most trappers  are easily handled by them. Fighting-types also fare quite well   against Lileep and Ferroseed, two thorns commonly in Gastly's side.   Speaking of Lileep, it is also a good teammate for Gastly as  it  easily handles Chinchou, a bulky Water-type that  can usually  sponge two hits from Gastly and take it out with  Thunderbolt or Hydro  Pump. Because Gastly cannot hit 19 Speed, it will  struggle against  faster Pokemon with strong STAB attacks, such as  Staryu. For this  reason, reliable Choice Scarf users in Snover and  Chinchou will be quite  effective in removing faster threats.</p>

<h2>Get Out There!</h2> 
 
<p>Gastly has once again managed to establish itself as one of the biggest   threats in the Little Cup metagame. With high Speed, a strong Special   Attack stat, and a solid offensive typing, Gastly has proven for the   second time that it is a true contender in Little Cup. If you're playing   Little Cup and need a strong Ghost-type to fill the void that   Misdreavus left, look no further than Gastly, because this Pokemon will  surely not disappoint.</p>
