Moves
========

Play Rough is a powerful, decently accurate STAB which decimates dragon, Fighting, and Dark types.
Sucker Punch is useful for picking off weakened Pokemon that might be faster (or slower in Trick room).
Iron Head is a secondary STAB that hits other fairies, rock, and ice types hard.
Protect is a very useful move in doubles, as it lets Mawile's partner attack while moves targetting Mawile will fail.

Set Details
========

A faster set with 252 HP / 164 Atk / 92 Spe with 31 Spe IVs and an Adamant nature can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as 0 Spe Tyranitar and Scrafty out side of Trick Room.
This set can be used on Trick Room teams and on faster offensive teams to check Trick Room.
Choice Specs Rotom-W's Hydro Pump, Heatran's Heat Wave, LO Garchomp's Earthquake, and-1 CB Talonflame's Flare Blitz are all survived with this spread.

Usage Tips
========
The purpose of the set is to remove Pokemon that threaten Mawile's team.
There are two ways to play Mawile, don't Mega Evolve it immediately and switch in and out to activate Intimidate, saving it until the right conditions, or save Mawile till the end so it can sweep, in which case Hyper Cutter is the better ability. The second way is more of a secondary option and is done best when Trick Room is up and all checks and counters are weakened / removed.

Team Options
========

This set works best on Trick room teams or offensive teams looking for a check to Trick room teams.
Wide Guard support is useful, because the most common ground and fire-type moves, Heat Wave and Earthquake, are spread moves.
Thunder wave and other Forms of speed control is good support for Mawile.
Bulky water types such as Gyarados and Suicune are good partners because they easily remove or force out ground and fire types, while Mawile can switch into grass type moves.

Other Options
########

Fire Fang is an option for hitting Steel-types super effectively.
Brick Break could hit Pokemon like Heatran.
Swords Dance is a good set-up move, but Mawile hits hard enough and needs all its attacks to sweep.
Ice Punch could be useful for Landorus-Therian, a common switch-in.
Substitute is useful to block status and get free turns.
Outside of these, Mawile has a small useable movepool without many other options.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Pokemon such as Landorus-Therian and Heatran can hit very hard with their STABS. Heatran can switch in on either STAB, and can take a Sucker Punch, while Landorus-Therian can switch in on Iron head or Sucker Punch.

**Attack Control**: Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate users such as Rotom-W and Landorus-Therian are good switch-ins to Mawile. Keep in mind, that burn only cancels out Huge Power, so Mawile's attack will still hit with the force of 105 base Attack.
