[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder's stats cannot be lowered. It does not prevent self-inflicted stat drops, such as the Speed drop from <a href="/bw/moves/curse">Curse</a> or the Attack and Defense drop from <a href="/bw/moves/superpower">Superpower</a>. It also does not block the effects of <a href="/bw/moves/haze">Haze</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/heart_swap">Heart Swap</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/guard_swap">Guard Swap</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/power_swap">Power Swap</a>.</p>

<p>When the wielder is first in the party, wild encounters have a lower chance of occurring.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>As only two Pokemon have it, <a href="/bw/pokemon/heatmor">Heatmor</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/torkoal">Torkoal</a>, it will naturally be limited to seeing a very small amount of use. However, it doesn't prevent self stat reduction, so does not have any effect on Shell Smash Torkoal, unfortunately.</p>
