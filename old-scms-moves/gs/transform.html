Transforms into the foe.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Transforms into the target, copying its stats (except HP), moves (at 5 PP each), type, and ability. The stats are copied exactly, so stat Exp. Points are irrelevant. DVs of the target are copied for purposes of Hidden Power, so those are not relevant either. Metal Powder's boost is lost upon Transforming.</p>
