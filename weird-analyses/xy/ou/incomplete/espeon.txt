Dual Screens

########

name: Dual Screens
move 1: Psychic / Psyshock
move 2: Hidden Power Fire / Baton Pass
move 3: Reflect
move 4: Light Screen
ability: Magic Bounce
item: Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves

========

-Psychic is your strongest STAB, also good for picking off opponents with low health
-Psyshock hurts Blissey and surprises many special wall switch ins
-Hidden Power Fire is a good surprise move for Scizor even though Hidden Power was nerfed
-Reflect is the first staple in the set. It halves damage done to Espeon making it live at least another turn to set up Light Screen before going down
-Light Screen makes it much easier for Pokemon to set up that are weak to special moves
-Baton Pass is to escape Scizor or Tyranitar’s pursuit

Set Details

========

-Light Clay is used to maximize screen time
-Dual screens lessens damage done to sweepers- prolonging their time on field
-Max Hp is run so it doesn’t die immediately while Max Speed is so it outspeeds a majority of the metagame. But you can switch Speed with Defense so it can sponge more attacks
- Don’t lead unless if you are sure that your opponent will lead off with a Skarmory / Smeargle or something, it is best kept alive so your opponent is skeptical about using status moves
-You can also run a similar set with max Hp and Defense with Morning Sun instead of Baton Pass so Espeon might be able to set up screens more than once but Cresselia is a better for that role because of its higher health and defense
-It would be a good idea to have 0 Iv’s in Attack so it minimizes Foul Play damage from Mandibuzz (With the 0 Attack IVs Espeon can avoid a 3 hit KO from Mandibuzz w/o screens be wary of Knock Off though)

Usage Tips

========

-It is best to use Reflect first so Espeon gets the much needed defense boost against most common switch-ins
-Best switches would be support Pokemon like Smeargle and Skarmory. Be careful of Brave Bird from Skarmory though

Team Options

========

-Best used if there is a Pokemon that can abuse Justified from the dark type boost. Lucario would be a good option because it resists Pursuit while threatening out Tyranitar with Close Combat giving it a chance to set up or just attack
-A frail sweeper would benefit from the screens and the absence of rocks (Volcarona, Mega-Gyarados, Thundurus-t)
-Since you have Espeon your opponent will be wary of setting rocks letting Talon and Charizard run rampant.

Baton Pass

########

name: Baton Pass
move 1: Stored Power / Psychic
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Dazzling Gleam
move 4: Morning Sun / Substitute
ability: Magic Bounce
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

nature: Bold

Moves

========

-Dazzling Gleam makes sure a dark type can't stop Espeon
-Stored Power is for staying in for long periods of time. If you want to pass the boosts to another Pokemon then staying with Psychic is safer. While if you want Espeon to be the final Pokemon in a Baton Pass team then Stored Power will deal a lot more damage than Psychic
-Baton Pass passes the boosts to another Pokemon that will take the opposing hit better than Espeon. It also escapes Pursuit from Tyranitar and Scizor.
-Substitue prevents critical hits
-Morning Sun is to recover lost HP and makes sure Espeon can live longer
-Leftovers is if so you regain lost HP if you stay in field long enough

Set Details

========

-A pure Baton Pass team works well with this as the ultra mega Pokemon of destruction (Speed Boost from Ninjask, Sp Atk boost from Celebi etc.. Baton Passing until you end up with Espeon as the finished product.)
-Defense EV’s are nice to have because it adds on extra bulk since its Sp Atk is already good enough (Especially when it gets the +4 from a Celebi)
-HP EV’s are needed so it can sponge more hits from the opposing Pokemon better
-Stored Power is recommended if you want Espeon to be the ultra mega Pokemon of destruction
-The given EV’s prevent Espeon from being one hit KOed by an Adamant scarfed Scizor’s Pursuit and U-Turn w/o boosts
(252+ Atk Technician Scizor Pursuit vs. 252 HP / 252 Def Espeon: 156-184 (46.7 - 55%) -- 14.1% chance to 2HKO after Leftovers recovery
252+ Atk Scizor U-turn vs. 252 HP / 252 Def Espeon: 270-320 (80.8 - 95.8%) -- guaranteed 2HKO after Leftovers recovery)

Tyranitar

(252+ Atk Tyranitar Pursuit vs. 252 HP / 252 Def Espeon: 158-188 (47.3 - 56.2%) -- 27.7% chance to 2HKO after Leftovers recovery
252+ Atk Tyranitar Crunch vs. 252 HP / 252 Def Espeon: 318-374 (95.2 - 111.9%) -- 68.8% chance to OHKO)

Usage Tips

========

-Best used last with this set
-Baton Pass it out if you suspect Skarmory using Whirlwind on another Pokemon so it can bounce it back
-Rain weakens Morning Sun by half (25% healed in rain) so don’t send it out during rain unless necessary
-Although Espeon can’t be phazed out by Whirlwind, Dragon Tail / Circle Throw will switch it out by force
-Don’t be greedy, a crit will bypass screens and boosts. Even though it was nerfed (1.5) it is always better not to take the risk
-Psychic does stable damage even without boosts while Stored Power rips through teams so the choice of possible power or stability is yours.

Team Options

========

-Some good Pokemon to use for a Baton Pass team:

Scizor- Iron Defense, Swords Dance, Roost
Vaporeon- Acid Armor, Iron Defense, Wish
Celebi- Nasty Plot, Calm Mind, Recover
Scrollipede / Ninjask- Speed Boost, Swords Dance
Mr. Mime- Doesn't have any boosts but is Sound Proof meaning Perish Song won't kill it
Gliscor- Swords Dance
Togekiss- Nasty Plot
Mew- Nasty Plot, Barrier, Swords Dance, Amnesia, Rock Polish, Roost

-Using this on a sun team works pretty well since Morning Sun heals 75% instead of 50%. Also Ninetales (and pretty much every other Fire type) will appreciate the lack of rocks

Offensive

########

name: Offensive
move 1: Psychic / Psyshock
move 2: Hidden Power Fire / Shadow Ball / Hidden Power Ground
move 3: Dazzling Gleam
move 4: Shadow Ball / Grass Knot
ability: Magic Bounce
item: Choice Specs / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpAtk / 252 Spd
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves

========

-Espeon makes a pretty good late game sweeper because it can't be paralyzed
-130 base Sp Attack is nothing to laugh at
-110 Spd is above average as it outspeeds all base 100s and Terrakion / Keldeo
-Psychic is the move you should spam for the most damage
-Psyshock is so you don’t get walled by Blissey / Chansey
-Hp Fire hurts Scizor but it doesn’t have any real use after that
-Shadow Ball is for Aegislash and Ghost types, its more useful because of the steel nerf letting it hit Bronzong for super effective damage
-Dazzling Gleam covers dark and dragon weaknesses making it possible to not run Hidden Power Ice
-Grass Knot hurts Ground types and it also does a decent and other heavy Pokemon. It isn’t really a good move to be locked in though
-Life Orb would be better because Espeon has just enough coverage moves to cover most Pokemon while Specs would be a little bit stronger
-Hidden Power Ground hits Heatran pretty hard but with its massive Special Defense you are better off relying on someone else to kill it, but it surprises the opponent

Set Details

========

-Makes a great late game sweeper because of its speed
-Timid is run so you outspeed Terrakion and Keldeo while Modest is for extra power
-252 Sp Attack is to make sure that you hit hard, Espeon is too frail to live most hits anyway so no HP investment is needed
-Psychic, Fairy and Ghost have perfect coverage (They don’t hit a lot of types super effectively though)

Usage Tips

========

-Making sure anything that outspeeds is out of the game because it prolongs its time on field
-Be careful of spamming Psychic if you are using specs because of dark immunity, also Gyarados’s mega evolution is part dark
-Some EV’s can be taken from Spd so priority doesn’t hurt as much

Team Options

========

-Any Fighting and Fire type Pokemon so they could eliminate dark and steel types that may be blocking Espeon’s sweep (Infernape’s great because it gets both STABs but be wary because of its frailness it can’t switch into a lot of moves.)

Other Options

########

-Scarf would we a good surprise factor but being locked into one of Espeon’s move isn’t good
-Offensive Calm Mind could work with support, but then again Espeon is your support Pokemon. It also doesn’t have the bulk to live most priority moves / physical moves
-Yawn could work but Vaporeon would be a better user because of its bulk
-Psych Up and Baton Pass is gimmicky at best. Ditto would also be better at copying stat boosts because of Imposter

Checks & Counters

########

**Tyranitar**:

-Assault Vest Tyranitar is extremely annoying, it can tank pretty much any move then KO with Crunch or Pursuit
-Scarf Tyranitar/Scizor is Espeon’s biggest nightmare. If it has a scarf then it is faster than Espeon’s Baton Pass and most times you never suspect it being a scarf. It also KO’s without HP / Defense investment

**Blissey and Sp Def tanks**:

-Goodra can wall Espeon with its massive Sp Def but Psyshock does hurt it
-Blissey can’t touch Espeon with Toxic / Thunder Wave but it can --V
-Walls Espeon unless if it carries Psyshock
-Can Soft Boil / Wish stall Life Orb variants to death

**Fast / Scarfed Psychical Attackers**:

-Because of Espeon’s pitiful Hp and Def it can’t live most STAB attacks

**Priority**:

-All (Excpept Vacuum Wave) Priority moves are physical attacks which target Espeon’s horrible defense
