Overview
########
- 150 Special Attack
- One of two Dragons not weak to Fairy
- Dual STAB unresisted by pokemon relevant in the tier
- Its movepool, whilst shallow, can be tailored to deal with specific threats
- Great wallbreaker, particularly in sunlight
- Defog means that Stealth Rock is less of an issue
- Some nice resistances in Grass, Fire and Steel (especially the last two)
- Its ability, whilst uninspiring, is solid and has several uses, such as hitting Flash Fire Heatran with Blue Flare
- Low Speed, only base 90
- Kyogre is very common as always :(
- Needs a LOT of support from its team members to be effective - it needs its checks removing, it needs hazards on its side of the field cleared, it needs sun support etc
- Reshiram finds it hard to differentiate itself from Kyurem-W, as they are both hazards weak wallbreakers with bad defensive typing but beautiful STABs, although Kyurem-W has better speed, 20 higher base Special Attack and a slightly better movepool

Flame Charge
########
Name: Charge Into the Flames!
Move 1: Blue Flare
Move 2: Draco Meteor / Dragon Pulse
Move 3: Roost / Focus Blast / Stone Edge
Move 4: Flame Charge
item: Life Orb / Flame Plate
Nature: Timid
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpAtk / 252 Spe

Moves:
========
- Blue Flare is Reshiram's main STAB move.
- With Flame Charge, Reshiram can boost its mediocre speed.
- Pulse more reliable than Meteor as Reshiram wants to stay in for several turns. However, you can run both if you really want.
- Stone Edge for stupid turkey birds, Roost for HP recovery, Focus Blast for coverage (read: Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock). Pick which one you want depending on the rest of your team.

Set Details
========
- EVs and nature optimise firepower and speed
- Naive can be used if Stone Edge is used, otherwise Timid is the best choice
- Life Orb is usually the best item, as at +1 speed, Reshiram will want to hit hard with all of its moves. Flame Plate can be used to power up main STAB move (Blue Flare) as well as Flame Charge, and also stops annoying LO recoil when using Flame Charge.
- if not using Stone Edge, Atk EVs go into a defensive stat - not HP though

Usage Tips
========
- Bringing Reshiram in on things it can threaten out/kill is the best thing to do, e.g. Reshiram can come in on Pokemon such as Scizor/Ferrothorn etc, and get a Flame Charge for free, killing them if they stay in/getting the boost if they switch. Aegislash doesn't appreciate it either :)
- Using a set of Flame Charge/Blue Flare/Dragon STAB/Roost to pile pressure on certain Arceus formes can also be a good tactic, as those without a supereffective move struggle to stop Reshiram boosting with Flame Charge - 0 SpAtk Judgment does a maxinum of 44% - meaning that Reshiram can boost and heal off damage with Roost, and eventually get round to Blue Flaring the opposing Arceus.
- Switching in on Will-O-Wisp from said Arceus formes is nice and easy too :).

Team Options
========
- Groudon support is very nice for Blue Flare. Groudon can also set up SR so that Ho-Oh can't switch into Reshiram when it wants. Pysically defensive Ho-Oh can take on opposing Ho-Oh nicely too :)
- Checking Kyogre is necessary too, as Kyogre can come in easily after one of its teammates dies, or if Reshiram is at -2 following a Blue Flare. Palkia works well as a teammate.
- Defog/Rapid Spin very nice too, as LO recoil and hazards stack up very quickly indeed. An Arceus Forme that syngernizes well with Reshiram, such as Arceus-Water or Arceus-Grass, can provide Defog support as well as checking Scarf Kyogre nicely. They can both check Palkia in different weathers (Arceus-Grass in rain, Arceus-Water in sun) Arceus Grass can also take on Earthquakes aimed at Reshiram, but does't appreciate the amplified Fire weakness.
- Fairies aren't so much an issue as they don't appreciate Blue Flare.
- Fairy types of your own to deal with faster dragons are nice, although if said Dragons aren't scarfed, Reshiram can deal with them itself - scarf Zekrom can only hope to speed tie after a Flame Charge as well.


Toxic/Roost Reshiram
########
Set Name: nobody likes you Supportceus
Move 1: Blue Flare
Move 2: Draco Meteor / Dragon Pulse
Move 3: Toxic
Move 4: Roost
Item: Leftovers
Nature: Modest
EVs: 252 SpAtk, 252 Speed, 4 SpDef

Moves
========
- Blue Flare is main STAB as always, nothing unusual here
- Draco Meteor vs Dragon Pulse is a choice to make, Draco Meteor is probably better though.
- Toxic is a very useful tool this generation, and is integral to this set's success
- Roost is to heal off damage.

Set Details:
========
- Toxic means that this Reshiram set is tailored to stall out certain support Arceus Formes such as Fairyceus. Reshiram's bulk allows it to take weak unboosted Judgments from support Arceus formes, whilst they slowly perish to Toxic Damage.
- Roost allows Reshiram to heal off any damage from said Judgments/other moves, and keeps Reshiram healthy alongside its Leftovers.
- Blue Flare and Dragon STAB mean that Reshiram still maintains an impressive offensive presence.

Team Options:
========
- Groudon is nice for Blue Flare, but as this set isn't as all out offensive as the others it isn't mandatory.
- Teammates to take on those that this Reshiram can't deal with, such as Arceus-Rock/Arceus-Ground, and Geomancy Xerneas (although Reshiram will typically be faster and deal heavy damage with Blue Flare before Xerneas can do its thing) are needed. Physically defensive Yveltal can handle SD Arceus-Ground as well as checking Extremekiller, which can set up all over this set (or murder it with EQ). Aegislash or Scizor can take Xerneas. Kyogre/Palkia/other Water-types can take Arceus-Rock. Mega-Blaziken can murder Arceus-Rock too (and sun benefits them both too). Arceus-Grass can take Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Rock on pretty well too, and can also handle Kyogre so that Reshiram doesn't drown to scarfed Water Spout.
- A Ho-Oh check is needed, as the bird can come into this set with impunity - Blue Flare and Draco Meteor do no meaningful damage, especially after Regenerator, and Toxic isn't that big an issue either, again due to Regenerator. Groudon can set up SR and boost Blue Flare. Landorus-Therian can sponge Ho-Oh's attacks and retaliate with a Rock move of choice. Zekrom can murder Ho-Oh (doesn't appreciate burn though). Physically defensive Ho-Oh works too.
- Defog and Rapid Spin is appreciated as always :)


Choice Scarf
########
Set Name: Scarfshiram
Move 1: Blue Flare
Move 2: Draco Meteor / Dragon Pulse
Move 3: Toxic
Move 4: Stone Edge
Item: Choice Scarf
Nature: Rash / Naive
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpAtk / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Blue Flare is Reshiram's main STAB, and with sun support is very powerful even with no boosting item.
- Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse allows Reshiram to revenge kill other Dragon-Types.
- Stone Edge is there to murder Ho-Oh, either revenge killing it or predicting its switch-in.
- Toxic, whilst maybe sounding stupid, can be useful to status something that is about to sweep your team: eg Toxicing a CM Arceus.
- If needed, Sleep Talk can be run in the last slot, along with Focus Blast in the third slot, so that Reshiram can serve as a check to Darkrai, murdering it with any of 3 moves :)
 
Set Details
========
- EVs maximize special atacking power and Speed, whilst not lowering the power of Reshiram's Stone Edge.
- Rash vs Naive is a choice to make, either more power or the possibility of outspeeding/tying with other base 90 scarfers.
- Dragon Pulse is weaker but more reliable than Draco Meteor - however, Palkia can survive a Dragon Pulse, especially with AV or if it is a bulky set, so Draco Meteor is probably best.
 
Usage Tips
========
- Scarf Reshiram is best used as a revenge killer, and perhaps a late game cleaner with Blue Flare.
- Again, prediction is required try and ensure that Kyogre and Ho-Oh are not given free turns to come in and fire off attacks.
- Groudon support is again needed.
- To kill a 248 HP Ho-Oh variant with Stone Edge, it needs to have taken around 12% damage for Stone Edge to be a sure OHKO.
- Careful when using moves, as Scarf Reshiram is not particularly powrful and various dangerous members of the tier can set up on each move.

Team Options
==========
- Groudon (as usual). With sun support, Reshiram becomes much more potent.
- Something to take on Kyogre is needed, as it can come into Blue Flare with impunity. Palkia is a good partner, as it can also thrive under sunlight, can carry Thunder to get rid of Kyogre, and can form a double dragon core with Reshiram, potentially overwhelming the opposing team's dragon check.
- Something to take on Ho-Oh is needed as well, as it can come in on fire moves and proceed to set up a substitute/hit your team for damage etc
- Defog or Rapid Spin support again is nice, as it allows Reshiram to switch in and out to revenge kill pokemon without taking lots of damage upon each switch-in.
- A Fairy check is also useful again (lol), as the opponent can potentially sack something to a Choice-Locked Dragon move, or just come in on one, and gain a free turn as Reshiram is forced to switch out.
- Pokemon to handle setup sweepers are absolutely essential, as many tier members can set up on resisted moves / -2 Draco Meteor etc.


Other Options
########
- Substitute + Roost with Leftovers/Life Orb can work alongside Dragon Pulse/Draco Meteor and Blue Flare, as it blocks status and protects it from revenge killers.
- Sunny day and/or Solarbeam is also gimmicky, but could - maybe - work
- Tailwind is interesting, as it doubles Reshiram's speed, but doesn't really last long enough. If you want to use Tailwind, a neutral Speed nature and 176 Speed EVs lets you outrun Scarf Terrakion.
- Choice Specs is a nice item (and a throwback to last generation), but LO tends to be powerful enough and there are too many Pokemon in the tier that can set up on a choice-locked move, and Kyurem-W does the role of Choice Specs nuke better anyway.
- An all-out attacker set isn't bad, but Kyurem-W (again) tends to do it better with higher Speed and Special Attack.
- Will-O-Wisp can be nice to catch certain tier members off guard.
- Dragon Tail can be used to scout switchins, but is weak, has negative priority and is useless otherwise (hazard damage is nice i guess).
- Focus Blast can be considered on other sets, but it's unreliable and easily taken advantage of, especially if choice locked.

Checks and Counters
########

**Blissey**: has huge special bulk and can switch in on Reshiram pretty much all the time. has to watch out for sun-boosted Blue Flare though.

**Water-Types**: SpDef Kyogre can switch in and take Reshiram's assault nicely, reducing Blue Flare's power by 66% as well. Arceus-Water can do this too.

**Ho-Oh**: Ho-Oh can pivot into Reshiram (no SR of course) and heal itself with Regenerator. Has to watch out for Stone Edge though.

**Arceus-Rock**: can take most hits from Reshiram all day, especially in sand (except Focus Blast). Doesn't appreciate Toxic though.

**Tyranitar**: Special Defense helps it take everything but Focus Blast nicely. neesd to watch out for Toxic though.

**Fairy-Types in rain**: being immune to one STAB move and protected from the other one by rain, both specially defensive Xerneas and defensive Arceus-Fairy can take hits from Reshiram when it's raining. Need to watch out for Charge/Roost or Toxic/Roost sets though, as these can wait for the rain to go away.

**Calm Mind Arceus Formes": Arceus with Calm Mind can set up in Reshiram's face, especially after a Draco Meteor drop or if Reshiram is locked into a move. Rain-dampened Blue Flare is also inviting for them. However, none like switching into boosted Draco Meteor or Blue Flare, and they hate Toxic too.

**Revenge killers**: Banded Ho-Oh can kill with EQ. Faster Dragons can kill Reshiram easily. Priority from Arceus-Normal/Yveltal can take large parts of Reshiram's health, and kill it once it is weakened. Terrakion can easily revenge with Stone Edge. Scarfed Xerneas can kill weakened Reshiram, and scarfed Kyogre can do the same.

**Stealth Rock and other hazards**: Reshiram despises Stealth Rock and all other hazards, being weak to everything.
