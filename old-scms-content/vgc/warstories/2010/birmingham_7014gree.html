<p>So I had 2 weeks to prepare this team, wanted to win but I guess I knew it wouldn't happen :P</p>

<p>This is how my day went:</p>

<p>I woke up early (at 5am) but and left home at 7 or 8am (I honestly can't remember). I got to the NEC at around 10:30 and was one of the first in the queue.</p>

<p>I saw a few people I knew were from Smogon further behind in the queue, but I couldnt be pissed going over.</p>

<p>This was my team:</p>

<p>Smeargle (Own Tempo) @ Focus Sash<br />
Jolly-31/31/31/x/31/31<br />
244 HP / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 248 Spe<br />
-Dark Void<br />
-Detect<br />
-Follow Me<br />
-Super Fang</p>

<p>248 Speed to underspeed max Speed Smeargles after Trick Room, but still outspeeds Abomasnow (my only way of stopping Mewtwo + Abomasnow leads). No Fake Out, becuase everyone predicts it and targets Smeargle. IF I WANTED FAKE OUT I'D USE INFERNAPE OR WEAVILE. Super Fang helps Dialga kill stuffs. Follow Me against Kyogre + Hitmontop leads.</p>

<p>Dialga@Lum Berry<br />
Quiet-31/x/31/31/31/0<br />
252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD<br />
-Dragon Pulse<br />
-Flamethrower<br />
-Protect<br />
-Trick Room</p>

<p>Standard Trick Room set up.</p>

<p>Abomasnow@Expert Belt<br />
Quiet-31/31/31/31/31/0<br />
252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpA<br />
-Ice Shard<br />
-Blizzard<br />
-Grass Knot<br />
-Protect</p>

<p>Trick Room sweeper. Grass Knot can OHKO Scarfogres.</p>

<p>Mewtwo@Life Orb<br />
Naive-30/31/31/31/31/31<br />
4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
-Blizzard<br />
-Thunder<br />
-Flamethrower<br />
-Selfdestruct</p>

<p>Fast sweeper once Trick Room is gone. NO ONE expects Selfdestruct on Mewtwo.</p>

<p>Koffing@Iron Ball<br />
Relaxed-LVL 1 :P<br />
-Pain Split<br />
-Curse<br />
-Spite<br />
-Grudge</p>

<p>Yes, this was to take this piss.</p>

<p>After a long journey on a few trains I arrived at the NEC.</p>

<p>I had to wait in the queue for <strong>2 hours</strong>. But I was one of the first 10 in the queue so I RNGd something while waiting :P.</p>

<h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>I come up against some guy&mdash;he be more than 14. I say good luck, then we battle.</p>

<p>He sends out Aerodactyl and sets up Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>I forget the rest.</p>

<p>2-0</p>

<h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>Next guy, he looks a bit older.</p>

<p>Out comes Zapdos + Electivire.</p>

<p>I get worried about Earthquake, then remember Electivire is crap.</p>

<p>I set up TR.</p>

<p>2-0</p>

<h3>Round 3</h3>

<p>From the moment I saw this guy and his friends, I knew he was a dick.</p>

<p>He sends out Jolteon + Togekiss.</p>

<p>Smeargle Detects, Jolteon fails to Thunder Wave it. Togekiss uses Aura Sphere on Dialga (~45%), Dialga sets up Trick Room.</p>
<p>Smeargle uses Dark Void, both fall asleep. Dialga Dragon Pulses Jolteon (~70%).</p>
<p>He starts complaining that I've violated the sleep clause. He gets the judges, they say play on :P.</p>
<p>I forget the rest from there, but I think he had a Metagross and Kyogre.</p>
<p>Mewtwo and Abomsnow clean up, 2-0.</p>

<h3>Round 4 vs. Osirus182</h3>

<p>So I had got through to the second set of battles, and was quite happy with my performance. Of course I wanted to go further :P</p>

<p>I go to the table and am facing a guy around 20ish. I say good luck, he says good luck. He sees my trainer name. He says something like "You're 7014gree?" I say yeah, he says something like he didn't want to battle me (correct me if I'm wrong).</p>

<p>I thought facing a Kyogre + Hitmontop lead was the worst possible outcome. It turns out Kyogre + Infernape is a lot worse.</p>

<p>Smeargle uses Follow Me, Infernape Fakes Out, Kyogre uses Water Spout(more than 50% to Dialga, Smeargle dies), Dialga sets up Trick Room.</p>

<p>Now this was the turning point in the match.</p>

<p>Out comes Abomasnow. I use Grass Knot on Kyogre for the OHKO, he switches Dialga in its place -__-. Dialga uses Dragon Pulse on Infernape, Focus Sash saves it. I thought Infernape would use Mach Punch, I completely forgot about Heat Wave. Dialga + Abomasnow are dead, Infernape dies from hail damage. He switches in Abomasnow, I switch in my last Pokemon, Mewtwo -__-.</p>

<p>Trick Room is still up, Mewtwo dies from Dragon Pulse + Blizzard before it can move. I lose 3-0.</p>

<p>If I'd predicted anything on the second turn, it could have been a completely different outcome, but he still won in the end; he was the more experienced player and he ended up losing in the third round and I hope he gets far in Hawaii. He beat some Belgian guy who I didn't like, so I don't hate him :P. I think he recorded the video, but I wouldn't be surprised if he deleted it :P. GG Osirus.</p>

<p>Although I only got to the top 32, it was a great experience and it was a fun day out.</p>
