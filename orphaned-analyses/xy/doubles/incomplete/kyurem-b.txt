Overview
########
Kyurem-B is a huge offensive threat. Thanks to its great offesnive stats, it can attack from both a physical and special standpoint and even has the capability to go mixed. Kyurem-B also sports some pretty good defensive stats which are supported by a decent typing which allows it to switch into a lot of resisted hits with relative ease. Teravolt is a useful ability as it lets Kyurem-B ignore abilities like Mega Venusaurs Thick Fat and Rotoms Levitate which will often catch out opponents who forget. Unfortunately, it has a pretty lackluster support movepool and so it can only really fill an all out attacking role on a team. Kyurem-Bs 95 base Speed doesn't do it many favors as it falls short of a lot of common threats in the metagame such as Latios and Terrakion.


Mixed Offense
########
name: Mixed Offense
move 1: Dragon Claw / Outrage
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Fusion Blot / Earth Power
move 4: Protect
item: Life Orb / Expert Belt
nature: Lonely
evs: 240 Atk / 44 SpA / 224 Spe

Moves
========
Dragon Claw is Kyurem-Bs main physical STAB. It has the power to OHKO every Dragon-type Pokemon in the metagame bar itself provided they do not have a Haban Berry. Outrage can be used in this slot and has the potential to be very effective thanks to the increase in power. However you cannot chose your target which is a significant drawback. In addition to this, you will be unable to use a different move once locked into Outrage. Ice Beam is a great secondary STAB which effectively handles Landorus-T as well as the odd Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur. Fusion Bolt is a powerful coverage moves that can net OHKOs on Pokemon such as Politoed and Mega Charizard Y. It also provides good damage against Pokemon that resist Ice and Dragon-type moves. Earth Power is a solid choice to hit Rotom forms as well as Heatran.

Set Details
========
The speed provided allows Kyurem-B to outspeed max speed Adamant Landorus-T which it can subsequently OHKO with Ice Beam. The investment provided gives Kyurem-B the strength to OHKO 252HP Heatran with Earth Power and provides a little bit more of a kick for any other special attacks it may be using. A Life Orb is generally the more useful item but use of an Expert Belt can bluff other items and means you won't have to deal with recoil damage. A Lonely nature is best since Kyurem-B handles special attacks better than it takes the physically-based ones as it resists types such as Electric and Water and Grass which typically have specially-based moves.

Usage Tips
========
The use of speed control in the form of moves such as Icy Wind or Thunder Wave is greatly appreciated by Kyurem-B as it means that it does not need to worry about its middling speed and can attack without reservations. Kyurem-B should be used to switch into resisted hits to put you into a situation where you can apply a lot of pressure to the opponents team and force further switches. Thanks to its great power and coverage, Kyurem-B can be used to plow through more defensively orientated teams as well as some faster, frailer teams.

Team Options
========
Choice Scarf Gardeovir Partners well with Kyurem-B as it has the ability to take down common intimidate users as well as Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Latios with Moonblast. Quick Guard support means Scizor is much less of an issue for Kyurem-B, good users include Hitmontop and Terrakion. Tailwind support from Togekiss is good since it can also use Follow Me to disrupt oncoming attacks, particularly Dragon-type attacks, aimed at Kyurem-B. Pokemon that can handle opposing Fairy-types such as Scizor are useful as Kyurem-B is often unable to do very much to them.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Dragon Claw
move 2: Fusion Bolt
move 3: Outrage
move 4: Ice Beam / Rock Slide
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 32 HP / 252 Atk / 224 Spe

Moves
========
Dragon Claw is the safer option over Outrage since it lets you pick the target and it will hit insanely hard when coming off Kyurem-Bs fully invested base 170 Attack stat. It hits hard enough to 2HKO most Intimidate users, even at -1. When it is safe to use it, Outrage has the raw power to smash through even some of the more bulky Pokemon that poulate the metagame. Fusion Bolt is a strong choice for coverage and lets Kyurem-B dent Pokemon that resist its STABs such as Heatran which it can 2HKO. There are also some Pokemon like Politoed and Mega Charizard Y that it can easily OHKO. Despite the lack of Special Attack investment, Ice Beam is really useful just for KOing with Landorus-T. If the Ice-type coverage is not needed, Rock Slide is an excellent choice for its ability to deal good spread damage.

Set Details
========
The Choice Band coupled with the EV spread and nature ensures that Kyurem-B will be hitting as hard as possible and helps it overcome the effect of Intimidate to an extent. The speed ensures that it will outspeed Adamant Landorus-T whilst the final few EVs are put into HP to provide a little bit of extra bulk.

Usage Tips
========
Kyurem-B provides a lot of offensive pressure which can be used to buy teammates free to turns to use moves such as Substitute which can quickly give you the upper hand. You shouldn't be too hasty to use Outrage as you cannot choose the target it will hit so it causes unnecessary coinflip scenarios. Outrage should only be used when you need the extra power or you can afford to hit either target. Intimidate and burns are much more threatening to this set so it is important to attempt to clear out Pokemon that carry moves like Will-O-Wisp before being too reckless. Kyurem-B needs to avoid Fairy-type Pokemon as it is difficult to take them down, especially when locked into a Dragon-type move.

Team Options
========
Togekiss can support Kyurem-B with moves such as Follow Me to redirect attacks as well as Thunder Wave and Tailwind to help alleviate Kyurem-Bs middling speed. Jirachi is similar to Togekiss except its typing means it handles oncoming Fairy-type attacks better, however, it is not immune to Draogn-type attacks. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can clear out common Intimidate users such as Hitmontop as well as frailer Dragon-types like Latios and Garchomp. Partners like Mega Charizard Y that can handle Steel-type Pokemon that Kyurem-B struggles with are beneficial as it means Kyurem faces less resistance as it attempts to punch holes. Scizor and Aegislash are powerful options as both are Pokemon that can handle the Fairy-types that threaten Kyurem-B, they also deal with Terrakion well.

Other Options
########
A full special set utilizing Draco Meteor can be effective since it does not have to worry about Intimidate or Will-O-Wisp spam. Focus Blast can be a useful option since it can OHKO Bisharp with ease. Iron Head can hurt Fairy-types like Sylveon and Gardevoir more than Fusion Bolt. With good prediction, Substitute allows Kyurem-B to put even more pressure on the opposing team and can protect it from Intimidate as well as oncoming attacks. If hail support is available Blizzard is preferred over Ice Beam. Damage reducing berries such as the Haban, Chople or Charti can be used to lure in Pokemon that expect to be able to easily take down Kyurem-B. Zen Headbutt provides super effective coverage on Fighting-type Pokemon like Hitmontop and Conkeldurr which can be useful. Roost can be used for longevity and it increase Kyurem-Bs overall bulk. A Power Herb can be used for a more powerful physical STAB in the form of Freeze Shock, however it isn't usually worth it. A Dragon Fang can be held to boost the power of Kyurems Dragon-type attacks and also bluff other items such as a Choice Band.

Checks & Counters
########
**Attack Control**: Both burns and Intimidate can have a big impact on Kyurem-B, particularly for the Choice Band set. They stops Kyurem-B from being able to hit as hard meaning it is much easier to handle. Hitmontop and Scrafty are the most irritating Pokemon for Kyurem-B to deal with since both neuter its attack and then threaten it with powerful Fighting-type moves.

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Both Fairy and Steel-types find it easy to switch into most of Kyurem-Bs attacks and bite back with powerful super effective moves. Mega Gardevoir is a big threat since it can use its Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice to destroy Kyurem-B whilst also doing damage to its partner. Scizor can easily switch in and force Kyurem-B out with the threat of its Technician-boosted, STAB Bullet Punch. Bulkier threats like Assault Vest Conkeldurr and Scrafty also threaten Kyurem-B as they can take a hit and then proceed to dish out damage with their super effective STABs.

**Speed**: Faster threats such as Latios, Garchomp and Terrakion all carry moves that can plow through Kyurem-B and so they need to be avoided. Super effective moves are not the only worry, plenty of faster threats can hit Kyurem-B for a lot of HP before it can retaliate. Examples include Mega Charizard Ys sun-boosted Heat Wave and Mega Khangaskhans Return.
