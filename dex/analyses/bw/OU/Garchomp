[Overview]

<p>Since being unbanned, Garchomp has remained unchanged. Hence, Garchomp is still a threat that teams must be prepared for, as it is capable of ripping teams apart with its two powerful STABs and high-powered moves coming off its base 130 Attack. Besides its unique dual typing, Garchomp has very well distributed stats, which is rarely seen from a sweeper of its caliber. Despite its impressive attacking prowess and natural bulk, Garchomp sits at a rather strange Speed tier, outpacing a vast number of threats but falling short of many of the pokemon that check it, specifically Keldeo and Latios. Rough Skin is no godsend ability either, but it allows Garchomp to wear down physical attackers with increased ease. Despite its common weaknesses and strange Speed tier, Garchomp is a valuable Pokemon on many types of teams, and should always be considered when building one.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to its good natural bulk and Speed, Garchomp can function as an efficient lead, able to deploy Stealth Rock quickly and then begin tearing up the opposition. Arguably the best move in the game, Stealth Rock breaks opposing Focus Sashes and Sturdy. Unlike many other Stealth Rock users, Garchomp has the advantage of being able to stand up against sun teams and beat many common spinners. Outrage, Garchomp's strongest physical STAB attack, enables Garchomp to destroy most of OU, as it is only resisted by Steel-types and tanked by only the physically bulky Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Gliscor. However, due to its predictability and drawbacks, Outrage is better left until Steel-types have been either removed or severely weakened. Earthquake is Garchomp's other STAB attack and is useful for beating opposing Fire-, Steel-, and Rock-type Pokemon such as Ninetales, Jirachi, and Terrakion. Fire Blast is used here to help Garchomp bypass the Steel-types that aren't bothered too much by Earthquake, specifically Skarmory, Scizor, and Ferrothorn, which gives Garchomp more room to pepper the opponent with continuous Outrages. However, if Steel-types aren't of too much a concern for Garchomp, Swords Dance is a perfectly usable option over Fire Blast, as it cranks up Garchomp's Attack stat, improving its ability to sweep through the opposition.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If desired, a bulky spread of 252 HP / 196 Def / 60 Spe with a Jolly nature may be used, as it allows Garchomp to stomach hits from the likes of Choice Band Scizor and Tyranitar, both of which can only 3HKO with Bullet Punch and Crunch respectively, while still being able to outspeed Adamant Lucario, maximum Speed Heatran, and 136 Speed Ninetales. Leftovers then becomes a viable item selection if you opt for this bulky spread, as it allows Garchomp some passive recovery. When using the bulky spread, Toxic is worth considering, as it cripples Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Cresselia, Gyarados, and Rotom-W, all of which Garchomp has trouble dealing with. In regards to the item you choose for Garchomp, each of them has their own specific purpose. Rocky Helmet allows Garchomp to compound residual damage against physical attackers, such as Scizor or Terrakion, dealing 29% damage to them every time they make contact with Garchomp. Focus Sash gives Garchomp insurance against Mamoswine leads or leads that carry Ice- or Dragon-type moves, guaranteeing that Garchomp is, at the very least, able to get Stealth Rock up. Do note that if a different item is chosen; such as a Lum Berry to cure a Lava Plume burn from Heatran or a Life Orb to crank up Garchomp's power and allow it to swiftly 2HKO opposing Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T; that they are to be used only if you are not using Garchomp as a lead, as it will always prefer to have a Focus Sash then. Aqua Tail is always an option over Fire Blast and Swords Dance for coverage against these bulky Ground-types, especially if Garchomp is being used on a rain team.</p>

<p>Like most other Dragon-types, Garchomp appreciates having Magnezone to trap and remove Steel-types before beginning its rampage, allowing it to freely spam Outrage with little consequence. However, because this set often runs Fire Blast, it can already bypass Skarmory and Bronzong, the only Steel-types that trouble Garchomp, making this support unnecessary. If Swords Dance is chosen over Fire Blast though, this is a mandatory teammate selection, as Garchomp will find itself hard-pressed to get past opposing Steel-types that can shrug off an Earthquake or two otherwise. Because this variant of Garchomp isn't necessarily designed to stick around the entire match, a spinblocker in the form of Jellicent or Gengar is appreciated, as they maintain Stealth Rock, by preventing Rapid Spin users from removing it. Jellicent in particular makes for an excellent partner for Garchomp, as it resists Ice-type attacks thrown towards Garchomp, while Garchomp is immune to the Electric-type attacks aimed at Jellicent.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Garchomp's three key resistances give it multiple opportunities to come in and set up a Swords Dance before wrecking the opposing team. After a Swords Dance boost, Garchomp becomes the definition of a terrifying sweeper, as its Attack stat hits a sky-high 718, enough to 2HKO the entirety of OU. After a second boost (god forbid), everything in the tier is OHKOed (factoring in Stealth Rock damage). Outrage obliterates anything that isn't a Steel-type after a Swords Dance boost and allows Garchomp to easily bypass bulkier Pokemon, such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T. However, Dragon Claw may be used instead if the locking of Outrage is unfavorable to you. Be warned though, Garchomp will miss out on many OHKOs. STAB Earthquake crushes many of the Steel-types, namely Jirachi, Heatran, and Metagross, that resist Outrage. It's also handy for devastating opposing Rock-types, such as Terrakion and Tyranitar, without having to be locked into Outrage. Aqua Tail provides Garchomp with excellent neutral coverage, being able to destroy Landorus-T and Gliscor after a Swords Dance boost. Due to the popularity of rain teams, Garchomp doesn't necessarily need to find itself on one to get the added boost to Aqua Tail. Fire Fang is an option over Aqua Tail to hit troublesome Steel-types such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Scizor harder, but Aqua Tail still does more damage to these three with rain support, which they are typically found on.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of item comes down to preference, as a Life Orb allows Garchomp to hit stupidly hard, even OHKOing 200 HP / 244 Def Landorus-T at +1 after Stealth Rock, OHKOing 252 HP / 252+ Def Hippowdon after prior damage with a +2 Outrage, and even 248 / 244+ Gliscor after Stealth Rock. However, a Yache Berry will allow Garchomp to survive an Ice Shard from opposing Mamoswine or an Ice Beam from offensive Starmie and attack back before being knocked out. A Haban Berry is another valid consideration for Garchomp's item, reducing the damage caused by Dragon-type attacks from opposing Dragonite or Latias. However, more powerful attacks, specifically Draco Meteor and Outrage from Choice Specs Latios and Choice Band Dragonite, respectively, will still OHKO Garchomp, limiting its overall use. Fire Blast also deserves a mention over Aqua Tail and Fire Fang, as it matches Fire Fang's damage output and targets the weaker Special Defense stat that many Steel-types are plagued with. If choosing Fire Blast, a Naive nature should be used to keep Fire Blast as strong as possible. A combination of Substitute, Swords Dance, and a Salac Berry might be used, as it allows Garchomp to safely set up against opposing switch-ins for one turn and potentially giving it the opportunity to tie with opposing Choice Scarf Garchomp while having the freedom to switch moves. While Swords Dance Garchomp doesn't need much team support, there still are problem Pokemon for it, specifically Mamoswine and the majority of the Pokemon that outspeed it. Skarmory can be problematic too, as it is only 2HKOed by a +2 Fire Fang. Because of these threats, partners such as Magnezone, Scizor, and Starmie are great choices; Magnezone traps and KOs Skarmory; Scizor is able to bypass everything faster than Garchomp, bar Infernape, thanks to Bullet Punch and U-turn; and Starmie handles the loose ends and Infernape.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Garchomp becomes one of the most effective revenge killers in the tier thanks to its excellent Speed and Attack. Outrage is Garchomp's strongest physical attack, effectively destroying many weakened opponents, and serves as its main STAB attack. However, it's a move best not to just spam off the get-go, and better reserved for once Steel-types are either severely weakened or removed. Earthquake crushes many of the Steel-types that resist Outrage, namely Jirachi, Magnezone, and Heatran. Unlike Outrage, Earthquake is a more spammable STAB move, as Garchomp doesn't need to fear being locked into attacking when an Ice Shard user or opposing Steel-type is still lurking about. Fire Blast gives Garchomp the ability to smelt through common Steel-type switch-ins such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress, and opens up room for Outrage to wreak havoc. Alternatively, Stone Edge can be used to nail opposing Thundurus-T, Volcarona, and Gyarados, but has less accuracy and utility than Fire Blast. Dual Chop provides Garchomp with an alternate Dragon-type STAB attack to chose from, thus not having to lock itself into Outrage. Dual Chop carries the added benefit of hitting twice, potentially breaking opposing Substitutes and Focus Sashes and allowing Garchomp to deal extra damage. Alternatively, Dragon Claw may be used over Dual Chop as it deals the same amount of damage, just all at once, and has 100% accuracy.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Aqua Tail may be used over Stone Edge or Fire Blast if Garchomp is being used on a rain team as it deals commendable damage to neutral targets and opposing Hippowdon. However, Aqua Tail has very little utility outside of rain, as many targets that would be hit super effectively by it are also hit super effectively by Earthquake. Sleep Talk can also be used in the fourth moveslot, as it allows Garchomp to easily and safely switch into Breloom's or Amoonguss's Spore and still be able to attack. Because Choice Scarf Garchomp is not exceptionally powerful, entry hazards in the forms of Stealth Rock and Spikes are greatly appreciated. Common lead Pokemon such as Custap Skarmory or Forretress are capable of supplying both hazards and are usually capable of laying more than one layer of Spikes. Strong teammates capable of weakening a team enough for Garchomp to finish off or vice versa are also appreciated. Other Dragon-types, such as Dragonite, Latios, or Kyurem-B make for effective partners for Choice Scarf Garchomp, as their superior attacking stats are able to capitalize on the holes punched by Garchomp or provide holes for Garchomp to exploit. Even though Garchomp has access to both Earthquake and Fire Blast, its inability to switch moves still finds Garchomp wanting team support in removing opposing Steel-types. This makes Magnezone and Dugtrio excellent teammate considerations, as Magnezone is capable of trapping and KOing most Steel-types, while Dugtrio traps and eliminates grounded Steel-types, specifically Heatran and Jirachi. Despite having a base 102 Speed stat, Garchomp is still outsped and threatened by many popular Choice Scarf users in the tier, such as Keldeo and Latios, and appreciates having either bulkier teammates, such as Celebi and Latias, to sponge their attacks or powerful priority users, such as Lucario, Scizor, and Breloom, to bypass their increased Speed stats and remove them.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Once given a Choice Band, Garchomp becomes a very potent wallbreaker as its Outrages and Earthquakes deal terrifying damage to whatever doesn't resist them. Garchomp's higher base Speed stat sets it apart from other Dragon-type Choice Band users, as it outspeeds the majority of OU. Outrage is Garchomp's Dragon-type STAB and decimates anything that isn't a Steel-type or a dedicated physical wall. Earthquake is also STAB, and it allows Garchomp to crush most Steel-types that fearlessly switch in expecting an Outrage. Earthquake is also handy for sinking opposing Fire- and Rock-types, such as Infernape and Tyranitar, further making switching into Choice Band Garchomp even harder. Fire Fang completes Garchomp's coverage, nailing the likes of Skarmory, Scizor, Forretress, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. However, Aqua Tail does quite a number to common Garchomp switch-ins, such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Donphan, potentially opening up room for Garchomp or a teammate to begin a sweep. Alongside the popularity of rain teams, or if Garchomp is used with rain support, Aqua Tail's damage output is increased, also allowing Garchomp to deal severe damage to most of Fire Fang's targets. Dual Chop is used to give Garchomp a Dragon-type STAB without locking itself into Outrage. Dual Chop holds a lot of utility, being able to bypass opposing Focus Sash users and break Sustitutes, and is also capable of OHKOing Substitute Breloom, but requires an Adamant nature to do so. Dragon Claw offers the same base power as Dual Chop, but at a perfect accuracy and all at once. However, be warned, as both attacks are significantly weaker than Outrage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stone Edge is a viable option over Dragon Claw or Dual Chop, as it increases Garchomp's super effective coverage, nuking opposing Volcarona, Gyarados, and Thundurus-T. However, that's all it has to offer, and it has shaky accuracy. Because Steel-types will really hinder the use of Outrage, and Fire Fang only manages to 3HKO. Skarmory, Magnezone, Dugtrio, and Magneton make for excellent partners for Garchomp, as they can trap and eliminate opposing Steel-types and give Garchomp more room to blast off those powerful Outrages. Priority users such as Scizor and Mamoswine make for excellent teammates for Garchomp, as they can pick off many of the Pokemon that threaten Garchomp by outspeeding it. Scizor also has the added utility of carrying U-turn, bringing Garchomp in for free. Mamoswine also has Stealth Rock, which makes Garchomp's life easier by weakening the opponent. Steel-type teammates such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Jirachi are also appreciated, as they can sponge Garchomp's weakness to Dragon- and Ice-type attacks, while Garchomp easily stomachs the Fire-type attacks aimed at Ferrothorn and Jirachi.</p>
[Other Options]

<p>A Classic ChainChomp set utilizing Draco Meteor and Fire Blast is still viable, as it destroys most of Garchomp's common checks, namely Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Ferrothorn, but is significantly weaker than physical variants that rely on Outrage and Fire Fang, as Garchomp lacks any way outside of Choice Specs and Life Orb to boost its Special Attack. A bulky set utilizing an EV spread of 252 HP / 196 Def / 60 Spe that capitalizes on the concept of passive damage via Stealth Rock, Toxic, Protect, and Dragon Tail has potential on a sand team, as it will slowly wear the opponent out. However, Steel-types completely shut this set down, and would require removal in order for this set to be successful. Garchomp has weaker utility moves, namely Dragon Tail and Bulldoze, which could be used in order to either phaze opponents or slow non-Levitating Choice Scarf users and give Garchomp room to beat them down. Outside of those however, Garchomp's offensive movepool is outclassed by either STAB Outrage or Earthquake, leaving very little to no merit for moves such as Crunch or Iron Head.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Garchomp itself is very hard to switch into due to its raw power, and beating it usually requires coming on the revenge kill. However, Skarmory and Bronzong easily sponge Garchomp's STAB moves and are only 2HKOed by Garchomp's Fire-type attacks. In Skarmory's case, it is capable of phazing Garchomp, whereas Bronzong may carry Hidden Power Ice to directly threaten Garchomp. Other Dragon-types, specifically Latios and Latias, are huge threats to Garchomp, as they outspeed Garchomp and can target its weaker Special Defense stat via Dragon Pulse or Draco Meteor. If Garchomp lacks a Choice Scarf, +1 Dragonite and Choice Scarf Salamence and Kyurem-B then become huge issues for Garchomp, as they all outspeed it and slam Garchomp hard with opposing Outrages. Beefier Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, Gliscor, and Landorus-T are all capable of tanking an Outrage or two, and have semi-powerful attacks or status to get back at Garchomp. Both Gliscor and Landorus-T have the added advantage of having an Earthquake immunity. However, both Forretress and Ferrothorn must watch out for any Fire-type coverage that Garchomp may have, whereas Gliscor and Landorus-T must watch out for boosted Outrages and Aqua Tails, as each incident ends up as an OHKO after Stealth Rock. Powerful Ice-type Pokemon, namely Mamoswine, Cloyster, and the odd Weavile, also present huge issues for non-Yache Berry Garchomp, as its compound weakness to Ice-types prevents it from tanking even weaker hits. Mamoswine and Cloyster's access to Icicle Spear allows them to bypass the effects of Yache Berry and proceed to OHKO Garchomp. In the case of Weavile, Ice Punch does so much damage that a Yache Berry won't help Garchomp in the slightest. Priority users can tend to be a thorn in Garchomp's side as well, as its uninvested defenses may be high, but they aren't enough to take powerful neutral hits.</p>
