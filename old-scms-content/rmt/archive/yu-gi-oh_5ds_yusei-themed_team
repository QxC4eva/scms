<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Back when the Shoddy Uber Ladder first came up, I managed to get to 6th place using a full-on Baton Pass team that lead with Magic Coat Smeargle.</p>

<p>After that, I just gave up any hope of reaching 1st place and stopped playing Pokemon for a while.</p>

<p>Then I read Train Man's Warstory he posted about a week ago: http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=47115.</p>

<p>I had met Train Man during my first endeavor on the Uber tier, and his warstory really inspired me to get back into Uber Laddering. First day, I obtained 8th place ranking. On my second day, I obtained the 2nd place ranking. And finally, on the third day, I obtained the coveted (in my mind) 1st place ranking. God I was so proud of myself that day, and I've been steady in that position for about a week now.</p>

<p>So, without any further adieu, Here's my team:</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/389.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Deoxys-S</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Extremespeed</p>

<p>Standard Lead Deoxys. It sometimes pisses me off when I lose the speed tie to other lead Deoxys-E, but I can usually salvage it with Rayquaza, possibly even outsmart, taking the time to Swords Dance while it tries to set up Spikes, because lead Deoxys-E usually don't carry Ice Beam.</p>

<p><strong>Bronzong</strong> @ Light Clay<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 60 Def / 196 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Hypnosis<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Reflect<br />
- Light Screen</p>

<p>Standard Dual Screen Bronzong. After setting up Spikes, I attempt to disable one of my opponent's Pokemon with Hypnosis before setting up Dual Screens and Exploding. Not many variations to this. Sometimes, when I don't want to risk missing, I just go for the Light Screen right away.</p>

<p><strong>Mewtwo</strong> @ Light Clay<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Selfdestruct<br />
- Reflect<br />
- Light Screen<br />
- Taunt</p>

<p>Backup Dual Screener. Used for when Bronzong can't really safely get the screens up, like say against Dialga, which I'm suspicious if it has Flamethrower, or another Mewtwo. The Extra Speed also often helps, as well as the ability to Taunt.</p>

<p><strong>Mew</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Synchronize<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 190 SpD / 68 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Rock Polish<br />
- Baton Pass<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Swords Dance</p>

<p>Mew is extremely hard to kill with Dual Screens up and carrying a Lum Berry. Usually I'm able to get at least one Rock Polish and one Swords Dance up before having to pass. 68 Speed outspeeds +Speed Nature, 252 Speed Deoxys-E after a +2 Boost. The Nature and whether to put some EVs into defense could probably use some work, though.</p>

<p><strong>Groudon</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Drought<br />
EVs: 108 HP / 252 Atk / 150 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Fire Punch<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>After receiving just 1 Swords Dance and 1 Rock Polish from Mew and Stealth Rock + Spikes, Groudon pretty much OHKOs everything in the Uber Tier except Giratina, which it 2HKOs with Dragon Claw. However, the Lum Berry also prevents Giratina's Will o Wisp from bothering it too much, though I'm still screwed if Giratina carries Roar and I can't OHKO it. And it wont be bothered by Priority moves too much with its amazing Defense and the fact it'll still have a couple turns of Reflect most likely. Once again, Speed EVs to outspeed Deoxys-E.</p>

<p>Rock Slide vs. Stone Edge was kind of an issue for me, but after doing calculations, I found that Groudon killed a 75% Lugia with Rock Slide only like 1% of the time using the "Great Wall" set found on this site, so I decided an 80% chance with Stone edge was still worth it.</p>

<p><strong>Rayquaza</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Air Lock<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Extremespeed<br />
- Flamethrower</p>

<p>Rayquaza is more of a backup than anything. It's also the only safe switch I have against Water Spout Kyogre leads, since Rayquaza resists Water Spout and Air Lock negates the Rain boost. It can also set up fairly safely behind Dual Screens, so the fact that I have 2 Dual Screeners really helps.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This team does have some problems with smart Trick users, and guys like ScarfRai (who also gets Trick). The Speed EVs weren't designed to outspeed anything over Deoxys-E, so obviously, I run into problems. People who use Roar Giratina effectively (something that usually isn't done unless they know beforehand that I'm using Groudon AND that my Groudon can't OHKO it with just a +2 boost), as well as putting Roar on Pokemon that don't normally carry it such as Groudon and Kyogre, also sometimes give me problems.</p>
