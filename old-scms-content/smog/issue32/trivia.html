<p>Well, I must say, Level 51 and Cereza have kept the lab awfully tidy. Perhaps I might consider keeping them on as regulars. Oh, sorry, I'm sure you were all wondering where I was. Our lovable tyrant Birkal arranged for my untimely execution in an attempt to overthrow The Smog's hierarchy and take control. I'm sad to say it worked. Alack, I've returned, and soon, will undo the corruption this fiend has caused our homely little Trivia article.

In any case, I see my stand-ins have been very competent. Don't worry, I'll make sure you guys see them again soon. Less work for me, after all...

Answers? I got 'em, just like always.</p>

<ol>

</ol>
  
<p>So now that you've all digested the intelligence that Level 51 and Cereza were able to dish out, I thought we'd do something a bit more exciting for my return. Also, congratulations to AOPSUser for winning with a remarkable 8/10 score.</p>

<p>What else but a scavenger hunt? Genius, no? The idea is simple; I'll give you a clue, and somewhere scattered on Smogon's various articles and pages are further questions and clues. The answers will be pages on Smogon, so you shouldn't get lost. I've even enlisted the help from those who were still part of the "Zystral Resistance," a.k.a. "La ReZyStance"; sandshrewz and skylight.</p>

<p>And most importantly, everyone that gets the right answer and sends them in will get the prize. Let's get the <em>dice</em> rolling. Find a Smog article.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>~Zystral, sandshrewz, and skylight</p>
