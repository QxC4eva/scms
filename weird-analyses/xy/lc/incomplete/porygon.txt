Overview
########

    Ability Capsule makes Tri Attack with Download legal.
    Great coverage + 19 Special Attack + Download makes Porygon a powerful threat that is also bulky at the same time
    Good catch-all answer to many Little Cup Pokemon, such as Gligar, Murkrow, and Carvanha. It can do this because of its astounding physical and special bulk and weakness to only 1 type.
    Fighting-types are a bit less common this gen with Fairy-types and Gligar being introduced, and they make for good partners with Porygon
    Reliable recovery in Recover. However, because Porygon does not have any resistances besides a Ghost immunity, it needs to maintain its health by using Recover a lot, which opens way for a free switch-in to a Fighting-type.
    Patches up a lot of annoying holes in one teamslot.
    Makes for a good sweeper with Agility backed by good bulk to set it up, great coverage, and a nice 19 Special Attack.


Bulky Attacker
########
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Tri Attack
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Shadow Ball / Hidden Power Fighting
move 4: Recover
ability: Download
item: Eviolite
evs: 236 HP / 36 Def / 236 SpA
nature: Modest

Moves
========

    Tri Attack is STAB and hits pretty hard when backed by a Download boost
    Ice Beam hits Archen, Gligar, Vullaby, and many other common Little Cup Pokemon.
    Shadow Ball hits Misdreavus, Bronzor, and Honedge
    Hidden Power Fighting usually OHKO's Eviolite Pawniard before a Download boost, and always OHKO's Pawniard when it is using Berry Juice or when Porygon is at +1. Hidden Power Fighting also hits Ferroseed and Magnemite harder than Porygon's other moves.
    Recover keeps Porygon healthy
    Download is used to give Porygon more power

Set Details
========

    236 EVs in SpA and a Modest nature to maximize Special Attack, rest goes in HP and Defense to keep Porygon.
    Eviolite gives Porygon more bulk which goes well with Recover
    If you use Hidden Power Fighting, the EVs you use should be 236 HP / 240 SpA. Note that you lose 2 points in Defense (factoring in Eviolite) by doing this.
    An alternate EV spread of 236 HP / 196 Def / 76 SpD and a calm nature is viable if you want to give Poygon more bulk.


Usage Tips
========

    Try to acquire Special Attack Download boosts whenever possible, as they massively increase Porygon's power.
    Tri Attack should be the move used most often, as it hits many Pokemon hard and the few Pokemon that resist it are generally destroyed by the other moves.
    Not much prediction is needed, as most of the Pokemon that switch into Tri Attack will lose the next turn to its coverage moves.
    Remember, Porygon, unlike some other bulky attackers, has a way to consistently heal its health back up. Make sure to keep Porygon healthy, as it may not be able to heal itself back up when it really needs to because of its terrible Speed.


Team Options
========

    Gligar also beats Fighting-types and checks Pawniard, while providing Porygon Defog, Stealth Rock, U-turn, or Knock Off support.
    Larvesta synergizes really well with this set because it beats Fighting-types, checks Pawniard, and can help Porygon get the Special Attack boost from Download via U-turn
    Misdreavus is a nice offensive partner as they can easily weaken each others checks, and Misdreavus also beats Fighting-types and Munchlax depending on its set.
    Timburr can switch into and break through Steel-types, Munchlax, and can break through Misdreavus/Frillish if Porygon is not using Shadow Ball


Wall
########
name: Wall
move 1: Recover
move 2: Tri Attack
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Thunder Wave / Shadow Ball
ability: Trace
item: Eviolite
evs: 236 HP / 196 Def / 76 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

    Recover keeps Porygon healthy so it can consistently beat threats
    Tri Attack is a decently strong STAB move
    Ice Beam hits a lot of important Pokemon super effectively, such as Gligar, Murkrow, and Vullaby
    Porygon makes for a good paralysis spreader with Thunder Wave, and allows Porygon to cripple non Substitute Calm Mind Swirlix. Note that using Thunder Wave prevents Porygon from beating Taunt + Nasty Plot Misdreavus, Swords Dance Honedge, and a few other Pokemon.
    Shadow Ball hits Misdreavus, and a few other assorted Pokemon like Meditite on the switch as well as Abra and Honedge.
    Trace has cool situational usage, notably for Regenerator Slowpoke, Volt Absorb Chinchou, and Flash Fire Ponyta.
    Charge Beam can be used to raise Special Attack and do a little bit of damage at the same time.


Set Details
========

    EVs and a Calm nature give Porygon a very bulky 26 HP / 16 Defense / 16 Special Defense before Eviolite
    Eviolite is the best item because Porygon has reliable recovery and wants the extra bulk.

Usage Tips
========

    Porygon can be switched into most offensive Pokemon that are not Fighting-types or Pawniard, but make sure it has near full HP before doing so.
    It is not recommended to switch Porygon into defensive Pokemon unless they are weak to one of Porygon's moves as Porygon is not that strong and is vulnerable to status.
    Maintain Porygon's health with Recover as much as possible so it can counter big threats like Swords Dance Gligar later on in the match.

Team Options
========

    Porygon wants teammates that beat either Fighting-types or Pawniard. Cleric support is also a bonus.
    Gligar counters Fighting-types and checks Pawniard, while Porygon beats Water- and Ice-types as well as Archen for Gligar.
    Slowpoke counters Fighting-types while Porygon patches up most of Slowpoke's Special Defense weaknesses, but this combination is weak to Pawniard.
    Spritzee and Snubbull beat most Fighting-types handily and have Heal Bell. Note that Porygon can not provide much support to Spritzee and Snubbull back, and that this combination is vulnerable to Pawniard.
    Fighting-types like Timburr and Mienfoo can beat Pawniard, Munchhlax, and Steel-types

Agility
########
name: Agility
move 1: Agility
move 2: Tri Attack
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Hidden Power Fighting / Shadow Ball
ability: Download
item: Berry Juice
evs: 36 Def / 240 SpA / 200 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

    Agility boosts Porygon's Speed so it can sweep
    Tri Attack is STAB
    Ice Beam hits a lot of common Pokemon in LC hard, most notably Archen, and is decent coverage in general.
    Hidden Power Fighting hits Pawniard and Magnemite
    Shadow Ball hits Steel- and Ghost-types besides Pawniard, but otherwise isn't really needed.


Set Details
========

    EVs maximize Porygon's Special Attack and Speed
    Modest nature is used because Porygon is already fast enough after an Agility
    Berry Juice is used so Porygon has an easier time setting up + extra bulk is always great.


Usage Tips
========

    Try to set up Agility vs Pokemon you get the Special Attack Download boost from, like Gligar.
    This set up condition is pretty specific, but Porygon does not always need a Download boost to sweep, as long as the opposition is properly weakened (Steel-types, Munchlax, and certain very specially bulky Pokemon) and Porygon can get an Agility boost, it should be fine.
    Note Porygon can still avoid the OHKO from most non Fighting-type attacks even without Eviolite or defensive investment.


Team Options
========

    A slow U-turn/Volt Switch/Baton Pass Pokemon such as Larvesta or Chinchou is very useful for assisting Porygon in set up; while Porygon is not frail, it has very specific sweeping conditions in that it could really use a Special Attack boost from Download for sweeping.
    Swords Dance Gligar beats most of the Pokemon Porygon cannot
    Misdreavus wears down a lot of Porygon's checks
    Pawniard can bait physical walls as well as Knock Off Eviolite's for Porygon to sweep
    Timburr



Other Options
########

    Thunderbolt and Discharge are decent moves but don't provide much notable coverage
    Choice Scarf (3 attacks + Trick) revenges Chlorophyll Pokemon but otherwise isn't that great because it does not get to take advantage of Porygon's awesome coverage, Recover, or Agility
    Trick Room can be used instead of Agility, but the short duration of Trick Room may cut Porygon's sweep short.
    Psychic hits Fighting-types a lot harder than Porygon's other moves, but is otherwise redundant coverage.
    Recycle + Berry Juice can be used on the bulky attacker or wall set. Berry Juice gives Porygon 7 more HP than Recover, and gives Porygon a one-time passive heal, but Porygon usually prefers the additional bulk granted by Eviolite, and Recover healing is usually sufficient enough.
    Life Orb with Agility can be used for extra power, but it makes Porygon die too fast and makes it lose any defensive utility it would otherwise have.


Checks & Counters
########

    Fighting-types are the best Pokemon for breaking through Porygon, but they will take a lot of damage if they switch directly into a boosted Tri Attack. Meditite is the best Fighting-type for switching in, as it can live a Tri Attack with some HP to spare, outspeed Porygon, and then Drain Punch Porygon to regain most of its HP back. Fake Out + Bullet Punch Meditites can get some decent chip damage against Agility Porygon. Timburr is another good candidate as it is also pretty bulky, and has Mach Punch to stop an Agility Porygon's sweep.
    Pawniard does not take much from anything besides Hidden Power Fighting, and massively cripples Porygon with Knock Off.
    Munchlax doesn't directly beat Porygon, but can easily switch in and withstand its assaults. From there, Munchlax can Body Slam Porygon until paralysis, or Whirlwind/Toxic Porygon, and then switches into a Fighting-type when it forces Porygon to Recover.
    Berry Juice Magnemite undergoes a similar procedure as Munchlax; it wears down Porygon until Porygon is forced to Recover, and then switches into a Fighting-type while Porygon uses Recover.
    Lickitung can wall even Download Porygon and Dragon Tail it out, or pass a Wish to a Fighting-type so the Fighting-type can beat Porygon.
    Ferroseed does not care about most of Porygon's attacks and can set up hazards and Leech Seed on Porygon.
    Toxic/WoW in general will really wear Porygon down
    Bronzor either sets up or uses Toxic on Porygon sets that lack Shadow Ball
    Frillish also counters sets that lack Shadow Ball
    Forfeiting the match and then using Porygon yourself
