<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Restores the HP of the holder by 10 HP when at 50% HP or less. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Poison-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Oran Berry is used by many defensive Pokemon in Little Cup, as for some LC Pokemon, 10 HP can be as much as half of their health. Oran Berry can also be used on offensive Pokemon to ensure that they stay alive for as long as possible. However, Oran Berry has to compete with the Eviolite item, which boosts the user's Defense and Special Defense stat by 50%. It all comes down at a choice between recovery and durability.</p>
