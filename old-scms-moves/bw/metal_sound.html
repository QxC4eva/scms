[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Special Defense by two stages. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Metal Sound is a somewhat useful move for special sweepers. Zapdos, for example, can use Metal Sound to catch unfavorable switch-ins off guard, and possibly threaten with a stronger Thunderbolt. However, the accuracy and the fact that the target can switch out to reset the drops makes this move overall unfavorable.</p>
