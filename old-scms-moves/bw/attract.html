[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Infatuates the target, making it unable to attack 50% of the time. Fails if both the user and the target are the same gender, if either is genderless, or if the target is already infatuated. The effect ends when either the user or the target is no longer active. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute. Pokemon with the ability Oblivious are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Attract can be an infuriating move, and infatuation is an infuriating status condition, but it rarely sees competitive use thanks to its inconsistencies. Any Pokemon with Attract is easily dealt with by a genderless Pokemon or a Pokemon of the same gender. Basing a team or set on Attract is risky; the number of Pokemon you'll be able to infatuate varies heavily from match to match, which could result in your Pokemon having a wasted moveslot. Even if you successfully Attract your target, a simple switch on either side's part will rid your foe of their infatuation. On Pokemon Showdown! and other such simulators, however, the move can be of greater use, since the default gender will always be male, and so setting your Pokemon's gender to female will almost always result in a successful use of Attract. Some even choose to run Attract alongside other status moves such as paralysis or confusion, in order to further lessen the chances of the foe doing anything. However, be warned that genderless Pokemon still ruin this strategy, as do Pokemon with Substitute or Taunt, and the best competitive battlers will always set their Pokemon to female to deal with this kind of tactic.</p>
