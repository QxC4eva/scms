Blocks the effects of weather.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All effects of fog, hail, rain, sandstorm, and sun are temporarily disabled as long as the wielder is in play. The weather condition will continue to prevail until it fades or is replaced, but the battle will act as if there is no weather condition in play. However, the game will report the messages about what weather is active. The weather-related formes of <a href="/bw/pokemon/cherrim">Cherrim</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/castform">Castform</a> will revert to normal when the wielder is on the field. When a Pokemon with Air Lock enters battle, an activation notification of "[Pokemon] has Air Lock!" will be given.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2> 
<p>Only one Pokemon has access to Air Lock, and that's <a href="/bw/pokemon/rayquaza">Rayquaza</a>. In Ubers, Rayquaza can stymie to an extent all the Pokemon reliant on weather. Ubers is the tier where the most fearsome auto-weather inducers roam, namely <a href="/bw/pokemon/kyogre">Kyogre</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/groudon">Groudon</a>. While Rayquaza is on the field, <a href="/bw/abilities/chlorophyll">Chlorophyll</a> and <a href="/bw/abilities/swift_swim">Swift Swim</a> users no longer get their Speed boost, <a href="/bw/moves/thunder">Thunder</a> users such as Kyogre lose their perfect accuracy, and some of the sting is taken off boosted Water- and Fire-type attacks in rain and sun, respectively. Unfortunately, this also means that Rayquaza can't make use of the boosts to moves such as <a href="/bw/moves/waterfall">Waterfall</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/surf">Surf</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/fire_blast">Fire Blast</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/v-create">V-create</a> that it would ordinarily get from the weatherâ€”but hey, you win some, you lose some.</p>
