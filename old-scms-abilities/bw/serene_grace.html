<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder's secondary effect chances of its moves are doubled (including those with 100% effect chances), with the exception of <a href="/bw/moves/secret_power">Secret Power</a>. Moves that receive a flinch chance from <a href="/bw/items/kings_rock">King's Rock</a> or <a href="/bw/items/razor_fang">Razor Fang</a> will receive a 20% flinch chance, up from the usual 10% chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Serene Grace is a very, very useful ability. First of all, it allows users of flinching moves, such as <a href="/bw/moves/iron_head">Iron Head</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/rock_slide">Rock Slide</a>, to flinch their opponents often (Iron Head has a 60% chance of causing a flinch with Serene Grace), making them good checks to slower threats that doesn't resist those moves, pairing up very well with paralyzing moves such as <a href="/bw/moves/thunder_wave">Thunder Wave</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/body_slam">Body Slam</a>. Furthermore, it allows such Pokemon to make use of <a href="/bw/moves/thunder">Thunder</a> and Body Slam as reliable paralyzing moves while still damaging the opponent, making the use of <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a> in order to block status more difficult, and unable to be stopped by <a href="/bw/moves/taunt">Taunt</a>. It also allows them to paralyze Ground-types with Body Slam, a feat which would be impossible with Thunder Wave. Such Pokemon include <a href="/bw/pokemon/jirachi">Jirachi</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/togekiss">Togekiss</a> in OU, while <a href="/bw/pokemon/shaymin-s">Shaymin-S</a> enjoys an 80% chance to lower the foe's Special Defense with <a href="/bw/moves/seed_flare">Seed Flare</a>, as well as also having access to <a href="/bw/moves/air_slash">Air Slash</a>. All in all, Serene Grace is an awesome defensive and offensive ability that makes good use of moves that already have an high chance of causing their secondary effects.</p>
