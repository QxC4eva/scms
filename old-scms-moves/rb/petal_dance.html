<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Locks the user into this move for 2-3 turns. Confuses the user at the end.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While Petal Dance may seem like a competitively viable move due to its power, it is usually not recommended to use due to its poor coverage. Grass-type attacks are resisted by a fairly large amount of common threats, and you probably don't want to be locked into a move like this.</p>
