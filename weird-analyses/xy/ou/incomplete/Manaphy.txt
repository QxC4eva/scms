Overview
########

    Access to one of the best boosting moves in the game
    Awesome base 100 stats across the board has good synergy with Tail Glow
    A movepool decent enough to do what it needs to do
    CroCune 2.0
    Rain nerf made it tolerable

Tail Glow
########
name: Tail Glow
move 1: Tail Glow
move 2: Surf
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Energy Ball / Psychic
ability: Hydration
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SDef / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Tail Glow is the ultimate special setup move, boosting Manaphy's special attack by 3 stages
    Surf is the STAB option of choice, being both accurate and powerful
    Ice Beam is good for hitting Grass and Dragon types that resist Surf
    Energy Ball for Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and other bulky Waters
    Scald can be used over Surf but it misses a few KOs
    Psychic can be used over Energy Ball to hit Rotom-W for 2HKO and also OHKO Mega Venusaur

Set Details
========

    The choice between Leftovers and LO comes down to whether survivability or power is more important
    Wacan Berry to lure Thundurus
    a bulkier spread can be used of 90 HP / 252 SAtk / 4 SDef / 162 Spd with a Modest nature can be sued to outspeed Adamant Excadrill
    If using Stciky Web, use 4 Def EVs so Genesect can't Espeed with +atk

Usage Tips
========

    Best used as either a wallbreaker/lure (for Rotom-W) early game, or a late-game cleaner
    Works extremely well with Sticky Web support due to its main counters being faster Pokemon
    Make sure to take out Pokemon like Thundurus before sweeping
    Powerful wallbreakers work really well with it, Special Mega Lucario, Mega Garchomp, and other mixed or strong attackers can break down special walls for it

Team Options
========

    Sticky Web support is huge so Galvantula works well as a partner, also outspeeds and does huge damage to faster threats to Manaphy like Garchomp, Terrakion, Mega Pinsir, etc.
    Something to deal with Blissey such as LO Latios with Psyshock works well (also helps with Thundurus)
    Strong Fighting types such as Terrakion, Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Infernape
    Rain support is welcome but not necessary
    Magnezone for Ferrothorn
    Mamo can help wear down Ferro and deal with Thundurus
    Non-MB Excadrill love Manaphy's ability to lure in and OHKO Rotom-W

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Rest
move 3: Rain Dance
move 4: Scald
ability: Hydration
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 236 Def / 20 Spe

Moves
========

    Calm Mind boosts SDef and SAtk easily thanks to Manaphy's great bulk
    Rest in combination with Hydration can heal Manaphy completely when running low on health
    Rain Dance to set up its own rain if necessary
    Scald is STAB option, and can wear down opponents with burn

Set Details
========

    Enough Speed for neutral nature base 70s, rest put in bulk
    Leftovers is highly recommended in terms of items to increase survivability, but LO can be used if on a dedicated rain team
    With Life Orb, +6 Manaphy can 2HKO even Chansey with Surf
    if power+survivability is desired, Mystic Water can be used instead

Usage Tips
========

    This set makes an excellent cleaner, but is bulkier than the first set
    Works well against defensive teams more than offensive
    Setting up against walls is advisable

Team Options
========

    Politoed is a great partner for providing rain
    Pokemon to deal with Thundurus such as Latias or Mamo on the predict can work well too
    Mega Venusaur forms really great core with this
    Heatran also works well with Manaphy to cover weaknesses, but not if using Politoed

Other Options
########

    Rain setter for rain teams with U-turn for momentum
    Tail Glow+Rest set for rain teams
    Scarf set, but is mainly outclassed by other Scarfers (Rotom-W) due to a general lack of power when unboosted
    Heart Swap is an interesting move to take advantage of setup sweepers, but it's rather gimmicky and hard to pull off
