Heals 50% of the user's max HP.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals the user by 1/2 of its maximum HP, rounded half up. It has an in-game effect which allows you to heal the other members of your party. The user loses 20% of its maximum HP, and the target party member gains that much HP. It fails if the user is below 20% HP or the target is at full health.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Milk Drink is one of the best moves in the game, and it, or one of its equivalents (Recover, Heal Order, Roost, and Slack Off), is almost mandatory for any successful defensive Pokemon. Milk Drink is Miltank's signature move and almost solely what makes Miltank even somewhat usable. HP recovery is a crucial gameplay element, and having instant recovery to tank threats in the metagame, such as Moltres in RU, is a godsend to many teams. It's such an important move that even offensive sets of Miltank are recommended to use Milk Drink so that it can both dish out damage and tank hits for the team.</p>
