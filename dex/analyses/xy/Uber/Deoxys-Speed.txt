Overview
########

- Still a really good hazards lead since it outspeeds everything
- Defog makes it easier for teams to deal with hazards but Taunt can prevent that unlike Rapid Spin
- Knock Off recieved a significant power buff and the side effect adds to Deoxys's utility
- Just sets up hazards and dies so you are pretty much going into the game with only 5 mons. Totally worth it though if you can keep the hazards up long enough and abuse them properly.


Hazards Lead
########
name: Hazards Lead
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Knock Off / Magic Coat
move 4: Stealth Rock / Magic Coat
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

- Spikes is an excellent hazard and Deoxys-S is one of the few Pokemon that can set it up easilly
- Taunt stops the enemy from setting up on Deoxys-S or Defogging away its hazards
- Knock Off hits fairly hard and removes the target's item. This helps with Geomancy Xerneas amongst other things as well as opposing leads like Smeargle
- Stealth Rock is another important hazard and Deoxys-S sometimes find the chance to setup both hazards. There are many viable users of this move, though.
- Magic Bounce helps Deoxys-S beat Prankster Taunt users as well as add mindgames when leading off agaisnt other Deoxys-S. (although it's best to avoid that scenario if you can) It can be used over Stealth Rock if you have another teammate to use the move or over Knock Off.

Set Details
========

- Max Attack allows Deoxys-S to 2HKO Smeargle when factoring in the power drop once Smeargle no longer holds an item
- Max Speed allows Deoxys-S to outrun as much as possible and setup as many layers of hazards as possible
- If you aren't using Knock Off the attack evs can be moved to HP
- Focus Sash almost always makes sure that Deoxys-S gets to survive past the first turn

Usage Tips
========

- Lead with it and setup hazards, you rarely do much else
- Try to use team preview so that you don't have a bad lead matchup. If your opponent has a Mega Kangaskhan, odds are he/she is going to lead with it.
- Using Knock Off on a Choice Scarf holder, for example, can sometimes pay off more than an additional layer latter on in the game. Don't forget that Deoxys-S can do more than just lay down Spikes this gen even if that's still mostly the ony thing it does.

Team Options
========

- Fast Taunt users that can outspeed Arceus formes will help in keeping the hazards set by Deoxys-S up.
- Powerful setup sweepers can also disuade the opponent from Defogging and giving your Pokemon an additional turn of setup
- Shadow Tag Pokemon can also be used to trap Defoggers and eliminate them but they will require prediction and/or you still having Deoxys-S around to replace the hazards the Arceus forme will be able to Defog away before falling.
- Otherwise, just have a powerful offensive core to take advantage of the hazards Deoxys-S sets up

Other Options
########

- Toxic cripples arceus formes for the rest of the game
- Fire Punch destroys Scizor, Genesect, and Forretress
- Light Screen and Reflect can help a sweeper setup but generally setting up hazards is a better use of Deoxys-S
- Ice Beam can beat Rayquaza that try to anti-lead
- Extreme Speed can beat Deoxys-A that try to anti-lead as well

Checks & Counters
########

**Magic Coat**: Bounces back hazards and Taunt. Users need to not be vulnerable to Knock Off, however.

**Prankster Taunt**: If Deoxys-S doesn't have Magic Coat, prankster Taunt from the likes of Whimsicott or Thundurus will shut it down.

**Prority**: Strong priority or one used after a U-Turn or a poweful attack like V-Create can limit Deoxys-S to only one layer.

**Multi Hit Attacks**: Strong, muliple hit attacks can break past Focus Sash in a single turn and limit Deoxys-S to a single layer. Cloyster and Mega Kangaskhan are the most common examples. 

**Rapid Spin**: Most Deoxys-S can't do much to a Rapid Spinner like Forretress or Excadrill who can easily Rapid Spin away any hazards and quickly KO Deoxys-S with Gyro Ball and Earthquake respectively.

**Residual Damage**: Residual damage from weather like Tyranitar's Sand Storm can finish off a Deoxy-S in the same turn that a strong attack like Crunch of Payback would knock it down to its Focus Sash.

**Defog**: Although Deoxys-S has Taunt, a Defog user can force Deoxys-S into mind games where it forces it to Taunt while the Defog user attacks. Defog can also be used after Deoxys-S has fallen to clear hazards.
