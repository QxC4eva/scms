After the pre-battle tintinnabulation is complete, please stare in awe and wondrous presentiment at what is conceivably the best Pokemon in the entire game. Dare not incur Arceus's divine wrath, or else the consequences shall be severe and merciless, and life shall become but an evanescent wisp.

Moves
=========
Swords Dance and Extreme Speed sweeps late game when His checks have been weakened or removed. Shadow Claw is a weak but reliable method for Arceus to damage Ghosts. On the other hand, Shadow Force is powerful yet easy to play around. Earthquake is Arceus's strongest attack against Rock- and Steel-types. Magic Coat is a very interesting option to bounce back status thrown at Arceus, as well as reflecting Roar and Whirlwind. It also allows Arceus to serve as a decent anti-lead that prevents Deoxys-S, Smeargle, and others from setting up their entry hazards. Overheat allows Arceus to fry Scizor, Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory, although it must be used carefully if rain is present. Brick Break can replace Earthquake to hit Ferrothorn in the rain, but is a rather weak option to hit all the other Steel-types with. Recover can be used to boost up more slowly, but since most of Arceus's counters either use status or does enough damage to offset Recover, it is a rather poor option most of the time, especially when it costs Arceus a precious coverage move. Substitute can prevent status, but since a lot of walls have Roar or Whirlwind, it can only get Arceus so far.

Set Details
=========

This is probably Arceus's most iconic set. With His excellent bulk and decent power, He can easily set up late game when His counters have been weakened and mop up the remains. Extreme Speed and bulk makes it very difficult to revenge kill. He is rather difficult for an offensive team to take Arceus down late game. What makes Arceus scary to offensive teams is that those Pokemon that can kill Arceus tend to be ripped to shreds by Extreme Speed, while those that can take Extreme Speed tend to either be too slow, in which case they are destroyed by coverage moves, or they are too weak to take down Arceus. This is not to say that Arceus is invincible (far from it), but He does force the opponent to pack either a relatively hard counter or a loose group of checks to make sure that Arceus does not sweep them. Arceus's role is not just limited to that of a sweeper, either. His strong priority allow it to take down a lot of frail or weakened threats, for example, Blaziken. If He is packing Magic Coat, He can also serve as a very good anti-lead, bouncing back entry hazards or just picking off the opponent with Extreme Speed.

Usage Tips
=========

Please don't be single-track-minded and just send Arceus in at the earliest opportunity to set up and attack. That kind of mentality would just waste you a perfectly good Arceus. It is very important to realise Arceus is a late game cleaner, not a wall breaker. Should your opponent still have a Giratina, Lugia, or any other physically bulky wall, you're just going to end up getting Arceus crippled. It also means that while Arceus is bulky, you also have to know the limits of what He can take, and potentially how much damage He needs to sweep. Setting Arceus up on a Kyogre that is in the middle of spamming Water Spout is just going to result in a dead Arceus. It also means that if your opponent potentially still has a Pokemon that can tank an Extreme Speed and chip Arceus, that even tanking Surf from Kyogre might be a bad idea. When Arceus looks so scary on paper, people often tend to give into hubris and make a mockery of themselves. They fail to recognize that while Arceus looks amazing on paper, He has some serious limitations in practice. Most notably, Extreme Speed, for all its priority, is actually not that strong. Anything remotely physically bulky can take one and stop Arceus from sweeping. A Pokemon like physically defensive Ho-Oh can tank a +2 Extreme Speed and hit back hard with Sacred Fire, potentially crippling Arceus in the process. That being said, if you are smart with using Arceus and expecting to sweep with it only when you've lured out and crippled its checks, there really is no other Pokemon that can get the job done like Extreme Killer Arceus.

Arceus has a number of EV spreads that He can run. The one provided above allows Arceus to speed tie other Support Arceuses. An Adamant nature can be run with 124 Spe to outspeed positive natured base 90s, most notably Timid Dialga. A slower EV spread of 16 Spe can be used to outspeed Modest Dialga, or 56 to outspeed Swords Dance Rayquaza.

As for the item, Arceus generally has three options. Lum Berry allows Arceus to avoid status from Will-O-Wisp wielding support Arceus. It is very important to note that Arceus is very weak with a Lum Berry, so you really need to weaken the opposing team before you try to sweep. Life Orb is preferred if are you using a Jolly nature to offset the drop in power. It is also better on sets using Overheat to give it the extra kick needed to take down Skarmory. Silk Scarf is a good option to boost the power of Extreme Speed without the recoil, and is a decent option on variants using Magic Coat. Leftovers can also be used, but is rather useless, since the most common ways of dealing with Arceus are status and phazing, while Leftovers does not help Arceus avoid any 2HKOes.

Team Options
=========

Mega Gengar traps and either weakens or eliminates most of Extreme Killer's checks and counters, including Lugia, Groudon, support Arceus, and Skarmory. If could also sacrifice itself to take down Arceus's counters with Destiny Bond. Swords Dance Lum Berry Groudon, Knock Off Blaziken, and Calm Mind Kyogre with Ice Beam can severely weaken or outright KO Giratina formes that are not trapped by Mega Gengar. Xerneas pairs well with Arceus, resisting Fighting-type moves aimed at Him, as well as brutally ripping Giratina formes a new one with Moonblast. Ho-Oh can switch into Will-O-Wisps and phazing moves aimed at Arceus and dish out powerful Brave Birds and Sacred Fires, provided you can give it Defog or Rapid Spin support. Yveltal and Darkrai can take advantage of Giratina and Lugia's inability to do anything to them, either being able to fire off really strong attacks or putting things to sleep. Mewtwo can switch into Fighting-type moves.

If Arceus is using a Lum Berry, it is very much recommended that He is supported by multiple layers of entry hazards, namely Spikes, it He is quite weak without an item to boost His power. Regardless of the item, Sticky Web is always helpful for Arceus, allowing Him to slow down revenge killers such as Terrakion and Mega Gengar. Unfortunately for Arceus, there are not many good Sticky Web users. Smeargle is probably the best Sticky Web user. Shuckle can also set up Sticky Web relatively reliably.

Other Options
=========
- Calm Mind, but it's overall pointless when other Arceus formes do it so much better.
- Grass Knot can be used for Groudon and Hippowdon.
- Choice Specs, but Choice Band does Choice Tricking better in general.

Checks & Counters
=========
- Extreme Killer may look incredibly intimidating, but one thing you really need to keep in mind is that it can't run everything at once.
- In general, unboosted Arceus is weak (Life Orb is a bit stronger, but that comes with cost), which means it'll need to set up before it does anything remotely intimidating - never let it set up for free: hit it really hard with your powerful move, or get Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, or Leech Seed onto it.
- Even when boosted, it tends to not hit bulky Pokemon TOO hard. If it catches you on something like Scarf Thunder from Kyogre, go to your defensive wall and Dragon Tail or Roar it out, limit the amount of times that Extreme Killer can come in and set up.
- That being said, Arceus has no technical safe switch-in - it has also has a away to beat a specific counter if it wants to.

In general though:

- **Defensive Yveltal**: Can tank a +2 Extreme Speed with good health after Stealth Rock and OHKO in return with Foul Play. Does not like Will-O-Wisp or Trick, though.

- **Unaware Quagsire and Clefable**: Have a lot of problems in and of themselves, and are potentially beaten by Magic Coat (as well as Trick), but they don't care about Swords Dance and tanks Extreme Sped with no problem at all. Quagsire is a bit better since it can also use Scald to fish for burns which can't be stopped by Magic Coat.

- **Sableye and Mega Banette**: Can burn Arceus in a jiffy and use Magic Coat to severely damage those that attempt to boost more after getting burnt (as well as play mind games with Magic Coat). Sableye does not enjoy Trick, though, and Mega Banette is much more susceptible to Will-O-Wisp.

- **Status**: Probably the only really reliable thing that every Arceus hates. Trouble is the Lum and Mirror Coat can potentially screw you over, but getting Will-O-Wisp on attacking variants and Toxic onto Wallceus (and offensive variants too), although Arceus being not very strong means that even if you status onto a Lum variant, you'd normally be able to try again and then find a way to stall it out. Status also includes Leech Seed, anything that saps Arceus's health will put Him on a timer and make Him much easier to stall out.

- **Phazing**: Good thing Arceus is relatively weak compared to other hard hitters. This makes Him a bit easier to phaze out. Be careful that you may get bounced back by Magic Coat, so it is good to use something bulky and hits hard to make Him second guess whether to Magic Coat or not. Something like Groudon is a lot harder to play around with Magic Coat, because getting hit by Earthquake isn't something that Arceus wants to do over and over again, and Groudon can take a couple of Extreme Speeds. Dragon Tail bypasses Magic Coat completely, although it has fallen out of favour in the metagame due to Xerneas's presence.

- **Bulky Steel-types**: Skarmory is still the best, even though it needs to watch out for Overheat or Magic Coat. Forretress can use Toxic and stall with Pain Split. Both of them need to watch out for Trick from Choice Band Arceus and Will-O-Wisp. Scizor and Mega Scizor can tank an attack from Extreme Killer Arceus and OHKO in return with Superpower, but needs to watch out for Will-O-Wisp from Wallceus. Ferrothorn can annoy Arceus that lacks Brick Break or Overheat with Leech Seed and Toxic. Mega Aggron can tank a hit or two from Extreme Killer and phaze it out with Roar or Dragon Tail.

- **Physical walls**: Includes Giratina, Hippowdon, Xerneas, and Lugia. All three can take an attack from Extreme Killer and status or phaze Him. Note that Magic Coat makes status and phazing unreliable at times. Hippowdon and Lugia also lack any way of crippling Arceus's power, so you need to either phaze Arceus or use status, and phazing becomes useless when Arceus is a last Pokemon. Xerneas can Roar Arceus out, and can hit relatively hard.

- **Support Arceus formes resisting Extreme Speed**: These can be iffy since Jolly Arceus speed ties with them and Will-O-Wisp can miss, so luck is not on your side. It is made worse with Lum Berry being relatively common. However, against slower Arceus or those without Lum Berry, they are very good, since Will-O-Wisp will cripple them easily. Any support Arceus that lacks weakness to Arceus's coverage moves can also burn Arceus in an emergency, although all of the above need to watch out for Magic Coat and Lum Berry. Fighting Arceus is a bit different, as it can tank an Extreme Speed and deal heavy damage back with Judgment.

- **Physical tanks**: Includes Choice Band Landorus-T, Groudon, physically defensive Ho-oh, Giratina-O, physically defensive Gyarados with Dragon Tail. Landorus-T can tank a hit from Extreme Killer and OHKO with Superpower. Groudon can either hit back very hard or use Roar or Dragon Tail to force Arceus out which taking a Extreme Speed easily. Ho-oh lots of Defense investment and Stealth Rock off the field, but it can take an Extreme Speed (2 from Lum Berry Arceus) and hit back hard with Sacred Fire to fish for burns, as well as using Whirlwind to phaze Arceus out if needed, as well as using Regenerator to heal itself. It also has an advantage of being unaffected by Will-O-Wisp or Trick if you're using bulky Choice Band Ho-oh. Giratina-O can check Arceus once with Dragon Tail or burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Gyarados can Intimidate Arceus once and Dragon Tail it out, but that's about the limits of its abilities.

- **Revenge killers**: Make sure Arceus has some prior damage before attempting one (ie on the turn it sets up), since it is very difficult to actually OHKO a full health Arceus. Omastar in the rain is about the only thing that can OHKO a full health Arceus, but with weather being timed, it is not very reliable. Choice Scarf Terrakion is probably the next best one. Mega Gengar that has transformed can deal heavy damage with Focus Blast. Choice Scarf Dialga can revenge kill an Arceus at about 50% with Draco Meteor. Mega Aerodactyl can also revenge kill a weakened Arceus. That being said, a lot of Arceus formes do tend to invest in bulky over Speed, so a Terrakion with Life Orb or Choice Band will always be able OHKO those, as can Mega Lucario.
