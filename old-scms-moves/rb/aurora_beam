<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Has a 10% chance to lower target's Attack one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Aurora Beam's measly 10% chance to lower the opponent's Attack hardly justifies the drop in power from Ice Beam. Aurora Beam should never be seriously considered for a moveslot on a competitive Pokemon. Do not use this move.</p>
