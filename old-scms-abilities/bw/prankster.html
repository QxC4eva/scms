[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the priority of non-attacking moves by 1. However, moves still circumvent <a href="/bw/moves/quick_guard">Quick Guard</a>. If a move such as <a href="/bw/moves/assist">Assist</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/metronome">Metronome</a> calls a two-turn attack such as <a href="/bw/moves/fly">Fly</a>, the second turn of the move does not fall under the effect of Prankster.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The ability is a powerful one on any Pokemon, although most notable on support and SubSeed <a href="/bw/pokemon/whimsicott">Whimsicott</a>. <a href="/bw/pokemon/thundurus">Thundurus</a> can launch rapid <a href="/bw/moves/nasty_plot">Nasty Plot</a>s before being <a href="/bw/moves/taunt">Taunt</a>ed, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/sableye">Sableye</a>'s previously negative ability is essentially reversed. It is very difficult to find a situation where this ability is not preferred, as it can give so many advantages for the team, depending on what move is accelerated.</p>
