<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Wood Hammer, though limited to only a few Pokemon, is a useful move for Abomasnow, Torterra, and Sudowoodo. Wood Hammer stands as the strongest physical Grass-type attack and acts as a reliable STAB move for both Abomasnow and Torterra. It is notable on Abomasnow for being able to OHKO Tyranitar. If recoil is not of a concern, Wood Hammer is a fine choice for a STAB attack for the aforementioned two Pokemon.</p>
