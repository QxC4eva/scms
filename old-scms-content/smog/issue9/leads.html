<p>In a battle, your chances of winning will be higher if you don't often find yourself uncertain as to what move you should make. Ideally, a battler should have to press the "panic button" as few times as possible. This means that it is especially important that you do not press this panic button the very first turn of a battle. You should be able to make a smart move which immediately gives you the advantage. It might seem like common knowledge, but it is not uncommon to find a player on ladder sacrificing his lead to a bad match up, which should never happen. If you have a lead that loses to another common lead, it is important to keep that in mind when team building. So let's take a look at a few of my favorite leads, Pokémon that have good synergy with them, and how they fare against the common leads in the metagame.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><h2>Starmie and Metagross</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/121.png" alt="" /><br />
Starmie @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Rapid Spin</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/376.png" alt="" /><br />
Metagross @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 240 Atk / 16 Spe<br />
Adamant (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Meteor Mash / Explosion<br />
- Stealth Rock</p></div>

<p>Both Pokémon make excellent leads, but by leading with Starmie, it is easier to prevent Forretress and Skarmory leads, which are becoming more popular, from setting up entry hazards.</p>

<table>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/487.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Starmie can Hydro Pump Azelf down to its Focus Sash and then hope that it wins the Speed tie to finish Azelf off with Rapid Spin and get rid of Stealth Rock at the same time. If Azelf is a dual screener, Starmie needs to hope that it wins the Speed tie and Hydro Pump before Azelf Light Screens.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/142.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>A smart Aerodactyl user will Rock Slide first turn, hoping to get the flinch and allowing the 2HKO on Starmie before Starmie can spin away Stealth Rock. For this reason, it is best to switch to Metagross immediately. Metagross resists Rock Slide and can then Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch, while Starmie can Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock later. If Aerodactyl Stealth Rocks on the switch, it will usually Taunt Metagross to prevent Stealth Rock from being put up, allowing Metagross to KO with Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch anyway. Metagross is also able to survive Aerodactyl's Earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/260.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Starmie matches up well with Swampert, 2HKOing Swampert with Hydro Pump, meaning that Swampert has to choose between doing damage to Starmie or using Stealth Rock, which can be spun away later.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/376.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Starmie handles Metagross the same way it handles Swampert: by forcing it to choose between doing damage and getting up Stealth Rock before being KOed. It is worth noting that not even a Earthquake + Bullet Punch + two turns of Life Orb damage will beat Starmie, allowing it to come back in and spin later.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/385.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Fearing a Choice Scarfed U-turn, I find it best to switch immediately to Metagross, who has the bulk to take just about any attack from Jirachi. Meanwhile, you can Earthquake Jirachi for major damage or get Stealth Rock up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/395.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Starmie matches up much better with Infernape than Metagross, being able to Hydro Pump Infernape down to its Focus Sash and then Rapid Spin away the Stealth Rock.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/68.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Machamp will use Payback, so it is best to switch straight to Metagross, as Payback and DynamicPunch will not beat Metagross. Metagross can take a DynamicPunch while its Lum Berry cures it of its confusion, allowing Meteor Mash to 2HKO Machamp, which thanks to No Guard, will never miss.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/410.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Lead Roserade usually Leaf Storm a lead Starmie, so it is best to switch to Metagross, who resists the Grass-type attacks. Metagross can then beat Roserade with Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch, while Lum Berry renders Sleep Powder useless.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/248.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>This is one time you will wish you led with Metagross instead. A risky match-up, since if Starmie switches out while Tyranitar Pursuits, Starmie is dead for nothing. I find that Starmie is usually too important to sacrifice for a little damage and that lead Tyranitar with Pursuit are rare enough, so I often switch out to Metagross, which beats Tyranitar quite nicely with a super effective Meteor Mash.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/477.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Starmie is a very deadly opposing lead for Gliscor, as it can hit all switch-ins hard if the Gliscor user mispredicts. I find it best to Hydro Pump first, as that does the most damage in case a Tyranitar or Scizor is switched in. Another lead that Starmie fares better against than Metagross.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/490.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Starmie frightens Heatran, as it can OHKO Heatran with Hydro Pump. Again, Starmie fares better against Heatran than Metagross does.</td></tr>

<div style="text-align: center;"><h2>Machamp and Heatran</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/68.png" alt="" /><br />
Machamp @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: No Guard<br />
EVs: 240 HP / 248 Atk / 16 SpD / 4 Spe<br />
Adamant (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- DynamicPunch<br />
- Ice Punch / Stone Edge<br />
- Payback<br />
- Bullet Punch</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/490.png" alt="" /><br />
Heatran @ Shuca Berry<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive (+Spe, -SpD)<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Stealth Rock</p></div>

<p>Machamp has risen dramatically as a lead, rising from #13 in March to #7 in April, as people start to realize how well it does against most common leads. Once again, both make excellent leads, but Machamp fares much better against more leads.</p>

<table>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/487.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Machamp can beat Azelf by using Payback + Bullet Punch. If Azelf chooses to attack, Machamp can always survive a Timid unboosted Psychic while preventing Azelf from getting Stealth Rock up. If Azelf is Dual Screen, Machamp has some more difficulty.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/142.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Machamp can beat Aerodactyl with DynamicPunch + Bullet Punch. Unfortunately, Aerodactyl's Pressure ability can drain DynamicPunch's PP faster, so using Ice Punch, if you have it, can spare yourself some PP.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/260.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Machamp matches up much better with Swampert than Heatrean, being able to 3HKO it with DynamicPunch, and even preventing Stealth Rock if you're lucky with confusion damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/376.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Metagross will usually Meteor Mash for the 2HKO while not caring about confusion, due to Lum Berry. It is best to switch to Heatran to take the Meteor Mash. If Metagross has a Lum Berry it is at Heatran's mercy, and Heatran can either attack or get up Stealth Rock.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/385.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Jirachi has the advantage over Machamp, being able to flinch it to death with Iron Head or OHKO it with either Zen Headbutt or Psychic. Heatran does not mind coming in on any of these attacks, as it resists just about any attack that Jirachi can throw at it. Once Heatran is in, it can get up Stealth Rock or Fire Blast for the OHKO if Jirachi is foolish enough to stay in.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/395.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>One of the times you will be glad that you didn't lead with Heatran, as Infernape can threaten Heatran with Close Combat. Machamp can take any of Infernape's attacks and beat it with DynamicPunch + Bullet Punch. If Infernape chooses to Stealth Rock, Machamp will take minimal damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/68.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Machamp versus Machamp match ups always depend on whoever runs more Speed on Machamp, allowing them to 2HKO first, with confusion not playing a role due to Lum Berry.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/410.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Machamp handles Roserade well, being able to beat it with Payback, Stone Edge, or Ice Punch followed up by Bullet Punch. The best Roserade can do is get up a layer of Toxic Spikes or do some damage with Leaf Storm. Machamp matches up against Roserade much better than Heatran does.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/248.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Another lead match up where Machamp has a much better advantage than Heatran does. Machamp completely dominates Tyranitar with DynamicPunch, so much so that it might be a good idea to Payback first turn, expecting a Rotom-A switch in.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/477.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>If Machamp has Ice Punch, it can surprise Gliscor by doing a good amount of damage. This is extra helpful if your team's sweeper is a Lucario, which needs Gliscor weakened before it can sweep. If lacking Ice Punch, the best Machamp can do is DynamicPunch and confuse it before switching out. Heatran does not match up too well with Gliscor either, so it might be a good idea to pair this combination with a bulky water.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/490.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Heatran has to choose between Exploding for the OHKO or getting up Stealth Rock and dying. I usually just stay in and DynamicPunch. Opposing Heatran is still a more favorable match-up for Machamp than a 50/50 coin toss with your own Heatran.</td></tr>

<div style="text-align: center;"><h2>Roserade and Heatran</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/410.png" alt="" /><br />
Roserade @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Sludge Bomb<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Leaf Storm<br />
- Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/490.png" alt="" /><br />
Heatran @ Shuca Berry<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive (+Spe, -SpD)<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Stealth Rock</p></div>

<p>One of my favorite combinations, as fast surprise Sleep Powder ruins the opponent's opening strategy, can prevent early Stealth Rock, and disable a Pokémon. After sleeping a Pokémon, a blind switch to Heatran usually yields a good match up, as common switch-ins to Roserade tend to be weak to Heatran, since opponents are more likely to switch a Steel-type than a Water-type into Roserade. This can allow Heatran to easily set up Stealth Rock.</p>

<table>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/487.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Choice Scarf Roserade has the benefit of stopping both the dual screens and the suicide Stealth Rock versions from setting up with a fast Sleep Powder.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/142.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Choice Scarf Roserade also catches Aerodactyl by surprise with a fast Sleep Powder, which prevents Stealth Rock from being put up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/260.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Swampert will likely switch out of lead Roserade, so it is a good idea to try to Sleep Powder whatever switches in.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/376.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Due to Lum Berry being a common item on Metagross, seen 16.8% of the time, it is very risky to try to Sleep Powder Metagross. I find it best to switch to Heatran immediately. Best case scenario, Metagross tries to Meteor Mash and it does very little damage to Heatran, putting you at an advantage. Worst case scenario, Metagross uses Earthquake and uses up your Shuca Berry. Fortunately, if Metagross stays in on an expected Sleep Powder, it likely has Lum Berry and not Occa Berry, putting Heatran at an advantage, which can be used to get up Stealth Rock.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/385.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>It is likely that Jirachi is carrying a Choice Scarf, as 39.1% do, allowing Jirachi to outspeed Roserade. It is very risky to stay in, so the best option is to switch to Heatran, who is a very safe switch in to Jirachi.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/395.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Lead Infernape will usually Fake Out first, expecting to render Roserade's Focus Sash useless. However, the joke is on Infernape, as Roserade will outspeed the next turn to Sleep Powder.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/68.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>This lead can give both Roserade and Heatran troubles. Most lead Machamp carry Lum Berry, allowing it to beat Roserade. Switching to Heatran on a Payback, Ice Punch, or Stone Edge can allow you to Explode on Machamp; however, it means you will not get Stealth Rock up. It is a good idea to make sure that you have another Pokémon on your team that can handle Machamp.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/410.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Opposing Roserade expecting a Speed tie are in for a surprise, as you can just Sleep Powder them. Afterwards, you can Sleep Powder again if you expect them to switch and take advantage of Roserade's Natural Cure ability, or just go straight to Heatran for a favorable match-up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/248.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Another tough match up for this combination. Lead Tyranitar often carry Lum Berry, so it might be a better option to just Leaf Storm for some good damage. Heatran cannot do anything to Tyranitar either. This is another Pokémon that you need to have a good teammate outside of this combination to beat.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/477.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Sleep Powder or Hidden Power Ice work here, as Gliscor expects to outspeed you taunt Taunt your Sleep Powder, Earthquake to break your assumed Focus Sash, or Stealth Rock.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftsprite"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/490.png" alt="" /></td>
<td>Choice Scarf Roserade handles this just like Focus Sash Roserade: by using Sleep Powder and hoping that Heatran does not have a Lum Berry.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The most important lesson you should take away from this is to plan and think ahead. If you're able to cover a majority of lead match-ups with two Pokémon like I have illustrated, you should rarely ever be in a bad situation to start out the game. Of course, it takes six Pokémon to make a team, so you still have plenty of options to create a strategy and more synergy. These were just some of the lead synergies that I was able to think of; I'm sure there are lots more out there, so go explore and start discovering some of your own!</p>
