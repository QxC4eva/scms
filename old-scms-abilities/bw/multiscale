[SHORT DESC]
Reduces damage by 50% if the wielder is at full health.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While the wielder is at 100% HP, all damage from attacks is halved. Only the first attack of a multi-hit move is affected by this ability.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/dragonite">Dragonite</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/lugia">Lugia</a> are renowned for being bulky and difficult to kill outside of a super effective attack as it is, and Multiscale only boosts this further, making them virtually impossible to OHKO outside of STAB <a href="/bw/moves/blizzard">Blizzard</a> from something like <a href="/bw/pokemon/glaceon">Glaceon</a>. Combined with <a href="/bw/moves/roost">Roost</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/recover">Recover</a>, which can easily bring them back to full health while the opponent tries to attack with a low PP move such as <a href="/bw/moves/stone_edge">Stone Edge</a>, Lugia and Dragonite become insane walls who are also more than capable of hitting back.</p>
