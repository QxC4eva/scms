Changes user's type based on terrain.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user changes its typing to one of the following pure types, according to the terrain as following. Note that in Wi-Fi battles, and therefore in all of Smogon's official metagames, Camouflage will change the user into a Ground-type. Fails if the user's type cannot be changed or if the user is already purely that type.</p>

<ul>
<li>Building/Path: Normal</li>
<li>Sand: Ground</li>
<li>Grass: Grass</li>
<li>Cave/Rock: Rock</li>
<li>Snow/Ice: Ice</li>
<li>Water: Water</li>
<li>Puddles: Ground</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Competitively, Camouflage will always convert the user to the Ground-type. This may have some advantages, for example Starmie can avoid an Electric-type attack in a pinch, but generally there are better ways to spend a turn setting up. After all, you could just use a Ground-type to begin with. Additionally, this move is very poorly distributed; none of the Pokemon that learn this move are especially bulky and none gain any real attacking prowess through changing to the Ground-type. Therefore, though this move may have just a little bit of potential, it should definitely not see any use competitively.</p>
