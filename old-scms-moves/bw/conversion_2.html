[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user's type changes to match a type that resists or is immune to the type of the last move used by one adjacent target, but not either of its current types. The determined type of the move is used rather than the original type. Fails if the user cannot change its type, or if this move would only be able to select one of the user's current types. This move ignores Protect and Detect. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute. If the user is Steel-type and is hit by a Dragon-type attack this move will fail.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Conversion 2 is one of the exclusive moves of the Porygon line. It isn't used in competitive matches because it is really difficult to make it work. Nothing stops your opponent from simply switching moves to one that is more effective against the new type that the user converted to, and the random nature of the move also doesn't help.</p>
