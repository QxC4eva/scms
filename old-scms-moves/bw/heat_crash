<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Emboar is a heavy Pokemon, but it's not quite heavy enough to utilize this attack well. It's only hitting a few Pokemon for that full 120 Base Power, while in return, it's smacking a large number of Steel-types for pitiful damage. Stick with the far more consistent Flare Blitz.</p>
