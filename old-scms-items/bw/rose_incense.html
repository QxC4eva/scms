[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the power of all of the holder's damage-dealing Grass-type attacks by 20%. If Roselia or Roserade breeds while holding Rose Incense, a Budew Egg will be produced as opposed to a Roselia Egg.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rose Incense is practically identical to Miracle Seed, as they both boost Grass-type moves by 20%. In any case, Rose Incense is not used much in competitive battles. It is often outclassed by items such as Choice Band and Choice Specs, which boost the power of physical and special moves by 1.5, respectively, and Life Orb, which boosts the power of all moves by 1.3. Although these three items do come with negative effects, it is generally better to use them over a Rose Incense.</p>
