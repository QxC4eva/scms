
Overview
########


    Crawdaunt has a powerful priority move in Aqua Jet
    Its STABs have good coverage and are boosted by Adaptability
    It has access to a good boosting moves such as Swords Dance and Dragon Dance
    Crawdaunt is extremely frail and has a poor defensive typing with weaknesses to many common types
    It is still held back by its mediocre speed, although Aqua Jet can make up for this slightly
    It faces some competition from Azumarill
    The rain nerf hurts its sweeping potential


Wallbreaker
########
name: Wallbreaker
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Crabhammer
move 3: Aqua Jet
move 4: Crunch / Swords Dance
ability: Adaptability
item: Choice Band / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Spd / 252 Atk
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

    Knock Off is almost as powerful as Crabhammer and has the added benefit of getting rid of the opponent's item
    Crabhammer is significantly more powerful than Aqua Jet and can be used for wallbreaking
    Aqua Jet patches up Crawdaunt's mediocre speed and can be used to clean up the opposing team late game
    Crunch can be used to get past megas such as Mega Venasaur and Mega Blastiose who won't be hit as hard by Knock Off
    Swords Dance can boost Crawdaunt's attack to monstrous levels, especially when backed by Adaptability

Set Details
========

    Maximized Attack with an Adamant nature so Crawdaunt can hit with as much power as possible
    Maximized Speed with a neutral nature allowing Crawdaunt to outspeed un-invested base 86 speeds (most notably Rotom-Wash) by exactly one point
    Choice Band allows Crawdaunt to hit as hard as possible considering if it fails to KO an opponent it most likely won't be able to take a hit back
    Life Orb lets Crawdaunt switch moves while still hitting very hard and pick off pokemon with Aqua Jet after they switch into a Crabhammer or Knock Off


Usage Tips
========

    Don't switch Crawdaunt into an attack unless your confident it can take the hit, instead bring Crawdaunt in through a U-Turn / Volt Switch or after a teammate has been KOed
    Make sure to save Crawdaunt if his Aqua Jet is needed to check a problematic Pokemon to your team
    Don't be afraid to sacrifice Crawdaunt if it means getting past the opponent's defense, as wallbreaking is its primary job
    Against offensive teams it's wise to preserve Crawdaunt as much as possible, as his Aqua Jet can even end up cleaning for you late-game
    Try to bring Crawdaunt in on something that can't do much against it so it can easily set up. Common OU pokemon that Crawdaunt can usually set up against are things like Forretress, Scizor (locked into Bullet Punch or Pursuit), Latios (locked into Psyshock), or anything that looks like it might run in fear of Aqua Jet
    Crawdaunt's goal isn't as much to sweep with Swords Dance as it is to wallbreak, Swords Dance is mainly a filler because of the lack of other options Crawdaunt has


Team Options
========

    Landorus-T has good defensive synergy with Crawdaunt, can set up stealth rock, and can lower the opponent's attack while giving Crawdaunt a free switch in with a slow U-turn
    Politoed can provide rain which significantly powers up Crawdaunt's water STABs
    Thundurus can also provide rain with a prankster Rain Dance, is able to beat Choice Band Azumarill and non-scarfed Keldeo one and one, and spread priority Thunder Wave to help Crawdaunt outspeed certain threats
    Anything that can beat things like Azuamarill, Keldeo, Mega Venusaur, and Chesnaught. Tornadus-T can take them on well and also benefits from rain if Crawdaunt is being run on a rain team. Talonflame is another good answer to these four since all but Azumarill are weak to flying



Other Options
########

    Crawdaunt can try to run a Dragon Dance set. While this may seem like a good idea on paper, it is very hard to pull off because Crawdaunt needs two boosts to outspeed enough threats to sweep and due to Crawdaunt's low bulk it has a lot of trouble getting even one. If you really want to try out Dragon Dance you're best option is switching it with Swords Dance on the Swords Dance set.
    If you are paranoid about the 10% miss of Crabhammer, Waterfall can be use at the cost of 20 base power
    Superpower is an alternative to Crunch when using a Choice Band to hit Ferrothorn a little harder
    Switcheroo can be used on the Choice Band set to attempt to cripple something when Crawdaunt is no longer needed
    Splash Plate can be used over Life Orb to avoid recoil and attempt to bluff a Choice Band


Checks & Counters
########

    Anything that can tank a boosted Crabhammer / Knock Off or outspeed Crawdaunt and take an Aqua Jet are pretty good checks
    As long as Rotom-W has at least 4 speed Evs it can outspeed Crawdaunt and either Will-O-Wisp it or Volt Switch out
    Azumarill, and Keldeo resist Crawdaunt's STABs. However, both are 2HKOed by either Crabhammer or Knock Off as long as Crawdaunt is at +1 or higher (such as a Choice Band)
    Keldeo will always outspeed Crawdaunt, OHKO it, and cannot be 2HKOed by the combination of Crabhammer and Aqua Jet
    Chesnaught is perhaps the best counter to Crawdaunt, as it resists both of Crawdaunt's STABs and can take anything Crawdaunt has to throw at it
    Mega-Venusaur is another good counter to Crawdaunt and with some defensive investment not even the Choice Band set can 2HKO it
    Pokemon such as Vaporean, Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Toxicroak can be annoying to the Choice Band set if they manage to switch in on a Crabhammer or Aqua Jet
