Overview
########
Machamp has access to the combination of Dynamic Punch and No Guard which when combined with his very high attack stat makes him a very annoying pokemon to face. It is also fairly bulky on both sides of the spectrum and has decent coverage in 100% accurate Stone Edge and Ice Punch. The generation shift was a mixed bag for Machamp. On one hand the buff to Knock Off means that he no longer has to rely on Payback for hitting Psychic- and Ghost-type pokemon. With assault vest he becomes very bulky on the special side. But, he also got a new weakness in the Fairy-type which is also resistant to his STAB. Morever strong Flying-type attacks are everywhere in OU which means he has to switch out everytime a user of these moves switces in. He is very slow for an offensive pokemon and is also somewhat outclassed by Conkeldurr in the role of bulky Fighting-type.

Moves
========
Dynamic Punch is a powerful STAB move that hits very hard and confuses the target making it very hard to switch into it. Knock Off is for the Psychic- and Ghost-types and is a very spammable move and cripples any switchin. Stone Edge hits Flying-types very hard and OHKOes Mega Charizard-Y and Talonflane while 2HKOing Gyarados after intimidate and having a very high chance of 2HKOing Togekiss. Ice Punch 2HKOes Gliscor and Landorus-T after intimidate. It also OHKOes garchomp and salamence while 2HKOing Dragonite with multiscale. Bullet Punch is a valuable albeit weak priority move which may come in handy sometimes for killing focus sash users, like, Alakazam or something at very low health but is very weak otherwise. Poison Jab can be used if your team is having problems with fairies.

Set Details
========
No Guard is the only ability Machamp should ever use as it is its only niche. 252 attack EVs with Adamant nature to maximize his attack. 252 HP EVs maximises his bulk and the rest 4 EVs go to speed to outspeed minimum speed Blissey. Assault Vest makes him surprisingly bulky on the special side. He can take a Fire Blast from Mega Charizard-Y in sun and OHKO in return with Stone Edge. +2 Thundurus-I never OHKOes with Thunderbolt while Machamp always OHKOes with Stone Edge. It can also take a surf from +3 Manaphy.

Usage Tips
========
This set works best on balanced teams and works best midgame as a pivot. It is also a very good antilead as Focus Sash Deoxys-S with 252 Special Attack EVs never OHKOes while you kill it with the Knock Off / Bullet Punch combo and against other leads just use dynamic punch.
Midgame, switch in on resisted or weaker attacks and hit hard with Dynamic Punch and watch the target kill itself. If you predict a Ghost- or Psychic-type switchin go for the Knock Off as even if you mispredict something will be crippled. It is also a very spammable move.

Team Options
========
Machamp is wreaked by status, especially, burn. So, something to switch in on will-o-wisp is a good teammate. Talonflame is a good option as it also takes care of Mega Venusaur. Cleric support is also appreciated to keep it healthy and status free. Celebi and Umbreon are good options and have very good synergy with Machamp. A strong Pursuit user which can take care of Ghost- and Psychic-types is very helpful. Heatran and Rotom-W are also good teammates as they can take care of Talonflame which is a big pain for Machmp. Heatran also resists Fairy-type attacks. Machamp has problem breaking through strong physical walls, like, Hippowdon, Skarmory, Slowbro etc. Rotom-W can deal will all of them. Substitute Kyurem-B can also deal with them while also taking care of Mega Venusaur. Aegislash is also a good teammate as it is one of the best switchins to Mega Medicham and the Lati twins.

Other Options
#########
A Guts set can be used but Conkeldurr does it better due to access to STAB priority in Mach Punch. A Choice scarf set can also be used to help mitigate its low speed. A Sub+3 attacks set is also useable but Machamp is too slow to use Substitute before getting hit by a status move. Earthquake can be used on the main set to hit Aegislash without worrying about King's Shield but has no other use.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physically Bulky Pokemon**: Mega-Venusaur fears nothing from Machamp and can use Leech Seed, Sleep Powder, or just hit it with its attacking moves. Hippowdown can switch in easiely as it is only 4HKOed by ice punch and can either set up Stealth Rocks, recover the damage with Slack Off, phase Machamp out, or just 3HKO with Earthquake. Slowbro and Skarmory both have recovery and aren't hit Super Effectively by Dynamic Punch, though Skarmory has to be wary of Roosting if it's faster. Suicune doesn't resist Dynamic Punch but can stall him out of PP thanks to Pressure.

**Burns**: Since Machamp shouldn't be using Guts, Will-o-Wisp cuts its attack stat in half and wears Machamp down quickly due to having no recovery option on the set. Sableye is a very notable user as it is immune to Dynamic Punch and is neutral to Knock Off. 

**Flying-types**: Talonflame and Mega Pinsir can both easily KO with Brave Bird and Aerilate Return, respectively, although they should be wary of switching into Stone Edge. Zapdos resists Dynamic Punch and can PP stall it out with Sub + Roost, as Dynamic Punch has only 4 PP against Zapdos thanks to Pressure, though confusion can foil this strategy and it should be wary of Stone Edge.
