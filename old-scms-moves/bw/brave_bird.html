[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage, and the user receives recoil damage equal to 1/3 of the damage dealt, rounded half up, but not less than 1 HP.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Brave Bird is probably the best physical Flying-type move in the game, with truly excellent Base Power and perfect accuracy. Flying-type moves also have fairly good neutral coverage across all metagames. This allows attackers such as Staraptor to hit incredibly hard, boosted by STAB and Reckless. Though the recoil may take its toll rather quickly, Brave Bird, in combination with Close Combat, may by that time have left huge holes in the opposing team. Other notable users include Skarmory, and Ho-Oh in Ubers.</p>
