<div class="author">By <a href="/forums/members/jukain.77748">Jukain</a>. Updated by <a href="/forums/members/trc.203593/">TRC</a> and <a href="/forums/members/mattl.205566/">MattL</a>. Basis for clauses taken from the <a href="/bw/banlist">BW banlist page</a>.</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Tiers are Smogon's way of categorizing Pok&eacute;mon based on usage. Pok&eacute;mon can be banned from the tier or move up to higher tier from their usage. Typically, they are updated after three months of usage statistics from Smogon's simulator, <a href="/sim/">Pok&eacute;mon Showdown</a>. The standard tiers that are endorsed by Smogon in Gen VI are Ubers, OverUsed (OU), UnderUsed (UU), RarelyUsed (RU), NeverUsed (NU), Little Cup (LC), and Doubles.</p>
    
<h2>Ubers</h2>
    <p>Ubers is the tier above OU. It does not, however, receive any Pok&eacute;mon from OU by usage. Instead, it receives Pok&eacute;mon either through initial placement: Pok&eacute;mon that never see the light of OU, and through banning: Pok&eacute;mon that are deemed to be too powerful for OU. Most of the cover legendaries find themselves in this tier, as they are generally the strongest titans in the games.</p>
    <h3>Play Restrictions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Endless Battle Clause;</strong> Any moveset on any Pok&eacute;mon that is capable of intentionally causing an endless battle is banned from competitive play. Thus:

                <li>A Pok&eacute;mon may not hold a Leppa Berry and carry Recycle and Pain Split on its moveset.</li>
                <li>A Pok&eacute;mon may not hold a Leppa Berry and carry Recycle and Fling on its moveset.</li>
            </ul></li>

<h2>OverUsed</h2>
    <p>OverUsed, or OU, is Smogon's standard tier. The highest level of play is generally seen in this tier, and it is the basis for all other tiers. The most powerful Pok&eacute;mon are banned from this tier up to Ubers. Pok&eacute;mon cannot rise from OU to Ubers based on usage. Most of the cover legendaries in addition to select other Pok&eacute;mon are on the banlist.</p>

<h2>Little Cup</h2>

<h2>Doubles</h2>
    <p>A Smogon brand of Doubles was added to the list of tiers this generation.  It follows standard Smogon clauses and rules, allowing 6 Pok&eacute;mon per team (and in-battle) that can be up to level 100.
