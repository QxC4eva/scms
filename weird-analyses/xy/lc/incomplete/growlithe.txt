Physically Defensive
######## 
name: Physically Defensive 
move 1: Will-O-Wisp 
move 2: Flare Blitz 
move 3: Morning Sun 
move 4: Wild Charge ability: Intimidate 
item: Eviolite 
evs: 116 Atk / 196 Def / 196 SpD 
nature: Careful

Moves
========
Will-O-Wisp gives Growlithe a niche as a very good defensive wall, crippling any Physical attacker with the combination of Will-O-Wisp + Intimidate.
Flare Blitz hits decently powerfully and gives Growlithe a form of attacking.
Morning Sun is Growlithe's form of recovery, being a little bit shaky with it relying on weather.
Wild Charge gives good coverage alongside Flare Blitz, nailing the Water-types that resist Flare Blitz.
Set Details
========
Calm give Growlithe maximum Special Bulk as possible, as with Will-O-Wisp + Intimidate taking care of the physical side, you don't need to run Impish.
The EVs allow Growlithe to reach stats of 22 HP / 19 Def / 22 SpD in conjunction with Eviolite, backed up by Intimidate, making it very bulky.
Eviolite is optimal over Berry Juice as Growlithe has recovery.
Usage Tips 
========
Don't switch in Growlithe on Pawniard or Inkay, as it will give both of them a +1 to Attack, instead of a -1 Attack.
Growlithe can't do anything against Stall teams, as it loses recovery and is worn down easily.
Growlithe can go toe to toe with the best Cleric in the tier, Spritzee, as it only commonly carries Moonblast, which Growlithe resists.
Growlithe serves best after Water-types, especially Chinchou, are removed from the battle, as Growlithe is outsped and KOed by most of them.
Other Fire-types wall Growlithe as well, and most can set up on it.
Growlithe can take on a ton of Physical Pokemon, such as Meditite, while being a threat to them.
Fire now walls Fairy, meaning it can take on Non-Surf Swirlix and Spritzees.
It hates Knock Off, try and keep it away from any Pokemon that commonly carry it.
Team Options 
========
Chinchou makes a great partner, as it can take on the Water-types that give Growlithe trouble, while also taking on Fire-types which Growlithe can't touch, while Growlithe in return can handle Grass-types that give Growlithe problem.
Rapid Spin or Defog support is vital, two prime candidates for these are Tentacool and Vullaby, Vullaby in particular is great as it can handle the Ground-types that give Growlithe problems, but they both share a Rock weakness. Staryu is another good spinner that has great synergy with Growlithe.
Heal Bell and Wish support is greatly appreciated, as it will be switching a lot, a great partner is Spritzee, who has decent synergy with Growlithe.
Combining Growlithe with Snubbull or Scraggy forms a devastating combination of double Intimidates, softening up any Physical attackers a lot.
Vulpix is a good partner, as it powers up Growlithe's Flare Blitz for it and making Morning Sun recover even more.
Most Grass-types also get good synergy, handling Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type Pokemon, while Growlithe can take on the Ice- and Bug-types that threaten Grass-types in return.
Other Options 
########
Flash Fire can be used if you are desperate for a way to stop Fire-types, but it generally isn't worth it.
Roar can phase opponents, but Growlithe struggles for moveslots as it is, and every move is vital, it does have a niche of stopping Torchic chains, which are easily set up against Growlithe.
Flame Charge can boost its Speed to attempt a sweep, but its niche is being defensive, not offensive, if it chooses to run this set, it should run Flame Charge / Flare Blitz / Wild Charge / Close Combat, but it is mostly outclassed by Ponyta, but Groqlithe has a niche of being able to set up much easier thanks to Intimidate, and it has Close Combat to get through Rock-types, which Ponyta cannot do.
A Choice Band set has some merit, as it does turn Growlithe into a fearsome attacker, but that is better left to other Pokemon.
Close Combat gets great coverage, but it isn't optimal as it lowers your defenses.
Howl is Growlithe's only way to boost its Attack, but it often isn't worth it.
A Special set could be used, but again, it is outclassed by something else, and Growlithe has a tiny Special movepool.
Fire Blast and Flamethrower can be used as alternatives to Flare Blitz, as Growlithe doesn't enjoy recoil too much.
Toxic can be used on a stallier set.
Thief can be used to steal opponent's items if they choose to Knock Off Growlithe's precious Eviolite.
Sunny Day can give its Flare Blitz a lot more power and its Morning Sun a lot more healing, but it isn't worth a moveslot most of the time.
Justified has a small niche of getting a +1 for switching in to a Knock Off.
Checks & Counters 
########
Sand removes its recovery and leaves it prone to being worn down, as does Hail.
While obscure, Numel is the best counter to Growlithe, as Growlithe cannot do anything at all too it.
Bulky Water-types and Chinchou completely ruin Growlithe
Most Special attackers can come in on a Will-O-Wisp and KO Growlithe.
Hippopotas is a check at best, as it hates the residual damage of Will-O-Wisp, but it can set up all over Growlithe.
Timburr doesn't mind Burn thanks to Guts, so it can switch in and get a boost with ease.
Gligar can outspeed and KO, but it, like Hippopotas, doesn't like being burned.
Other Fire-types wall it, but Growlithe can wall them in return, so it is pretty much a stalemate.
Stealth Rock, along with the other hazards, leave Growlithe prone to being worn down quickly.
