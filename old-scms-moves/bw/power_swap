<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Swaps the user's Attack and Special Attack stat changes with the target's. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>One use of this move is to use a power-cutting attack, such as Leaf Storm and Overheat, and then use Power Swap to transfer the stat drop to the opponent. The Exeggcute, Tangela, and Vulpix evolutionary lines have access to this combo. A combo with Superpower could also work, but unfortunately nothing has such a combo.</p>
