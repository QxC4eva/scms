<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Introduction: Hello team raters! New RMT after a very long time of not posting one here. A lot of teams recently have been all "hey i got this thing and it will sweep with this other shit support" but meh i cant be arsed to make one of those, specially when other guys already used the cool ideas! So instead of that, I decided to build a completely standard team, cover threats while being able to sweep is this team's "purpose" (notice how this is every team's purpose, lol so standard). Theres 1 pokemon that caught my eye some time ago, and I really fucking wanted to use it so much... after like 4 attempts at teams using it, I think I finally made one of the best teams I have ever built. Easily, this team covers pretty much every single threat on the metagame, it will be very hardly swept by something when used correctly (although combos of 3 or 4 pokes can be very hard to deal with but that happens with every team since this is DPP!). Aaaanyways, this team has proved very succesful this days, aquiring a leaderboard place of #6 (#3 without counting the glitched accounts) and defeating a lot of good players in the way. Although im pretty sure this team has reached its "rot" point, where it cant be improved a lot more, im open to every single suggestion you give me, and ill try it out seriously (except shit like i dont know Victreebel or Arbok). In case you havent noticed, this team is purely offensive, while the backbone being literally bulky things that can take hits for each teammate. I play very offensively with this team, since im a true believer of high risk high reward!</p>

<p>Main "issue" for this team is without doubt stall teams. The main thing that hurts me against Stall is Spikes, those layers are the most annoying shit ever. However, theres one thing in the team that can change a lost battle in a win situation for me, which is a perfectly timed Explosion on my opponent's Blissey. If that happens, a win chance is really big. </p>

<p>Without anything else to add, I introduce you, Smogon user, to my newest team, Heavenly Star!</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/376.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Metagross</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 200 HP / 232 Atk / 44 SpD / 32 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- Meteor Mash<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>First player to come is the mighty MetaReverbChickens. Leading position is crucial in this metagame where every team tries to get the advantage since the start of the match, either being anti leadng their opponents, getting SR up while surviving most assaults, or suicide leading to get momentum. In my opinion, this lead is the best one in this metagame. DPP is really fucking full of Smeargles and Roserades everywhere (thanks Vashta, Jabba and KG/August u_u), which means your team should not let them set-up. This is what Metagross does, completely stops any set-up from those kind of pokemons (specially smeargle since this team hates spikes), takes on every single lead comfortably, barring the rare Heatran and the occasional Infernape, and can get SR up as well. SR is tremendously important for the team, since it causes a lot of switches more often than not, which is why I was so skeptical about having a SR lead. </p>

<p>These moves were picked for 1 single reason: fucking sensuality. I really dislike Explosion, since giving a free double switch may put me at such a big disadvantage, that I may lose just for that stupidity. Earthquake lets me totally handle other Metagross leads, as well as other Steel types, and is picked for straight coverage. Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch is for Azelf, Aerodactyl, and any other suicide lead that hopes beating MetaNite & Reverb. The EVs seem weird at a glance (lol they are!) but its really just to never be OHKOd my Timid's Azelf Fire Blast, while having tremendous firing power, excellent defensive capabilities, and decent speed. So many speed was invested so I can beat most Metagross leads, which is crucial in the way I play this lead, since it lets me win momentum so damn easily that it is like total magic.</p>

<p>Usually Metagross is not sacked. I save it because later in the game it may become really useful, would it be to take a Draco Meteor, revenge some dangerous sweeper with Bullet Punch, or hurting things like Scizors, who knows, but Metagross is not only useful at the beginning of the battle, but its a true contender at any phase of it.</p>

<p><strong>Suicune</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 160 HP / 120 SpA / 228 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Surf<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Hidden Power Electric</p>

<p>This was the pokemon that inspired the team. I was like "holy shat i need a team with 3 attack CM Suicune NOW!" and so I kept trying to make one. Finally got it done!! Anyways, Suicune, the most solid beast comes here to my team doing a very important job. It becomes fucking hard to take down after a Calm Mind. It becomes fucking strong and can sweep you after a Calm Mind. Its hot and fucking sexy even before a Calm Mind.
Suicune adds a Fire resistance to the team, considering how 2 of my main pokes are weak to it. Its also an excellent counter to Heatran, specially non-scarfed ones. It counters DD Gyara, some Metagross, Scizor, and more with ease. It Calm Minds on a fuckload of things including Bullet Punches, Vaporeons, Perts, Gliscors, Fire Types, Ice Types and company.</p>

<p>Even with its not-so-amazing special attack, Suicune can rip holes through teams, usually making a sweep by itself, or letting a teammate finish the job. Its seriously incredible how many teams are weak to this thing because every single time a suicune appears it 'must' be a Crocune or a Rest Sleep Talk variant with another move. Surprise factor and overall bulkyness and sweeping prowess is what makes this set worth its weight in gold. When this broski doesnt manage a complete sweep its either because of Blissey, getting Tricked by something like Latias (Latias dies of course), or its at 30%~ and something like Gengar comes in to OHKO me. </p>

<p>The set is pretty easy to understand. Surf is STAB, and after a Calm Mind it does big, BIG numbers to everything that does not resist it, barring something like Blissey or max/max Cresselia. Offensive teams are eaten by this beast's Surfs. The mighty Scizor takes around 70% from a +1 Surf, and can only do around 50% back to my Suicune with Choice Band max U-Turn. Thats how bulky and strong this thing is. Ice Beam is purely coverage move. Denting things like Celebi that want to wall my "Crocune" and then get 2HKOd by +1 Ice Beam. It also hits Salamence and the other dragonic friends. HP Electric is in my last slot because its what makes this set extremely beast. When you see a Suicune rampaging, most people go ahead and throw out a Vaporeon, Gyarados, or any other Bulky Water that can resist the combo of Ice + Water. This is where HP Electric shines. OHKOing Gyarados when at +1, taking advantage of the inability of those other waters to touch me at all (besides the rare toxic) and seting up more Calm Minds to finally sweep. Calm Mind is the "duh" move in this set that makes it as strong as a fucking truck.</p>

<p>Enough speed to beat maxed Mamoswine, and it can also oftenly outrun a lot of Mixmences, which is excellent. It also beats Heatrans, which means if I get a scarf tricked, not everything is lost and can prove useful late game.</p>

<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 160 HP / 176 Atk / 148 SpD / 24 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Pursuit</p>

<p>Im somewhat original with my teams but hey this little bitch is a must on most teams with revenge killing issues. Scizor is my main answer to shit like DD Mence (when it gets at 60%~), Gengar, Kingdras, Tyranitars, Latias, and shit, you get the point. Thanks to his bazillion resistances and his decent defenses, it can switch in on a fuckload of things, like Scarf Latias, and pursuit her to dead, opening an easier path for Cuney Cune. Scizor, as my second Dragon attack absorber, also carries a pesky Fire Weakness, which is why there are a fuckload of fire resistances in the team (hint: 3), but its totally worth it. Besides countering all those shit i listed, and offering me a good revenge killer, it can also do something that my team adores. Scouting with U-Turn. This lets me see if my opponent has Heatran, Skarmory or some other shit, which lets me plan what im going to do nextly in the match, specially since most things that switch in on Scizor are set-up fodder for Suicune.</p>

<p>The set is the standard one, with BP to 2HKO every offensive mon that does not resist it. U-Turn is the scouting move that is always spammed when I play, so I can start seeing what my opponent has to show. Pursuit lets both Suicune and Heatran sweep easier, thanks to the ability of shoting Gengar, Latias, Starmie and most shit that is weak to it. Superpower is all coverage move, to OHKO things like locked Heatran or a Scizor, but i see myself spamming U-turn even in those situations. EVs are just to take hits from both sides nicely, while having max attack. </p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Hidden Power Grass</p>

<p>Ohohohohoho its Heatraaaan! This thing is what makes me not weak to another Heatrans spamming Fire Blast during the match. Heatran can be considered the complete glue of the team, since it does so much for it that is too hard to write everything here. First of all it attracts Vaporeons like nobody, which means Suicune's time to set-up has begun. It also can 1 shot Swampert, who otherwise becomes a total pain in the ass for the team. Another steel type here means that Dragon attacks arent going to completely own me, while the Fire type gets me excellent resistances. First of all, what does this do? Well it switches in on Celebi, Scizor and company like no-one, threatens them to OHKO with Flamethrower and also works as a pivot, since a lot of Heatrans carry sub, it may spell dead if they switch out. Another selling point is the lack of Leftovers. This is excellent since I often can bluff a scarf, and make the whole match come into my way until I attack. Example: When Celebi switches out to Heatran to absorb a Flamethrower, and it doesnt see anything, it can oftenly be confused as a Scarf Heatran. My opponent, knowing I have a scarf, uses Fire Blast to hit my switchin instead of using Earth Power to sodomize my Volcanic beast. This means I stay, get a Flash Fire boost, OHKO the opponent's Heatran AND be at a high amount of HP. This happens a lot of times so believe me im not making this up. Heatran also becomes the one of 2 things in my team that can stand a bulky SD Scizor assault, which is tremendously helpful. </p>

<p>The moves and EVs are pretty straightforward. Max spa and speed for offensive strongth, Naive nature is picked so Explosion can OHKO max/max Blissey even without SR up, which means Suicune and Latias may have a god damn party. Flamethrower > Fire Blast because... yeah... i find Fire Blast missing more than Jirachi getting 15 flinches, so id rather have the reliability, although having Fire Blast would be excellent to 1 shot Salamence after SR and with a Flash Fire boost, but whatever it may miss and Mence is left with all its HP! Earth Power is a coverage move, you all know what it hits I assume so ill skip it, and HP Grass OHKOs Swampert, which is something extremely needed on this team. It also can 2HKO a Suicune after SR and leave more paths open for a sweep. Explosion is for Blissey and my general oh-shit button to 1 shot most of the metagame.</p>

<p><strong>Gliscor</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sand Veil<br />
EVs: 240 HP / 16 Atk / 32 Def / 220 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Roost<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>After having 4 dudeys in my team, the Lucario problem was unbelievable. Only Suicune could stand against Adamant ones, because of outspeeding and the ability of 2HKOing if the Lucario went smart and tried to SD. So this spot was basically much a must. Gliscor makes a nice stall-breaker thanks to Taunt, which is nice in case something goes wrong, like Blissey evading my Explosion with Protect or a switch to Rotom. Gliscor gives me an excellent check for Lucario, Scizor, Tyranitar and all those little physical fags that cant hit me super effectively. Excellent team player here because it absorbs Fighting, Ground and Bug attacks like no-one, and has a really nice synergy with Suicune, since it attracts all kinds of bulky waters that will let me get some free calm minds. Gliscor also lures in Celebi, getting a Taunt on it, and allowing Heatran to switch in without the risks of Thunder Wave/Leech Seed. Gliscor, while beaing the things that stops 3 common threats from sweeping me, is also somewhat of a weak link. Why? Well even with StoneQuake combo, it becomes set-up fodder for a lot of Pokemons. Taunt fixes this somewhat, and having Latias on the guard also lets me survive most set-up sweepers assaults, but I dislike how much Gliscor has to switch or get OHKOd by Ice or Water thingies. Of course, all of my team helps Gliscor in these strange cases, and Gliscor's bulkyness, defensive capabilities and amazing typing make up totally for those little facts i said about it.</p>

<p>The moveset is the standard wall breaker, that lets me beat stall more often than not. Combinated with Latias to stop Gyarados and trick Blissey, Gliscor is delightfully strong. Taunt is a must on the set as explained above, while Earthquake, being the best attacking move coupled with STAB, makes a must on this set as well. Roost gives me a lot of survability, completely letting me take a hit, roost, and come back later for a next round. Stone Edge is the last move here mainly because it can hit fliers like Salamence, Togekiss and most importantly, Skarmory. With Taunt, and most Skarms carrying Shed Shell, Gliscor can eventually come out on top. Although Stone Edge has worked decently with the time, I think im going to replace it with U-Turn, since a lot of people have told me that and im too lazy to try it out lol. A second U-Turner could be really good for me, so if enough people think i should make the change, ill totally try it out. The EVs arent weird at all. Speed lets me beat even Jolly Lucario, and I gave it a little bit more for speed tie issues that can become quite the pain, like vs Calm Mind Jirachi. HP is nearly maxed for good defenses, while the rest of the EVs are splitted to have 4 Attack points and some more Defense.</p>

<p><strong>Latias</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Surf<br />
- Trick</p>

<p>This thing is the complete backbone of the team. Thanks to it blinding speed, coupled with the scarf, you got a freakingly fast poke that hits hard enough and has excellent coverage with 3 moves. Latias is my answer to shit like DD Mence, DD Kingdra, DD Gyarados, and a fantastic revenge killer of sorts. Only drawback of this spot is how easily it is pursuited, usually leaving me in a tight spot, but the ability to take on most foes, while totally helping Gliscor with shit that bothers it, the move Trick to make stall easier to beat, AND important resistances, like a third Fire one, make Latias an excellent member of this team. Main Infernape, Heatran and company counter is worth to note here as well. As said before, this shit gets Pursuited more than Miley Cyrus by horny teenagers, because holy fuck more often than not Latias will kill 1 poke, I get happy, and then a shit ass Scizor/Ttar comes in my ass and spoils my fun. Even when I would love to not be such Pursuit bait, Latias does so much that its almost impossible to change.</p>

<p>Draco Meteor is pimp STAB that hits nearly everything and threatens a fuckload of shit, Thunderbolt hits Gyarados and water bitches, while Surf hits Heatran and Fire types. Trick is an excellent move because not only it gives me a great chance to beat Stall, but it also makes me not weak to shit like CM Suicune and Cursers. 252 Speed and Attack are pretty "duh" so I hope you understand their point!</p>
