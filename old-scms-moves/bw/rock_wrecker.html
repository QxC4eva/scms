<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Provided the move hits, the user must recharge the following turn, and may not attack or switch.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>If Rock Wrecker existed in RBY, it might have been good. Alas, being forced into one turn of doing absolutely nothing is an extremely dangerous risk, giving the opponent one precious extra turn to execute his or her general strategy. The fact that its two users are both slow with crippling type weaknesses makes it absolutely suicidal for either of them to use it. In fact, there are more powerful, far less risky moves than this. To put things into perspective, Rhyperior's Rock Wrecker is slightly weaker than Medicham's High Jump Kick. There are stronger moves in all the tiers above RU (mostly due to weather boosts), and there are certainly similarly powerful moves even in RU and NU that are much safer than Rock Wrecker. Rhyperior should stick to using Stone Edge or Rock Blast instead.<p>
