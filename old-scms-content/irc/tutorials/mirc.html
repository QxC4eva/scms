<p>mIRC is an easy to use Windows <strong>I</strong>nternet <strong>R</strong>elay <strong>C</strong>hat client. This tutorial is here to help you install, set up, and run mIRC.</p>

<h2>1. Downloading</h2>

<p>Users can download mIRC <a href="http://www.mirc.com/get.php?version=635">here</a>. Should the main link fail, select a <a href="http://mirc.com/get.php">mirror site</a>. A mirror site will be automatically selected for you to download. Be sure to remember where you saved your file.</p>

<h2>2. Installing</h2>

<p>Open the mIRC installer. It is a simple self install. Select "Full" if you have never installed mIRC before. If you have downloaded and installed mIRC, select "Upgrade", and be sure that the check box for backing up scripts is selected.</p>

<h2>3. Configuration</h2>

<p>Open up mIRC. A pop-up will appear that says you need to register mIRC. You don't have to though. No features are disabled whether you register mIRC or not. That pop-up will disappear if you register though. Moving on, this screen will load once the pop-up goes away.</p>

<p>To join a channel, type /join #channel. So, to join #pokemon, we type in this: /join #pokemon. It's advisable to join this channel to immerse yourself in our community as much as possible.</p>

<p>#Pokemon has put up a small security measure to prevent bots from flooding the channel. So, when you try to join these channels, it will not let you join until you have registered a nickname. To register a nickname, type <kbd>/ns register <var>password</var> <var>e-mail</var></kbd>. <var>password</var> is a five letter or more case sensitive password. <var>e-mail</var> is a legitimate e-mail address. This is very important, as an activation key will be sent to you. You will then need to enter that activation key to finish registering. If a nickname is already registered, you must choose a different nickname to register.</p>

<p>You can now enter #Pokemon. Enjoy chatting, and follow the rules!</p>
