</p>Smogon Tour is one of the most prestigious and fun tournaments held on Smogon. It is held twice every year. 3 live tours are held every week. They can be of any of the OU tiers ofthe 3 most recent generations of Pokemon. Players are awarded points, based on their performance in the tours. After 9 weeks, the top 16 players qualify for the playoffs. It started on September 5th, with a XY OU tour. So, let's move onto the coverage.</p>

<h3>Week 1 - XY OU #1</h3>

<p>Hosted by user Funkasaurus, the inaugural tour of this season saw a great turnout with 128 participants signing-up for it. Of those, McMeghan, Rewer, Stathakis, and Conflict reached the semifinals. In the first semifinal, Stathakis defeated Rewer, making it to the finals. McMeghan defeated Conflict in the second semifinal. McMeghan was put on defensive early on by Conflict's Excadrill and Nasty Plot Life Orb Thundurus. However, McMeghan was able to wear them out with clever switching and racking up Life Orb damage. He was also aided by luck , when Thundurus missed 2 consecutive Focus Blasts. You can watch the replay <a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/smogtours-ou-20594">here</a>. The final match was a pretty poor matchup for Stathakis as his Scolipede was almost useless due to the defensive nature of McMeghan's team. He also did not have a switchin for Latios; this was compounded by the fact that McMeghan was running Roost on it, allowing it recover the Life Orb recoil and residual damage. McMeghan got a convincing win in this match, reaffirming his first place on the Smogon tournament rankings.

<h3>Week 1 - XY OY #2</h3>

<p>This tour was hosted by aim and saw an even greater turnout with 192 participants. Bad Ass, Alf', and Inflikted emerged as the finalists. Bad Ass defeated gr8astard in the penultimate round, while Inflikted and Alf' defeated mien and Bloo respectively. In the first final, Inflikted defeated Alf' in a close game, with his Mega Pinsir putting in some major work early mid-game. However, Alf bounced back, and managed to set up a Swords Dance with his Hawlucha. Unfortunately for Alf', Inflikted's Mew was able to survive with 8% HP remaining, and went on to remove Alf's Hawlucha and beat his Rotom-W with a combination of Taunt and burn damage. You can watch the replay <a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/smogtours-ou-20949">here</a>. In the match between Alf' and Bad Ass, Alf' managed to burn Bad Ass's Jirachi, his main switchin against Alf's Mega Gardevoir, allowing Gardevoir to do some serious work later on in the match, weakening Bad Ass's Slowbro, which allowed Hawlucha to sweep later on. You can watch the replay <a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/smogtours-ou-20935">here</a>. In the third final, Bad Ass forfeited the match, giving Inflikted the win.</p>
<h3>Week 1 - XY OU #3</h3>

<p>This tour was hosted by sapientia, and 178 people signed-up for it. 14 byes were given. Destiny Device, pokebasket and xray managed to reach finals. The match between pokebasket and Destiny Device was a very long one, with both parties trying to outplay each other .Destiny Device was using a semi stall team with some unusual sets such as defensive Infernape and Doublade. There were many switches in the early- an mid-game. Destiny Device got the first blood on turn 58 when he KOed pokebasket's Heatran with his +1 Gardevoir. He KOed pokebasket's Azumarill too on the next turn. This gave Destiny Device the opening he needed to win the game. You can watch the replay <a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/smogtours-ou-21296">here</a>. In the game between pokebasket and xray, pokebasket's Mega Venusaur walled half of xray's team, giving him the advantage early game. By the time xray KOed it, the damage had been done, and pokebasket won the game. You can watch the replay of this game <a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/smogtours-ou-21290">here</a>. In the final game of the finals, xray was put at an early disadvantage when his Azumarill was burnt due to Keldeo's Scald. xray's Latios was also burnt due to Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp. Thus, both of Keldeo's counters were greatly crippled early in the game; Destiny Device capitalized on that and went on to win the game and the tour too.

<p>That's all for now ladies and gentlemen. If you are planning to participate in later tours, good luck. You will need it.</p>
