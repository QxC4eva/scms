<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I decided to post and share my team that has been successful for quite awhile. It's been quite a journey creating and re-creating this team until finally I had a finished product, that I considered my style of offense. I use to run semi-stall teams before Latias got booted to ubers, but I never felt too comfortable with semi-stall, until one day I decided to go back to my roots and create an offensive team. This team was created about two months ago and I began laddering to find some major holes and I began replacing some original members that were simply not worthy to be in the team. Basically, I'm retiring this team since 5th Gen is right around the corner. This team peaked #21 on the OU Leaderboard, with 1524 CRE under the username "-Vacancy", the team had an excellent win ratio and it was consistent, which is important to be a good team. The team has done very well in tournaments like Smogon Tour. I based my team around my favorite band As I Lay Dying, and you can obviously notice by my Shoddy username. I couldn't think of a better way to have my favorite team along with a kick ass band in a thread.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Azelf</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 144 Atk / 112 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Trick<br />
- Zen Headbutt<br />
- Explosion</p>

<p>Azelf is the best example of a reliable lead and consistent, its job is to hit hard and U-Turn away fast. With Choice Band it puts quite the hurt against many leads. The reason I have Ice Punch is to get the quick OHKO on lead Dragonite and Gliscor which are still common leads. No one ever expects it, and all I do is smirk. It's powerful Explosion is able to take out the most defensive pokemon in the game like Skarmory and lead Metagross. 
Azelf is a nice partner to Flygon and these two share important roles in securing a promising sweep.</p>

<p><strong>Flygon</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD  / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Outrage</p>

<p>Flygon the weakest yet the best scouting dragon this game has to offer. It's typing is astounding, immunity to Thunder Wave and ground moves is awesome. Scarf Flygon is my clean up pokemon, once everythings weakened, Flygon will pick pokemon apart with either EQ or Outrage. An excellent revenge killer and it remains a huge threat in the metagame.</p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Shuca Berry<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 32 HP / 252 SpA / 224 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Will-o-Wisp</p>

<p>Heatran the pokemon who sets up rocks and can fend for itself with the help of Shuca Berry. I run modest for the extra boost in power, and I find it really dumb to run Naive and lowering its great special defense just to speed tie other Heatran's. 
394 SpA is powerful and hits like a truck, I usually switch this guy into a Rotom's Shadow Ball, and I retaliate with a Fire Blast. Definitely Heatran has an important role in this team, and Flygon really appreciates its steel typing.</p>

<p><strong>Suicune</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 32 HP / 252 SpA / 224 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Hidden Power Electric<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Hydro Pump</p>

<p>Offensive Suicune poses as a huge threat when it sets up freely with one or two Calm Minds. This is the standard offensive Cune and max speed is necessary to speed tie against other Suicunes. Suicune forces a lot of switches especially because most players might assume its Cro-Cune. Hydro Pump literally wrecks anything that comes in or stays in, barring Vaporeon of course (Water Absorb). Yet, Suicune is a powerful special sweeper on its own and can be a monster when played correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Breloom</strong> @ Toxic Orb<br />
Ability: Poison Heal<br />
EVs: 236 HP / 252 Atk / 20 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Spore<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Seed Bomb<br />
- Focus Punch</p>

<p>Breloom, what can I say you are a complete asshole sometimes but its a damn good one. It's trademark set which is the Spore Puncher, it brings a lot to the table. A physical beast that I use to quickly sleep a pokemon after I U-Turned with either Azelf or Flygon and I get to safely sub up and start wrecking shit. With stealth rock on the field, some pokemon who wouldn't be OHKO'd can now be taken out with the help of 25%. 
Breloom is a major asset to the team, and thus I believe it can't be replaced under any circumstance. Breloom's ev's are meant to be more bulky and to take better hits.</p>

<p><strong>Jirachi</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Serene Grace<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Hidden Power Ground<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Psychic</p>

<p>Jirachi like I mentioned before is the Most Valuable Pokemon (MVP) to the team. 
Why? It just can't be tamed under a substitute and a Calm Mind under its belt. It's so anti-stall that I simply love how quickly it can tear apart teams. I run Timid nature to outspeed Jolly Lucario and Timid Roserade. Jirachi is my Lucario counter and I always save it late game, since my opponents reveal Luke towards the end. I love using Jirachi and its just a beast.</p>
