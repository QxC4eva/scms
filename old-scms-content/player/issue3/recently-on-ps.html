        <h4>Lobby Update, PSPL II and OLT</h4>

        <p class="publication-info">By <a href="/forums/members/sirdonovan.195200/">sirDonovan</a> on September 25, 2014
        </p>

        <p>As you may have noticed, the Lobby has had a small update regarding staff. Similar to other rooms on the server, it now has its own roomauth. You should only contact global staff for issues outside of the Lobby as room staff members do not have global authority. A client update is planned to help distinguish between these two groups.

        </p>

        <p>No, it's not your imagination. Chrome recently made fonts look slightly smaller, so I'm making the chat font size slightly bigger (from 8pt to 9pt).
        </p>

        <p>If you don't like it, give yourself a week to get used to it. Plenty of other things on your computer have different font sizes. In a week, I'll decide if we need to do anything else about it.
