User cannot move next turn, unless opponent or Substitute was KOed.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>User cannot attack or switch next turn. If a Pokémon is knocked out by Hyper Beam, the user will be able to attack or switch the following turn. The same applies if Hyper Beam misses or breaks a Substitute. In Pokémon Stadium, after Hyper Beam is used, the user must always take one turn to recharge, unless it is the last move used in the match.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Probably the single best attack in RBY. Since critical hits happen often and fainting an opponent will make it so you don't need to recharge, this move is the perfect finishing move that will easily take 50% or more of a Pokemon's health in a single hit. Most Pokemon should have this move in their movepool when available, especially physical attackers.</p>
