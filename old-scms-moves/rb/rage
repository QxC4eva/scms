[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack one stage when hit between using Rage, and as long as it is in the effect of Rage. User can only use Rage and cannot switch. Attack is not increased by damage dealt from a status. If the user is put to sleep, paralyzed, frozen, or has Rage Disabled, it will continue using Rage after its effect has resolved. If the user hits itself while it is confused, it will still use Rage. If Rage misses the first time it is use, then the Pok√©mon will be allowed to choose a different move. If the user is targeted by Disable, its Rage will build.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rage should not be used competitively. Its Base Power is far too low to start off with, and it is completely outclassed by stronger Normal-type moves such as Body Slam and Double-Edge.</p>
