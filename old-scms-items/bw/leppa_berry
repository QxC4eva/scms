<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Restores 10 PP to a move that has run out of PP. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Fighting-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Leppa Berry is famed for being part of the endless-stall trick that constitutes any Pokemon with both Leppa Berry and Recycle or Harvest - you can keep bringing Leppa Berry back, and it will repeatedly be able to restore 10 PP to your moves, which means that your Pokemon will never be forced to Struggle. Of course, this tactic is never used as it is quite rare for any Pokemon to run out of PP in any metagame, even when stalling, before it runs out of HPâ€”though this is admittedly a fear for some low-PP moves, it does not necessitate Leppa Berry, as the general rule of thumb to follow is "hit them hard, and you won't need to hit them often." Hence, Life Orb or a Choice item will almost always be seen over Leppa Berry, even where low-PP moves are concerned.</p>

<p>Still, if you are ever unlucky enough to find yourself and your opponent down to your last two Harvest Leppa Berry Exeggutor with Synthesis, Substitute, Leech Seed, and Protect each... well, you'd better pack a sleeping bag, because that battle isn't ending any time soon.</p>
