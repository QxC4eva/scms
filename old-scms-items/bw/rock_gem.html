<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder uses a damage-dealing Rock-type move, then the holder consumes this item and the power of that move is increased by 50%. One-time use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In single battles, Rock Gem is not typically a useful item, unfortunately. While the one-time boost to Rock-type attacks is nice, most Pokemon using Rock-type attacks would rather have the more reliable power of Life Orb or Choice items. A very notable exception, however, is Substitute + Swords Dance Terrakion, who requires the power from Rock Gem to enable its STAB Stone Edge to OHKO its most dangerous counters, such as Gliscor and Slowbro, after a boost, as Choice items cannot be used for obvious reasons, and Life Orb doesn't cut it for power.</p>

<p>Typically Gems are more valuable in the VGC and similar environments, and Rock Gem is often used here to boost the power of Rock-type attacks such as Rock Slide from Pokemon such as Kabutops and Gigalith, which is useful thanks to Rock Slide's spread-damage effect. The one-time power boost can come in very useful in such a fast-paced metagame, especially as it comes without any drawbacks.</p>
