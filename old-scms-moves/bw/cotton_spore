<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Speed by two stages. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Cotton Spore is not a very common move. Even though the benefits are reasonably good, most users of this move are Grass-types, who are better off using other moves such as Stun Spore or Sleep Powder, which give bigger benefits in the end. Also, all the opponent has to do to negate the drops is to switch out, and can use the turn that you used for Cotton Spore to deal serious damage. Note that Cotton Spore's accuracy increased to 100% this generation.</p>
