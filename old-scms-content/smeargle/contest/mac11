Monthly Art Contest #11: Weather
[head]

[page]

<p>With a theme so general as 'Weather', you might expect the pool of submissions to be highly varied and eclectic. In that case, you would be correct. It would also be understandable if you were to assume, as a result of the variation in pieces, that the poll would be fairly evenly-distributed among the contestants. In that case, however, you would be oh so <i>oh so</i> wrong. MAC #11 went decidedly to long-time entrant SoIheardyoulikeSENTRET, who sprinted away with the trophy at a phenomenal 47 votes. For comparison, the next person in line obtained 7 votes.</p>
