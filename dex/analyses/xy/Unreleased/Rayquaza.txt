name: 1 [ORAS] SD Mega Rayquaza
item: Jade Orb
ability: Air Lock
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Dragon Ascent
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Extreme Speed

Rayquaza gets a badass 115 speed, allowing you to outspeed pretty much every Uber Dragon not named Mega Salamence or Dragon Arceus.. This also makes Swords Dance a lot more deadly. Dragon Ascent is your main stab, and it hits like a truck, with only defense and special defense going down. Earthquake hits steels like Dialga and Heatran, plus it hits Primal Groudon a bit harder than Dragon Ascent. ExtremeSpeed lets you clean teams, but note that Life Orb Rayquaza has a stronger Extremespeed.

name: 2 [ORAS] DD Mega Rayquaza
item: Jade Orb
ability: Air Lock
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Jolly
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Dragon Ascent
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Draco Meteor / Dragon Claw 

Probably not as good of a sweeper as the Swords Dance set, but this does allow Mega Rayquaza to outspeed some serious stuff such as Arceus, Mega Salamence, Choice Scarfers like Xerneas, etc.  Earthquake still 2HKOs Primal Groudon after boost so thats nice. Draco Meteor lets you smack Dragons such as Palkia without a boost, and also does over 60% to Primal Groudon switch-ins. Dragon Claw if you don't want to go mixed and just wanna smash Palkia and Zekrom's face in. If you don't care about Dragons, you can run Extremespeed for some priority in a pinch.

Set

name: 3 [ORAS Doubles] Mega Rayquaza
item: Jade Orb
ability: Air Lock
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Dragon Ascent
move 3: Extreme Speed
move 4: Protect / Earthquake / V-create

DD set for Doubles. Use with Follow Me/pair with stuff that beats Steels. You can run V-create but that's not too conducive to sweeping. Togekiss is an excellent Follow Me partner because Delta Stream eliminates its Rock/Ice/Electric weaknesses. Jirachi is nice too.
