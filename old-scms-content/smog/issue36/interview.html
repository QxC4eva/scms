<div id="interview">

  <div class="aside"><p>I awake with a start in the middle of the night, trying to remember the dream I just had.</p><p>"What the heck? Was I dreaming I was trapped in a toaster?"</p><p>Just then I get an email on my phone saying I'm needed in Ohio, first thing in the morning, but with no sender indicated.</p><p>"Who-?"</p><p>Another email pops up with the message "Oh I forgot to mention, welcome back to the interviewing team."</p><p>"O, well then. I guess. I'm unemployed at the moment anyhow, I suppose."</p><p>The next morning I find myself in the forgotten and mysterious land of Ohio outside a house peculiarly shaped like a loaf of bread. I ring the doorbell and am greeted by a gentlemen wearing loafers. He invites me into the living room. I look around to make sure that there aren't any other bread jokes to be made and I begin the interview.</p></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />OK, let's start with who you are and what you do in real life.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />Well, my real name is Matt and I'm a web programmer.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Now, when you say web programmer, what does that normally entail?</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />I create websites from start to finish. I have at least a little artistic talent so I come up with a design and write the presentation code that you're used to seeing around here. I also work on the server side to create all of those things that you don't see but are crucial for a large website to function.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Tell me a bit about you personally. What do you like to do outside of the internet?</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />There's a world outside of the internet? Haha.</div>

  <div class="aside">The abundance of long-dead computers stacked in the corner of the room begins to make sense.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />Sometimes I feel like there isn't. For some reason I like to stay busy, but I also like to complain about being too busy. I have a puppy to spend a lot of time with. She's going through agility training. And a house to work on. My personality offline is pretty much the same. I try to present myself as exactly who I am and nothing else.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Hey, me too. :></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />I'd really like to see you make that face, then. :P</div>

  <div class="aside"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/2h4nmD9.png">So he wishes.</a></div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />9.9 Anybody special in your life aside from the puppy?</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />Indeed. I've actually been married for about a year now. We've been together for.. like 6 and a half, I think?</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />oooo.</div>

  <div class="aside">Images of Toast being buttered by his wife flash in my head.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />People probably think I'm the stereotypical nerd sitting at a computer, and I might be, but I'm at least not stuck in my parents' basement.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Lol. Is there anything else you nerd about apart from Pokemon?</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />I do love video games in general. Really, technology in general. I was one of those people that walked through Best Buy just to look at the new computers. Not the Apple ones though; those are the devil.</div>

  <div class="aside">It seems like we can't get out of the grocery aisle with these jokes. (Yes I know he meant computers you dumbs.)</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />There's also some of the traditional nerd shows like Doctor Who. I've never been able to watch old shows, though, so there's a lot of people who would deny me the title of TV nerd.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />So, shifting gears, what brought you to Smogon?</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />That's a bit of a long story. The short version is that I reeeaaally wanted a shiny Charizard. The less short version is that I learned RNG to get it. Decided that I wasn't happy with the performance I was getting out of the tools for it. So I made my own, was referred to Smogon (shoutout to Age of Kings, who was a Bulbagarden mod at the time) for an audience to check it out. I got pulled into RNG research just in time for 5th gen. And once you go on IRC, you never really leave.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />What was the tool you made for RNG?</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />Originally ZomgTimer. Cheesy? Yes. I thought it was hilarious at the time, though. I later made a better version called EonTimer, named for the Glaceon that decorates it.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />So how did you make the jump from making a timer to leading The Smog?</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />I got kinda bored a while back and started looking for things to do around here. Someone mentioned that The Smog might need some HTML help, so I did the whole evaluation thing and sent it off to Setsuna. 2 months later he replied and asked if I wanted to join the staff. I guess at the time it was rare to have someone with enough HTML and CSS skill to really build things.</div>

  <div class="aside">"Rare might be an understatement," I mutter to myself.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />What's kept you around Smogon? You're now not only leading The Smog but you've also become a member of Senior Staff.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />There's been plenty of times I've thought about leaving. I stick around for the friends I've made here and the occasional challenge that I find. I really like to help people, so I guess that's part of it too. I am just terrible at telling people no.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Lol. Alright, now for the question everyone's burning to know: why the name Toast(+1)?</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />Well, I've always been really bad at choosing usernames. On the off chance I found one that I liked, it was taken, of course. So I was signing up for.. something.. I'm not sure what, and just picked the first word that came to mind. "Toast" was taken, as you'd expect. It suggested adding numbers so I did it with words to make a name that I knew no one else would have. I was able to carry that across sites pretty easily. Later down the road, I had a chance to change my username to its current form. It seemed a little more appropriate to my personality.</div>

  <div class="aside">Still doesn't explain why toast precisely, but I imagine it has to do with him being crusty yet wholesome. And then the +1 being his wife.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />And now the question we ask everyone: what's your favorite Pokemon?</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />I've never been a "favorites" kind of guy since my answer changes almost daily. Articuno is a really old favorite, as is Lapras. I usually just go with Glaceon, though, since it's both an Eeveelution and an Ice-type.</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />What is it about Ice-types that you like so much?</div>

  <div class="interview-speaker toast"><img src="interview-toast.png" alt ="" />It seems to be a design thing. I like cooler colors and Ice just has a very refreshing feel to it. It's a real bummer that they're weak to pretty much everything. Seriously, Rock? Fighting? Steel? What the hell is that?</div>

  <div class="aside">And with that, I praise Jesus it's still summer. As I leave, Toast's wife hands me a stack of different flavored jellies and gives me a wink before saying goodbye and closing the door. Not totally sure what she meant by that, but the jelly was good.</div>
