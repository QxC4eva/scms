<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If a Pokemon uses <a href="/bw/moves/absorb">Absorb</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/drain_punch">Drain Punch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/dream_eater">Dream Eater</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/giga_drain">Giga Drain</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/leech_life">Leech Life</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/mega_drain">Mega Drain</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/horn_leech">Horn Leech</a> on the wielder, the attacker will lose HP equal to half of the damage dealt instead. The wielder will still lose 1/8th of its HP from <a href="/bw/moves/leech_seed">Leech Seed</a>, but the Pokemon that targeted the wielder will lose the same amount of HP rather than gaining it.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/tentacruel">Tentacruel</a> is the only competitive user of Liquid Ooze, and it prefers <a href="/bw/abilities/rain_dish">Rain Dish</a> usually, but you may occasionally find it on Tentacruel in order for it to better deal with <a href="/bw/pokemon/whimsicott">Whimsicott</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/ferrothorn">Ferrothorn</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/conkeldurr">Conkeldurr</a>. It also allows Tentacruel to counter threats such as <a href="/bw/moves/calm_mind">Calm Mind</a> <a href="/bw/pokemon/virizion">Virizion</a> much more easily. A decent ability, but generally outclassed by others.</p>
