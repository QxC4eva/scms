Overview
########
Will write this up in a bit
Faces a lot of competition from Tangela / Sprout / Oddish
Fastest Chlorophyll Sweeper in LC (Barring Tangela)
Has Poison STAB over Tangela
It is also Bulkier than Bellsprout
Its bulk makes it somewhat difficult to switch in
Has Growth over oddish


Life Orb Sun Sweeper
########
name: Life Orb Sun Sweeper
move 1: Sludge Bomb
move 2: Solar Beam / Giga Drain
move 3: Sleep Powder
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Life Orb
evs: 240 SpA / 240 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Sludge Bomb is the move that separates it from Tangela, and can OHKO +1 Swirlix 100% of the time
Solar Beam is Bulbasaur's most powerful STAB
Giga Drain can be used cause it is more reliable and doesn't rely on Sun
Sleep Powder allows Bulbasaur to cripple something that it can not OHKO
HP Fire is powered up in the sun and has really good coverage with the other moves

Set Details
========
The given EV spread Maximizes Bulbasaur's Speed and Special attack accounting for IV changes from HP fire
Timid Nature allows Bulbasaur to fulfill it's niche as the fastest chloro sweeper in LC
LO is used to give it more power, also guarantees the OHKO on +1 20/0 swirlix with Sludge bomb

Usage Tips
========
Bulbasaur is Fairly simple to use, set up sun and find a place to switch it in
It has decent special bulk so neutral or resisted Special attacks are your best bet
Once in the battle, use your strongest move if it is a OHKO or if you can survive one of their attacks
If something you can't take out switches in, cripple it with Sleep powder

Team Options
========
Vulpix is the Obvious choice for Bulba as it should be on dedicated sun teams
Pairs well with other Chloro sweepers as they can break walls allowing bulba to clean up late
Murkrow is a huge threat to Bulba, so things like Chinchou or Archen that can take on Murkrow are good options
Stuff that can provide a slower u turn or volt switch like Mienfoo, Vullaby and Chinchou
Eviolite Growth
########
name: Eviolite Growth
move 1: Growth
move 2: Sleep Powder
move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Eviolite
evs: 240 SpA / 240 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Growth is a great set up move for Bulbasaur, allowing it to hit 32 SpA after a boost in the sun
Sleep powder gives you more opportunities to set up and can let you whittle down hard to kill opponents
Giga Drain allows Bulbasaur to keep the sweep going outside of the sun and allows bulba to regain health
HP fire hits opposing grass types and steel types

Set Details
========
EV spread maximizes Speed and Special attack when taking into account the IVs from HP Fire
Timid Nature hits 15 speed, letting Bulbasaur outspeed or speed tie all scarfed threats in the sun
The timid nature also gives it the speed edge over opposing sun sweepers such as Bellsprout and speed ties modest Tangela
Eviolite give Bulbasaur more opportunities to switch in and set up Growth, and can allow the sweep to continue outside the sun

Usage Tips
========
This set is a lot easier to switch in due to Eviolite supported Bulk
Want to switch in on a neutral or resisted hit (in the sun)
Sleep powder something if you can't take two hits or use growth on set up bait or a forced switch
Once you have set up, attempt to punch as many hole in the opponents team as possible using sleep powder if you need and if the sleep clause hasn't been activated
This set is best used after an opponents fire type has been removed

Team Options
========
Vulpix is an obvious choice, but Heat Rock is nice, as it provides more set up / sweep time
This set has trouble with Fire Types such as Ponyta, Vulpix, and Growlithe so stuff that can take them on is appreciated (Gligar, Archen, Diglet)
Stealth Rock shorten's a fire-types life span (see the three above)
Archen is also nice for taking on Murkrow

Other Options
########
HP Ice is a decent option allowing you to take on Flying types and surprise Gligar
HP Rock is also an option to hit Fire types, but leaves you walled by steel types
A defensive set with Leech Seed, double powder, and a STAB But is easily walled by Grass or Steel types and are better defensive grass types
A Scarf set can be used out of the sun, but it lacks power and is inferior to many other scarfers

Checks & Counters
########
Vulpix is a really good Counter to Bulbasaur really only being annoyed by Sleep Powder
Other Fire Types such as Larvesta, Ponyta, and Growlithe are also good responses once something has been put to sleep
Specially defensive Vullaby with overcoat is an amazing counter
Rest Talk Munchlax doesn't really care about bulbasaur unless it has multiple growth boosts
Koffing can take any hit from Bulba after sleep powder has been used and OHKO with Fire Blast
