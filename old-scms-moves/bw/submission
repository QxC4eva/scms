[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage, and the user receives recoil damage equal to 1/4 of the damage dealt, rounded half up, but not less than 1 HP.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Submission saw some use back in the RBY days, when it was widely distributed and Fighting-type moves were all but nonexistent. Nowadays, however, hardly any Pokemon receive Submission and it is mostly outclassed by Brick Break, which trades just 5 Base Power for no recoil and perfect accuracy. Submission is simply not worth the moveslot.</p>
