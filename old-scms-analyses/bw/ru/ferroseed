[Overview]

<p>Besides the fact that it looks like a nasty durian fruit, Ferroseed is one of the most useful Pokemon in the RU tier. With a total of 10 resistances, an immunity to Poison-type attacks, and only two weaknesses, Ferroseed is a tough nut to crack. That's not all; thanks to its NFE status, Ferroseed can utilize Eviolite to bolster its defenses to unimaginable levels. Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Leech Seed are only three great moves in its arsenal; novelties such as Thunder Wave, Gravity, and Gyro Ball are also available, but offer less in terms of team support. Ferroseed's only sticking point is its relatively low HP stat and lack of reliable recovery outside of Leech Seed. Don't let that put you off, however, as Ferroseed is a prickly assailant that you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to Eviolite and its excellent typing, Ferroseed is a fantastic team supporter. With resistances to common Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks, Ferroseed can take on the likes of Slowking, Tangrowth, and Rotom with little trouble. Spikes and Stealth Rock provide valuable team support; Spikes are more useful as there are fewer Pokemon with Spikes in the tier. Thunder Wave helps cripple offensive switch-ins, such as Moltres and Sceptile, but Protect makes prediction easier and saps extra health with Leech Seed. Although Ferroseed only has a base 50 Attack stat, its horrible Speed lets Gyro Ball break Substitutes from Golurk and friends. Seed Bomb is an OK alternative as it's Ferroseed's only way of beating Crawdaunt, as well as dealing far more damage to Omastar and breaking the Substitutes of Feraligatr and other Water-types. Ferroseed is more or less a one trick-pony, but it does its job well.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Ferroseed's defensively oriented EV spread lets it take hits from physical mammoths such as Aerodactyl, Aggron, and Rhydon. A specially defensive spread can be used to take on Omastar, Rotom, and Galvantula without Hidden Power Fire, but leaves Ferroseed vulnerable to physical Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan. Toxic can be used over Thunder Wave to cripple bulkier opponents, such as Sandslash, Spiritomb, and Slowking.</p>

<p>Ferroseed appreciates a partner that can switch into Fire-type attacks; Alomomola and Slowking are probably the best teammates, as the former can provide valuable Wish support, while the latter has access to Slack Off and Regenerator to heal itself. Ferroseed will usually find itself being set up on; phazers, such as Mandibuzz can erase any stat boosts accumulated. Furthermore, Pokemon with Encore, Taunt, and the Unaware ability, such as Clefable, Aerodactyl, and Quagsire, respectively, will be problematic for opponents that attempt to set up against Ferroseed, making them excellent additions to your team. Ghost-types can switch into Fighting-type attacks and block Rapid Spin, as well as counter the likes of Hitmonchan and Gallade. Therefore, the likes of Golurk and Spiritomb make excellent assets to your team. Finally, Wish support from Alomomola and Clefable helps keep Ferroseed healthy and gives it a chance to fight another day.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ferroseed doesn't have much of a movepool outside of Spikes and Leech Seed; it's fairly limited in what it can do. Sunny Day can offer some additional team support, but the boost to Fire-type attacks is the last thing it wants to give to its opponents. Ferroseed can provide Gravity support for its teammates, but Ferroseed is better off using its other moves to support its team anyway. Rest can be used to heal Ferroseed, but it's recommended that you carry a cleric to wake it up. Seed Bomb is an alternative STAB move to hurt Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types, while Bullet Seed can be used to break frail Substitutes from the likes of Golurk.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Grass-types are immune to Leech Seed and the majority of them carry Hidden Power Fire; Sceptile can even destroy Ferroseed with Focus Blast. Fire- and Fighting-types, such as Moltres and Gallade, respectively, can take advantage of Ferroseed's low HP stat and either force it out or KO it. Magneton deserves an honorable mention as it can trap Ferroseed with Magnet Pull and set up with Substitute and Charge Beam. Taunt users can stop Ferroseed from setting up entry hazards and Leech Seed for a limited amount of time, while Rapid Spin users, especially Hitmonchan, Swords Dance Kabutops, and Swords Dance Sandslash, can remove its hazards and Leech Seed with ease. Both Magic Coat and Natu can bounce back Ferroseed's Spikes and Stealth Rock, while Tricking it a Choice item will remove its Eviolite and limit its capabilities. Rotom and Manectric are great Trick and Switcheroo users, respectively.</p>
