Counters foe's attack with 1.5x damage.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage to the last foe to hit the user with an attack this turn. The damage is equal to 1.5x the HP lost by the user from that attack. If that foe's position is no longer in use, damage is done to a random foe in range. Only the last hit of a multi-hit attack is counted. Fails if the user moves first or if the user was not hit by a foe's attack this turn.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Metal Burst is useful on slow, bulky Pokemon such as Aggron, which has the Sturdy ability. It can be used on both physical and special attacks, and has a good chance to OHKO the attacker. However, many times this move will result in a one-for-one sacrifice, a strategy that can bear no fruit.</p>
