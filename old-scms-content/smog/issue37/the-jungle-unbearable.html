<h3>Munchlax - "The Big Eater Pok&eacute;mon"</h3>
<p>Munchlax is a lonely bear, living in isolation and collecting food for the hibernation. For whatever reason, he can never keep a girl; maybe they don't like it when he eats their plates at the table? Well, really, Munchlax will eat anything and everything (which, by the way, makes picking out a restaurant a whole lot easier). Mainly, though, Munchlax loves to eat honey. Honey, honeycombs, honeybees; it's really all the same to this guy. While Munchlax might scare you right out of your socks, what with that terrifying look on his face, he's a very docile creature. Maybe he'd be a little bit more active if you know he wasn't eating all day long. With Munchlax's thick fat around his skin, he does appear to be a bit chubby. However, this is quite useful in the somewhat cold forest in which he lives. Right past the huge pinecone tree, to the left, down, about, and around, right there, that's where Munchlax lives. Sometimes he claims that his house is right next to a Trevenant, but silly him, Ghosts don't actually exist! During first grade, Munchlax picked up the name Gluttonous. Now, in third grade, this nickname is still not shaken. When Munchlax grows up, he hopes to become a food tester. He doesn't really need a job to do this anyway, but being paid to do so would be quite nice. During Munchlax's free time, he enjoys to listen to heavy metal because he feels it truly speaks to him. No one understands Munchlax the way heavy metal does. Mainly, Munchlax is a lovable, sweet guy that his friends enjoy having around!</p>

<h3>Teddiursa - "The Little Bear Pok&eacute;mon"</h3>
<p>Teddiursa is often portrayed as a lovable creature who's a tad insecure, sucking on his paw and all, but he has a bit of a darker side. Teddiursa believes he is "the chosen one," because of his moon birthmark on his forehead. As you can tell, he really has never met any other Teddiursa (hint: they all have moon birthmarks). This leads him to staring at the stars and moons every night, wondering what is out in the unknown. Because of this, he's devoted to living a lifestyle revolving around all things astronomical. For breakfast every morning, he eats the marshmallows resembling a moon from Lucky Charms, for lunch he snacks on crescent shaped peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and he finishes off his day with a dinner consisting of mooncakes. A bit of an odd diet, no? Well, that's just how Teddiursa rolls. Mooncakes are a bit tough to acquire in the state of Alabama, but Teddiursa has stockpiled for the winter and has a full unit of storage attached to his room's wall. Of the very few friends Teddiursa has, they usually choose to call him Pickup, as a reference to how he'll try to steal anything moon-related. When he grows older, Teddiursa has plans to fly to the moon; and by the time moon travel is possible, Teddiursa has plans to use a flying car to get there. Finally, his favorite band is Walk the Moon, which he finds to be quite relatable.</p>

<h3>Cubchoo - "The Chill Pok&eacute;mon"</h3>
<p>Cubchoo appears to be such a baby, never blowing her nose and always looking frightened, but oh no, she's much more than that. She's actually a strong and independent woman who does not need any male companionship. She is able to remain calm and level-headed throughout most situations and stands up for what she thinks is right. However, she's not exactly as normal. No one has ever really seen Cubchoo eat. Some say she doesn't ever eat anything besides her own boogers. No one is really sure what to make of it, she just does not eat. Cubchoo is often preyed on at school for this and the kids tease her, but she just blows at them. When she's not in school, Cubchoo enjoys residing in her bedroom of her and her father's apartment in the Arctic. She complains the house is too cold; it is -60 degrees after all! Because of this, Cubchoo has gained the nickname Snow, to mock her for being a polar bear and being cold, like snow. When she grows up, Cubchoo hopes to move to New York and begin a business of tissue lines. Her favorite artist is most likely the Arctic Monkeys, although she's not quite sure what a monkey really is, because she lives in the Arctic!</p>

<h3>Pancham - "The Playful Pok&eacute;mon"</h3>
<p>Pancham really is a joyful Pok&eacute;mon. She especially loves to hang out with her friends and snack on bamboo shoots! Bamboo is quite a favorite of hers; you usually will not see her without one, and should she not have one, she's most likely not in the mood to be talking to you. Her mischievous older brother once took Pancham's bamboo out of her mouth as she slept and coated it in hot sauce for her to wake up to the following morning. When Pancham woke up, she put the bamboo shoot in her mouth, and was she not in the mood for that. Her older brother had made a huge mistake, for Pancham had started thrashing about until her mother finally calmed her down. That's the reason she never trusts anyone with her bamboo shoot, especially her brother. Anyway, Pancham can be quite sassy at times and really has no filter whatsoever; this can lead to conflict at times. She will blurt out if your hair is ugly, although she also will let you know how pretty you look as well. Living in New York may appear glamorous, but to Pancham, it's a prison. She prefers living and roaming the wild, but that's just not the lifestyle she is able to have. Her usual nickname is Scraps, referencing the scraps of bamboo that she is oh so famous for! When she grows older, she intends to be a scientist to study bamboo and occasionally snack on her work when she's done. Finally, her favorite song is most definitely Questions; she most especially enjoys the artist, Bamboo, as well!</p>

<h3>Snorlax - "The Sleeping Pok&eacute;mon"</h3>

<p> Snorlax is a Pok&eacute;mon that lives in infamy, being most known for his blockage of Route 7 in Kalos. Because of this mishap, he was forced out of Kalos and now resides in plains of grass around China. He really doesn't mind, though, because it's very serene and calm and he quite enjoys it! Whatever's around, he'll most likely eat it, provided he's not sleeping! Many animals have attempted to hunt down Snorlax, yet none have ever succeeded. Such Pok&eacute;mon include Pyroar and their cubs, Litleo, but they've always failed because Snorlax's thick fat makes their onslaughts just little taps. Sometimes, Snorlax won't even wake up to tell them to go away! Snorlax's groans are quite scary, though; it may be part of the reason he does not have many friends. Really, though, Snorlax's most terrifying attribute is his morning breath, which is enough to clear anything within a two-mile radius. During school, Snorlax took a liking to the study of food. Because of this, Snorlax has gained the nickname Glutts, according to his gluttonous eating habits. Too bad for him though, he never really got a job, too busy sleeping to go to any interviews! When Snorlax is awake, he'll usually be listening to the song Froot, mainly because he is a huge fan of fruit.</p>

<h3>Ursaring - "The Hibernator Pok&eacute;mon"</h3>

<p> Ursaring looks angry at all times, but she's definitely a genuine and caring mother, though some say she may be a bit over protective. Due to her protectiveness, she's earned the nickname Quick Feet, referencing how quick she can run to her child's aid. She prefers not to use offense, though when her children are in danger her claws come out. She can be quite the furious attacker with a lot of guts, but she mainly prefers to just be protective. Battling is a bit unnerving to her, so she prefers to stay away from it if possible. Living in the forest can be a bit rough, but she manages with a house she has built. She's built a nice life for her family, making a cave to hibernate and store food. Growing up, Ursaring was always quite into construction and renovation, so she especially loved building this house! She's decorated her house to fit her personality: very colorful! Practically everything is colorful in her home, ranging from green couches to red microwaves; she likes to spice it up! If she had not been a renovator, she most likely would've become a lawyer to follow her father's wishes. However, she really wasn't about the whole lawyer thing. Her favorite songs include ones that are played with flutes, as she enjoys the fine structure of music and the simplicity and relaxation that comes from flutes.</p>

<h3>Beartic - "The Freezing Pok&eacute;mon"</h3>

<p> Beartic, ferocious and daunting, does not really have a side of him that is calm. He's quite the competitive Pok&eacute;mon, who also happens to be into professional swimming. This swimming obsession began as a young child when he discovered that swimming temporarily took away the snot he could never figure out how to stop from running. However, this is also how he has gained his icicle beard. Beartic was travelling for a swim meet and landed in Antarctica, which he did not mind at all; he actually enjoyed the cold. Walking through the town, he noticed there was a child swimming in the water. This worried him and he went over to check on it. Upon arrival, the child began sinking. Beartic dove directly in and tried to rescue it. He succeeded; however, his snot had formed into a frozen beard-like structure. For some reason, it never really entirely melted. Because of his love for swimming, Beartic has received the name Swift, after his agility in the water had proven how quick he can be. Anyway, Beartic quite enjoys snacking on crackers in his spare time and occasionally will delve into cooking himself! His favorite song is most definitely Sweater Weather, as it talks about the cold &amp; his absolute favorite!</p>

<h3> Pangoro - "The Daunting Pok&eacute;mon"</h3>
<p> All her life, Pangoro knew she wanted to become a professional wrestler, and although she didn't quite make it, she still lives a very happy life. Snacking on bamboo shoots every day, she's made a life out on the farm. Out on the farm, she bonds with Miltank and Tauros that roam about. However, little do they know, Pangoro is also quite the carnivore. She loves a good steak every now and then! She'd never intentionally harm any of them, though. Anyway, growing up, she was always a bit advanced for her age. She was solving multiplication problems in kindergarten, long division in second grade, and so on; she usually had no friends due to this. She did have slight anger issues, although those are long-gone now. However, because she did have anger fits, people called her The Breaker. Living in Alabama has also earned her the name Moldy, a reference to how Alabama farmers are old and weird. She loves living her simple life, and does not let anyone else's words bring her down. She really likes country music, her favorite song being Sunshine and Whisky.</p>
