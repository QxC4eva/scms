<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage, if the target is asleep. The user recovers half of the HP lost by the target, rounded up. If Big Root is held by the user, the HP recovered is 1.3x normal, rounded half down. Fails if the target is not under the sleep status. This move is not affected by Liquid Ooze.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There isn't much competitive value for this move, as it requires two very specific situations in order to work. Firstly, the target needs to already be asleep, and secondly, it can't be a Dark-type. As soon as you put a Pokemon to sleep (an already difficult task considering the low accuracy of most sleep inducing moves available) your opponent can simply switch out to make Dream Eater useless, and thanks to Sleep Clause, you can't put another one to sleep, making Dream Eater useless. Sleep is such a powerful status condition that most of the time it's better to use the guaranteed one sleep turn to get a frail sweeper onto the field for free or to use a set-up move of your own.</p>
