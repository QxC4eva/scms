[Overview]

<p>Wormadam-G is a mixed bag of a Pokemon. On one hand, it resists Ground- and Fighting-type moves, but on the other, it's weak to common Water- and Ice-type attacks. Its movepool is relatively shallow, it lacks Stealth Rock, and it has no way to recover outside of Rest. Wormadam-G's only saving graces are its decent defenses and access to Rain Dance and Sunny Day. Anticipation isn't a bad ability by any means, and it helps Wormadam-G scout dangerous moves. Outside of that, Wormadam-G is nothing special and is considered a joke, but it's a fun change of pace.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Very little has changed for Wormadam-G from DPPâ€”it's still a horrible gimmick. The idea is to switch into a weak physical attacker, set up with Rain Dance or Sunny Day, then get the hell out. Earthquake is a reliable STAB move, Bug Bite deals damage to Grass- and Psychic-types, and Toxic gives Wormadam-G a way to cripple opposing walls. Sunny Day somewhat alleviates Wormadam-G's Water-type weakness, but Rain Dance teams are more threatening off the bat. Wormadam-G should never be your primary weather Pokemon, but it makes for an excellent backup.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread takes advantage of Wormadam-G's decent HP and Defense, while the remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense for an extra point. A specially defensive spread can be used to combat threats such as Haunter, though it's largely inferior to a physically defensive spread. Pokemon that can take advantage of the weather are obvious teammates. Gorebyss, Seismitoad, Swanna, and Ludicolo are all amazing rain abusers with Swift Swim, and Electric-types can abuse 100% accurate Thunder. Leafeon and Exeggutor can abuse Chlorophyll in sunny weather, while Fire-types, such as Charizard, can fire off boosted STAB moves. Bulky Water-types give Wormadam-G problems, making a Grass-type, such as Tangela, a great teammate.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>To keep things short, Wormadam-G's movepool is nothing short of terrible. Sucker Punch can be used to catch a faster Pokemon off guard, Rest and Sleep Talk can be used to keep Wormadam-G alive longer, and Rock Blast can be used to break the opponent's Substitute. Return can be used as an alternative to Bug Bite, but it doesn't receive a STAB boost nor does it provide any significant type coverage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything with a Fire-, Water-, Ice-, or Flying-type move can deal massive damage to Wormadam-G. Weezing is immune to Earthquake and takes little damage from Bug Bite, while Leafeon takes a pittance from Earthquake and restores Bug Bite damage with Wish. Anything that resists Earthquake and takes little from Bug Bite can be called a counter. Articuno is an uncommon sight in NU but makes for a remarkable Wormadam-G counter; with an immunity to Earthquake, a resistance to Bug Bite, and Heal Bell to cure status, Wormadam-G has no way to break Articuno's frozen wings. Anything with Substitute and a moderate Defense stat can render it useless; Samurott, Rotom-S, and Serperior are good examples. Wormadam-G is so easy to counter it's ridiculous, and a specialized counter is unnecessary.</p>
