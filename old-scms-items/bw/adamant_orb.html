Hold item which raises power of Dialga's STAB moves 4915/4096.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by Dialga, the Adamant Orb multiplies the power of all damage-dealing Dragon- and Steel-type moves used by the holder by 4915/4096 (approximately 1.2). Can be held by other Pokemon, but then has no effect.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Since Adamant Orb only has an effect when held by Dialga, naturally the only time you would want to use it would be with a Dialga, but even then it is essentially useless in competitive play as Life Orb is just better for pretty much anything Dialga can do, providing a 30% boost to all of Dialga's moves, as opposed to 4915/4096 just to Dragon- and Steel-type moves. It can potentially be useful for bluffing a Choice item, but Expert Belt is normally a better choice for that strategy, as it is not limited to Dialga's STAB attacks.</p>
