<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Earth Power is a decent move for specially attacking Pokemon, as it is relatively powerful and has no drawbacks. It provides great additional coverage for Pokemon such as Heatran, or STAB for Pokemon such as Nidoking. However, many of the Pokemon with Earth Power have low Special Attack, such as Claydol, Gliscor, Tyranitar, Mamoswine, and more, or have better coverage options to use, such as Celebi and Shaymin. In addition, many of the Ground-types that receive this move prefer Earthquake, which is backed by a higher Attack stat. Therefore, only a few Pokemon are commonly seen with Earth Power. In any case, Pokemon with Air Balloon intact avoid this move, so be sure to use it with care.</p>
