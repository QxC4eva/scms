<h3>Who is aragornbird?</h3>
<p>Long regarded as Smogon's resident artist, aragornbird's artwork was—for many, many years—a vibrant welcome to anyone visiting Smogon's main page. In fact, the logo Smogon currently uses is of aragornbird's design.</p>

<p>In many ways, aragornbird was the father of Smeargle's Studio, being the original (and sole) moderator as a near-constant presence. While he no longer moderates, aragornbird is still a regular contributor to the forum, and is a feared MAC entrant.</p>

<p>aragornbird's style is undoubtedly the peak of professionalism, and it seems almost unfair to attempt to describe it in a few sentences. Vibrant colours and clean line art are the bread-and-butter of aragornbird's pieces, but it is the intense detail that makes his artwork memorable: he often works at large sizes to add extra highlights and shades. For this reason, his work is comparable to a tapestry, which can be looked at for hours on end.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>Won MACs and stuff.</p>
