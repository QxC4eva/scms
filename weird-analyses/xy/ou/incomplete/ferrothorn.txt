Moves
##########

-Leech Seed provides Ferrothorn the recovery it needs to survive.
-Thunder Wave is there to cripple fast threats such as Talonflame and Greninja while Gyro Ball allows you to hit faster Pokemon hard.
-Power Whip allows you to hit Ground, Water, and Rock types hard while Protect allows you to get Leech Seed recovery while scouting the opponent.
-Do not run Gyro Ball and Thunder Wave on the same set.

Set Details
########
-Leftovers helps Ferrothorn heal when it can not use Leech Seed while Rocky Helmet effectively takes 25% of a Physical Attack when it is hit with a Direct Contact move.
-The EV spreads are there to allow Ferrothorn to perform as a mixed wall. If you already have a Special or Physical Wall, you can put EVs in Defense or Special Defense to make Ferrothorn a stronger wall of the wall you do not have.
-Relaxed nature and the 0 Speed IVs allows Gyro Ball to take maximum damage.

Usage Tips
###########
-Switch in Ferrothorn to a Pokemon that Ferrothorn resists.
-Once Ferrothorn is in, set up Spikes or Stealth Rocks if needed, or Thunder Wave the upcoming counter or Leech Seed if it already has a status.
-Ferrothorn hates burns, but does not care too much about paralysis as Gyro Ball gets stronger.

Team Options
#########
-Many setup sweepers enjoy the hazards that Ferrothorn provide.
-Water-types such as Rotom-W and Azumarill works very well together as Water-types in general help resist many types together.
-Pokemon that resist both Fire and Fighting are great partners to Ferrothorn such as Azumarill, Dragonite, and Salamence.

Other Options
#########
-A Choice Band Ferrothorn can throw off certain Pokemon and do a lot of damage, but the only real damage Ferrothorn will do is to hurt Fire-types with Bulldoze.
-Ferrothorn can also run Toxic to poison other Pokemon that like to setup on Ferrothorn, but most Pokemon switch out by the time they get Thunder Wave or Leech Seeded.

Checks and Counters
##########
-Many Fire-type Pokemon can end Ferrothorn quite easily such as Talonflame, Charizard X, Charizard Y, and Victini. However, to Physical attackers, none of them would like to lose 25% of their health by the Iron Barb and Rocky Helmet combo.
-Any Pokemon with a strong Attack or Special Attack stat with a fire move can often make Ferrothorn switch or KO on the spot.
-Pokemon with strong Fighting-type STAB such as Lucario and Conkeldurr can force Ferrothorn out.
-Taunt users such as Sableye, Thundurus, and Gliscor often shut down Ferrothorn while only Thundurus fears Gyro Ball.
-Burning Ferrothorn can cripple it in some ways.
