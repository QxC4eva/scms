<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I've been using this team for the past month and a half now and it has consistently been good, peaking at 1st with 1421 points or higher, since I took the screenshot right after a loss, as well as keeping three other alts in the top 10 for a extended period of time. I wanted to use a sweeper that was strong but could also take opponents by surprise; after testing out some Pokemon, I found that Marowak was perfect. It had enough speed to outrun walls and could hit extremely hard. It could deal a lot of damage to the balanced teams that were popular during that time. </p>

<p>The team utilizes a strong offensive core of Marowak and Magmortar to apply offensive pressure and eliminate each other's counters. Other members help check big threats roaming around since Magmortar and Marowak lack defensive synergy while also packing a punch. Hopefully, after counters and threats have been eliminated from the opponent's team, Rotom-F or someone else can clean up. Although by no means frail, this team is not meant to take hits and is played extremely aggressively. </p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/348.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Armaldo</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Battle Armor<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- X-Scissor<br />
- Rock Blast</p>

<p>Armaldo is listed first and is arguably the most important Pokemon on the team. I don't usually lead with it because it loses to things like Golem and Regirock. Armaldo provides Stealth Rocks which helps Marowak and Magmortar grab crucial KOs and limits the amount of times threats such as Jynx and Swellow can switch in. It also spins away rocks, allowing Magmortar to come in on Tangela or other walls with less pressure and making Rotom-F's job as a scout much easier. How I execute with Armaldo early on in the match often determines the outcome of the match. </p>

<p>Once it has done it's job, I like to save Armaldo later as a death fodder or to tank heavy attacks since the rest of the team with the exception of Vileplume have a hard time taking hits. Armaldo's bulk has impressed me a number of times, surviving attacks such as Magmortar's Fire Blast at full health, although its lack of resistances really hurts its ability to tank hits. With 383 attack, it also packs plenty of firepower, ensuring it will not be set-up fodder and dealing hefty blows to switch ins with X-Scissor and Rock Blast. I'm considering Earthquake over X-Scissor in order to hit steel and rock types harder, but it's rather situational and I don't want to give up the ability to do lots of damage on grass and psychic types; plus, the next team member handles them quite wellâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>Marowak</strong> @ Thick Club<br />
Ability: Rock Head<br />
EVs: 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Bonemerang<br />
- Fire Punch<br />
- Double-Edge</p>

<p>When I was first thinking of 'Mons to build a team around, I passed over Marowak because of its lack of recovery and slow speed. However after facing one on the ladder and witnessing its power and surprising bulk, I decided to try it out and never looked back. Marowak's main task is to weaken opposing walls so that the other team members have an easier time cleaning up. The number of Pokemon that can handle Marowak's attacks is ridiculously small and they all provide other team members with easy switch-ins. </p>

<p>One of the best points about Marowak is that it prevents most Sturdy Pokemon from setting up Rocks. Max speed Golem will outspeed, but if it decides to stay in it will be dead and Armaldo can spin the Rocks away later. I would use max speed myself for the speed tie, but I feel the HP EVs are crucial for helping Marowak take some hits, since it is so slow. There really isn't much to say about Marowak other than it wrecks stuff every time it comes in.</p>

<p><strong>Magmortar</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Vital Spirit<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>I'm actually hoping Magmortar would move to NU so I can start making other teams without worrying about it running me over. Magmortar is the most powerful attacker on this team, even stronger than Marowak. It's easy to come in on a sleep move, Will-o-Wisp, or resisted attack and start plowing through the other team. Armaldo and Marowak are so efficient at keeping hazards off the field that even if the opponent sends in a counter, I can simply switch out and have another whack at them later. </p>

<p>This set is so standard and simple, yet so many teams have trouble dealing with Magmortar. I simply click Fire Blast whenever I switch in and then hit the switch-in with the appropriate coverage move. Misses are annoying, but thats the price you have to pay for such firepower. Magmortar is easily the MVP of the team, netting at least 1 or 2 kills every match.</p>

<p><strong.Vileplume</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Chlorophyll<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Sludge Bomb<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Moonlight<br />
- Aromatherapy</p>

<p>Vileplume plays a crucial role as the bulkiest member of the team. The rest of the team has trouble with fighting types, and Vileplume handles them extremely well. On top of that, it serves as the only water resist on the team and prevents SD Samurott and Seismitoad from running over the team. Vileplume also helps clear any status induced to the team, which is a godsend since this team HATES paralysis, burns, and such. The lack of Sleep Powder does not matter since common switch-ins to Vileplume like Magmortar and Swellow aren't even affected by sleep.</p>

<p>Vileplume has trouble with poison and bug types; it is easily set up on by Garbodor or Volbeat. It's bulk on the special side is also underwhelming; it is severly damaged by most Ice Beams and Psychics. Vileplume is probably the weakest link on the team, but at the same time, it plays an important role in securing crucial resistances that the team does not have, spreading status, and as a cleric.</p>

<p><strong>Skuntank</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Aftermath<br />
EVs: 72 HP / 252 Atk / 184 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Poison Jab<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Sucker Punch</p>

<p>In my opinion Skuntank is the best Pokemon in NU right now. It can check five of the top six Pokemon in the Feburary usage stats and is never dead weight. Skuntank serves as an emergency stop in so many situations and has saved my ass countless times. Without it, dangerous 'Mons like Absol, Magmortar, and Haunter would run right over my team. It also traps pesky psychic types, especially Grumpig, one of the few counters to Magmortar. Along with Vileplume, Skuntank absorbs Toxic Spikes, which can reduce the lifespan of my two wallbreakers.</p>

<p>Skuntank also does a good job of cleaning up late-game along with Rotom-F after the opposing team is weakened. Priority is a must-have in the fast paced NU metagame and Skuntank's Sucker Punch is one of the strongest. 184 speed EVs are used to outpace Adamant Absol. It also allows Skuntank to be a bit faster than defensive Cryogonal, so Skuntank can Pursuit and get an easy kill. More bulk would be nice, but as I stated before, Skuntank needs to be able to check Absol and kill it or else it could potentially sweep me.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/501.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Rotom-F</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Volt Switch<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>Last but not least, Rotom-F is the main revenge-killer and catch-all of the team. Just like Skuntank, it helps prevent a large amount of threats from sweeping the team. Rotom-F has some significant advantages over Rotom-S, namely resistances to electric and ice, the ability to beat Rotom-S itself one on one, and the fact that it looks much cooler (no pun intended). </p>

<p>The moveset is odd, as it has two ice type attacks and two electric type attacks. I used to have Trick in place of Hidden Power, but Blizzard misses against 1 HP Golems and such were hilarious, and I had never really used Trick anyways. Reliable, unresisted coverage is always nice, and allows Rotom-F to clean up nicely late-game.</p>
