Lowers user's Defense and Special Defense by 1 stage.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Lowers the user's Defense by one stage 100% of the time, and lowers Special Defense by one stage if and only if Defense is attempted to be lowered by the effect of this move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Close Combat is possibly the most lauded Fighting-type move in the game, and undoubtedly one of the best offensive moves out there, since it has a very high 120 Base Power, a fairly inconsequential side effect, and provides the amazing Fighting-type coverage. It does lower both of the user's defensive stats by one stage, but most users of it are frail anyway, as well as fast.</p>
