<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Snatch enables the user to steal the target's move and use its effect on itself, instead of the intended recipient. A move cannot be stolen multiple times. This move has a priority of +4, so will always go before any move that can be Snatched. The moves that can be taken by Snatch include: all stat-boosting moves (eg. Swords Dance), all recovery moves (eg. Recover, Ingrain, Recycle), all effect-changing moves (eg. Magnet Rise, Power Trick, Reflect), and certain protection moves. Substitute, Lucky Chant, Wide Guard, and Fast Guard can all be Snatched, but Protect and Detect cannot. Acupressure cannot be Snatched. Imprison can be Snatched, but Taunt and other such moves cannot. Aromatherapy, Heal Bell, Healing Wish, and Lunar Dance can all be Snatched. Helping Hand cannot be Snatched. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute.</p>

<p>In double or triple battles, Snatch affects all opposing Pokemon, so Snatch can theoretically steal more than one boost from different Pokemon. If two Pokemon on opposing sides use Snatch, then the faster Pokemon will Snatch any boosts on the slower Pokemon's side, and then the slower Pokemon will Snatch those boosts from the faster Pokemon, so that only the slower Pokemon enjoys the effects of the original move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Although a gimmicky strategy, Snatch can be used due to the array of beneficial effects it has if the user predicts well. For example, many Pokemon that learn Snatch are very weak defensively and thus the opponent may bring in a Dragon-type in to set up Dragon Dance on them. If the user predicts this and uses Snatch, it could be a game-changing surprise. It may also see use rarely on something such as Reuniclus, who is often not able to break through Pokemon such as Blissey. With Snatch, it can take the effects of Softboiled as Blissey uses it.</p>
