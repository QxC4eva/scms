<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Burns the target. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Will-O-Wisp is a great move for any support Pokemon that has it. It also has a wide distribution and it's not hard to fit a Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp. Will-O-Wisp easily cripples physical attackers bar Fire-types and Guts users or those already statused such as Toxic Orb Breloom. Will-O-Wisp also helps some physically frail users, such as Gallade, sponge physical attacks from burned opponents. As a majority of the Fighting-types are physically oriented, Ghost-types can often switch in easily and burn them with Will-O-Wisp. Will-O-Wisp is useful on any team as burns can quickly disable physical threats while also wearing down burned opponents.</p>
