########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Kings Shield
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Gyro Ball / Iron Head
move 4: Shadow Ball / Shadow Sneak
ability: Stance Change
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD
nature: Sassy

Moves
========

- Kings Shield allows Aegislash to scout for random coverage moves like HP Fire Xern, while allowing it to get more Leftovers recovery, and most importantly, change back to shield form.
- Toxic cripples walls like support Arceus and tanks like Ho-Oh (especially Sub, if you hit it on the switch) and synergizes great with potential Kings Shield stalling
- Gyro Ball easily OHKOs a boosted GeoXern and can do chip damage to any faster Pokemon switching in, like Darkrai
- Iron Head is much more reliable but can never OHKO Xerneas even after SR
- Shadow Ball hits some frailer Pokemon hard, but is too weak uninvested to do any major damage to bulkier Pokemon, failing even to take out a Substitute from Ho-Oh
- Shadow Sneak can be used over Shadow Ball to revenge kill a weakened sweeper like a MMY or CM Arceus-Ghost, but again, will not do any major damage

Set Details
========

- Stance Change gives a well played Aegislash great bulk and power, but defensive Aegislash should not be taking unecesary hits in either form due to lack of recovery
- Leftovers synergizes well with Kings Shield and is Aegislashs only form of recovery
- EVs give max bulk etc
- Sassy should be used even when using Iron Head to reduce the chance of being hit in Blade form

Usage Tips
========

- Aegislash is not going to wall everything and should not be the only defensive Pokemon on your team, do not keep it in against something like Kyogre because you just will never win
- If you can look at the opponents team and see Aegislash is useless then feel free to let it die, but using Kings Shield the turn before dying can give a teammate a chance to set up
- Your STABs have intended targets and are rarely useful otherwise. Outside of Pokemon like Gengar or Xerneas, they will be doing only chip damage mostly. Feel free to Toxic anything as long as you're in shield form.

Team Options
========

- Defensive Ho-Oh resists Fire and is immune to Ground, and has good spdef to take hits from Yveltal
- Groudon/Landorus-T (watch out for random fire attacks like HP Fire Xern if using Groudon)
- Certain Yveltal beats Mold Breaker Excadrill, Arceus-Ghost, Blaziken, and Gliscor for it
- Defensive Arceus-Rock beats Ho-Oh but it's risky vs Yveltal that have Focus Blast

Other Options
########

- Offensive set
- Flash Cannon > Gyro/Iron Head but you lose to Xerneas.
- Sacred Sword for coverage but it's weak uninvested
- Physically defensive
- Head Smash is a nice surprise for Yveltal switching in
- Pursuit
- Not much else pretty bad movepool
