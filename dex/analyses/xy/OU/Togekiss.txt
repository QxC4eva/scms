Overview
########
- Togekiss gained a massive buff this generation in Fairy typing.
- Has turned into an excellent special wall, handling Latios and Landorus with ease in addition to various Fighting-types with a 4x Fighting resistance, and taking most neutral special hits with remarkable ease.
- Access to reliable recovery in Roost as well as the ability to severely annoy foes with Serene Grace-enhanced paraflinch (STAB Air Slash + Thunder Wave).
- Also can form a solid defensive attacker with Nasty Plot, or fill a solid offensive role -- it gets all the coverage it could ever want in two solid STAB, Flamethrower, and Aura Sphere.
- Weak to Stealth Rock.
- Weak to now common Poison- and Steel-type attacks, as well as Rock, Electric, and Ice (though it can take things like non-STAB Ice Beams and Thunderbolts with relative ease).

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Roost
move 2: Air Slash
move 3: Thunder Wave / Nasty Plot
move 4: Dazzling Gleam / Defog / Aura Sphere
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========
- Roost provides reliable recovery.
- Air Slash is a decent-powered STAB with a 60% flinch chance due to Serene Grace.
- Thunder Wave to cripple speedy offensive Pokemon and allow for paraflinch shenanigans with Air Slash, which combined leave a low chance for the opponent to even make a move whilst they are brought to death.
- Or, Nasty Plot to allow for some offensive presence in Togekiss. Due to its bulk it gets many setup opportunities, and it's actually a pretty good sweeper.
- Last slot is kind of a toss-up between a few options.
- Dazzling Gleam gives you a Fairy STAB with which to hit Dragon-types.
- Defog gets rid of hazards, naturally, allowing Togekiss to support in that fashion.
- Aura Sphere hits Tyranitar really hard and OHKOes Bisharp whilst giving you super effective coverage on Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Heatran, which could otherwise wall Togekiss.

Set Details
========
- EVs allow Togekiss to take special hits as well as possible.

Usage Tips
========
- Send it out on things like Dragon- and Fighting-types, as well as pretty much anything that hits specially and can't hit you with a STAB super effective attack.
- Roost as needed -- you'll generally want to before you switch out unless Togekiss hasn't lost much HP.
- You'll want to paralyze foes assuming you have Thunder Wave (assuming they're not a Ground-type) and then you can just annoy the hell out of them with the low chance to move between Air Slash and Thunder Wave whilst getting rid of them.
- With Nasty Plot, set it up when you're in a position to actually do some damage/need the power boost to take out the opposing Pokemon.
- Pretty much just use the last slot moves against the relevant targets, there's not really much beyond that.
- You want to get rid of SR before you bring Togekiss in -- it's a real detriment to it defensively. Try and get it in, Defog away the hazards, and Roost back up ASAP if you have to run Defog.

Team Options
========
- Pokemon to cover things like Terrakion, Mega Lucario, Tyranitar (if you lack Aura Sphere), Kyurem-B, Thundurus, and other powerful offensive threats that can hit super effectively are 100% necessary.
- Landorus-T makes a good partner, handling physical Mega Lucario and Tyranitar nicely.
- Sylveon fares well against Kyurem-B and Thundurus, and can get rid of troublesome Toxic status with Heal Bell.
- If you're not running Defog, a Defog user is almost a necessity. Latias handles Thundurus marvelously and serves as a good check to Terrakion and way to threaten Kyurem-B. Zapdos can handle Mega Lucario, a huge threat to Togekiss, very well and Defog.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Air Slash
move 3: Dazzling Gleam
move 4: Flamethrower / Aura Sphere / Roost
ability: Serene Grace
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
- Nasty Plot boosts Togekiss's SpA to threatening levels.
- Air Slash is the main STAB, boasting decent power and a 60% chance to flinch, which allows it to hax its way past foes in many scenarios -- though this should never be relied upon.
- Dazzling Gleam is the other STAB, providing coverage on Dark-types, especially Mandibuzz, and Dragon-types such as Latias and Latios.
- Flamethrower is generally preferred in the last slot as the only way to hit Aegislash whilst felling Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and other Steel-types.
- Alternatively, Aura Sphere if you really hate Tyranitar.
- Or, Roost if you want to keep Togekiss healthy and have ways to handle threats that would be taken care of by the coverage move of choice.

Set Details
========
- Simple offensive EV spread maximizes Togekiss's sweeping potential.
- A Life Orb is pretty important to hit as hard as possible.
- However Leftovers can also be run if survivability is your cup of tea.

Usage Tips
========
- Bring this in later in the game when its counters have been removed.
- It has lots of resistances and two immunities, so switching in isn't all that hard.
- Set up immediately upon switching in and proceed to attack as appropriate, or set up against if you have a really good opportunity.
- With a Life Orb, you'll want to keep Stealth Rock off the field so as to preserve Togekiss's health, which prevents revenge killers and priority users that can't hit it particularly hard from prematurely ending its sweep.

Team Options
========
- Defog user. Latias and Zapdos make good choices, as well as Latios, which is a good option on the slightly more offensive teams you'll want to run this Togekiss on.
- Ways to eliminate the blobs, Steel-types, Mega Venusaur, etc. Think a Pokemon like Mega Charizard-X.
- Sticky Web from Smeargle or Galvantula to let Nasty Plot Togekiss outrun more stuff and thus have a much easier time sweeping. Alternatively you can have something like TWave Deoxys-D, and then just run Excadrill > Defogger with the hazards Deoxys-D provides, and you'll be all set.

Other Options
########
- Physically defensive
- Bulky attacker
- Nasty Plot + Baton Pass

Checks and Counters
########

- **Steel- and Poison-types**: Most notably, Scizor, Bisharp, and Mega Venusaur.

- **Specially bulky walls**: Blissey, Chansey, Clefable, and Umbreon, though the latter two have to watch being flinched to death, as boosted Air Slashes from offensive variants do a solid amount.

- **Status**: Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, they cripple Togekiss by limiting its survivability and forcing it to Roost more often, generating free turns that you can capitalize on. Think Rotom-W, Blissey, Chansey. Paralysis hurts, too.

- **Electric-, Ice-, and Rock-types**: Rotom-W, Thundurus, Zapdos, Rotom-H, Kyurem-B, Greninja (Protean gives it STAB Ice Beam), Terrakion.

- **Stealth Rock**: Limits its longevity significantly.

- **Powerful physical attackers**: Overwhelm Togekiss. Think Choice Band Talonflame as a prime example.
