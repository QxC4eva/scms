Cures paralysis. One-time use.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If held by a Pokemon, will automatically cure the paralysis status condition when inflicted on the holder. Consumed after use. Can also be used forcibly by the trainer in-game. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Fire-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Cheri Berry isn't that great an item. Paralysis is a nasty status and can grind a sweeper to a halt with ease, but if your Pokemon happens to be poisoned or burned, then this item goes to waste. Typically Lum Berry is favored as it enables the Pokemon to recover from any status once, not just paralysis, which is more beneficial to those susceptible to it.</p>
