[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 100% chance to lower the target's Speed by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Bulldoze is generally too weak to be considered for competitive use, with Earthquake, a well-distributed move, providing a much more powerful alternative. However, there is the odd Pokemon which does not learn Earthquake and struggles against Pokemon with a 4x Ground-type weakness, for example Ferrothorn, which can use the move to hit Heatran and Magnezone.</p>
