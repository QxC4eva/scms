<p>Hey everybody! I've been absent for quite a while but my heart is still here with Smogon and with Pok√©mon!</p>

<p>Kevo and I showed up about noon at the regionals. We met up with Royboy, TeeJay, Biffster, OmegaDonut and a few others. There were so many peeps there it was mindbottling!</p>

<p>The line was tremendous. When I got inside and into the roped lines I was number 302. Ended up there were 637 entrants in the seniors division. My first round was quick and decisive. The second round I faced this cute chick. She had skills but I won 2-0. The rest of the rounds were all down to the wire up until the 8th were I finished 4th out of 637. Highlights: putting out the fellas who put out Kevin and OmegaDonut. Raping my way through such a large field. Doing it w/o Quick Claw Kyogre!</p>
