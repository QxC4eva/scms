<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The move's type changes depending on the held Drive item. If the user holds a Burn Drive, the move will be Fire-type. If the user holds a Chill Drive, the move will be Ice-type. If the user holds a Douse Drive, the move will be Water-type. If the user holds a Shock Drive, the move will be Electric-type. If the user does not hold a Drive, the move will be Normal-type.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Techno Blast is Genesect's signature move, and it will rarely, if ever, utilize this move. The reasons are twofold; first of all, it is ironically weaker than Flamethrower, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt, not to mention that Normal-type Techno Blast has awful coverage. Only Water-type Techno Blast could possibly see any competitive use and it is only notable for hitting Fire-types. Water-type Hidden Power boosted by Life Orb is more powerful than Water-type Techno Blast. To make matters even worse, Techno Blast forces Genesect to forgo a more useful item such as a Life Orb or Choice Scarf. So don't bother using Techno Blast, it just isn't worth it.</p>
