<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/59.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Arcanine</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- Morning Sun<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Extremespeed</p>

<p>this thing is just as good as last gen ... i like it because this team doesn't really like ghosts (if i can't spin then ugh..) but arcanine beats every single one of them except that ground/ghost that no one uses. one of the best things about arcanine is extremespeed - a stall team doesnt really have counters lategame to fast sweepers which is something i dislike about them - so adding a strong exspeeder and a scarf mon (you'll see later) was really helpful. a lot of times, opponents will set up for one mon realizing they need to go all or nothing and then arcanine and my scarfer just finish them off. i would say azelf is the most common one.</p>

<p>double intimidate with top is really good, and if you want to wall things in b/w, you can't settle on just using your defenses ... we needed to be able to lower the atk of everything as well. i will also say that nine is essential in absorbing will o wisp of other pokemon ... wisp taunt missy, wisp mew, etc can really fuck me up if i dont have arcanine</p>

<p><strong>Chansey</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Heal Bell<br />
- Softboiled<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>probably the best pokemon in uu, i don't get why its not used on every team - it can sr, status, wish, or even heal bell, and is really more of an attacker - she is so good at walling that usually she can just kill most pokemon like flygon straight up without having to switch.</p>

<p>august suggested heal bell here, as i originally had wish - this was a huge change for the better because more often than not, i was getting beat by other stall teams because my only spinner was getting worn down - chansey prevents that because now my spinner can rest and chansey can heal bell.</p>

<p>stealth rock doesn't have anywhere else to go, but i love it on chansey - i can double switch into stuff like jolt, cune, milo, etc all the time and get my free sr.</p>

<p><strong>Ferroseed</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Iron Barbs<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 64 Def / 192 SpD<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Leech Seed<br />
- Protect<br />
- Gyro Ball</p>

<p>the second eviiolite user - drastically underrated. people really like roserade as the spiker to stall teams, but she is much frailer, weak to ice beam (meaning she cant really do as much against hail or ice beam sweepers like cune), and is lacking the best defensive type in the game in steel.</p>

<p>holy fuck iron barbs is so good - it provides offense while we play defense and sr/spikes/iron barbs quickly stacks up.</p>

<p>gyro ball is a bitch for people to play, it usually throws people off when they see how strong it hits (ferros weak but gyro ball is like max power) and it prevents non hp fire rose from spiking on me.</p>

<p>i originally had toxic over protect until august reminded me how dumb that is - now i can scout things like scarf victini (will they uturn or vcreate?) and stuff like azelf to see if i can spike or if they will fthrower.</p>

<p><strong>Hitmontop</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Foresight<br />
- Rest<br />
- Close Combat</p>

<p>secondary rock wall next to cune, i usually need to save top for spinning, but if i dont see any spikes user i will be much more lenient with letting him wall early. </p>

<p>top's close combat is strong as hell (180 bp!) and people seem to forget that when they switch random things in. it can ohko a ton of things when i have sr and spikes up, and more often than not against a slower team, top can end up ccing everything for game (lots of teams are like empoleon/chansey/rhyperior/mew or deoxys-d/flying-type/ghost - usually this is an easy 3 man job of arcanine/top/cune to beat these teams, top just tossing around close combats until stuff eventually dies to sr or repeated switching)</p>

<p>if canine and ferro are both weakened down, foresight + chansey is a last ditch effort for mismagius... don't let your mons get weakened</p>

<p>if you use this team, and they have spikes up and sr up - don't be dumb, just foresight the first time if they have a ghost. the next times spikes/sr get set up its a lot more annoying but hopefully it doesn't come to thatâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>Suicune</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 248 Def / 8 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Scald<br />
- Roar<br />
- Reflect<br />
- Rest</p>

<p>holy crap this thing is good - not only is it almost impossible to kill, it completely walls things like azumarill being able to reflect first and then i can even scald for a chance of burn. am i overloading on defense? hell yeah, because cune can beat almost any physical attacker in the game 1 on 1, and if something gets too strong like curselax, i can roar it out for entry hazard damage.</p>

<p>cune provides reflect which when combined with double intimidate - is almost unbreakable - it also gives mismagius an out to surviving pursuit when we need it to. it also takes a giant shit on stuff like last mon curselax, as i can combine seed with fero, intimidates, and cune reflect to make it pretty much useless.</p>

<p>its funny, in all my times usng this team, ive never used rest, but if something is lurking around that i need cune for, i can use it and chansey can heal bell, giving cune a new life.</p>

<p>roar is so important its not even funny - hes my only phazer and if you can't roar out big threats, then you don't really stand a chance - a lot of times i need to roar out weird stuff like dd crawdaunt that catches me off guard</p>

<p>i actually always used bold 252 hp 252 def but august told me to switch to 8 speed - good change, because it outroars out cm roar cunes maxin their stats.</p>

<p><strong>Mismagius</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Trick<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Taunt</p>

<p>the most important role of the team - not only as an anti spinner but because it revenges all that annoying crap like zam, azelf, jolteon, sceptile, etc.</p>

<p>this is probably the best anti spin, not only because of wisp which makes phan and non rest top useless, but because i can also trick them while they foresight or, if they foresight as i switch in, i just trick to completely screw them over as they spin - then i can set up my sr and spikes again and they will not have any means to spin, unless they can pursuiters</p>

<p>pursuiters are gay btw lol, against scarf krook i have to wisp which usually takes them by surprise but doom is really annoying - luckily, its kind of obvious when they are coming in. however, it can be a pain when they go top on something like chansey, then switch right to doom as i go missy - then im fucked </p>
