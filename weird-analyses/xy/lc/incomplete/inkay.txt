Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Superpower
move 2: Psycho Cut
move 3: Switcheroo
move 4: Night Slash
ability: Contrary
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 12 HP / 244 Atk / 12 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Superpower turns Inkay into a very powerful Physical Attacker and physical wall.
Psycho Cut gets great coverage with Superpower and is a powerful STAB move.
Switcheroo steals away viable items for other opponents such as Eviolite or Berry Juice.
Night Slash is another STAB move that gets great neutral coverage, while also being a great STAB move.
Set Details
========

Choice Scarf allows Inkay to reach 22 Speed with Jolly, outspeeding the entire unboosted tier.
Adamant is a viable option to make Inkay even more powerful.
236 Speed and 244 Attack give Inkay the maximum amount powerful.
12 Defense and 12 HP give it an extra stat boost into both of these stats, but isn't necessary by any means.

Usage Tips
========

Be careful about being locked into a move, as being locked into Superpower leaves it walled against Ghost-types, while Psycho Cut leaves you open to being revenge killed by Dark-types.
Rapid Spin support or Defog support is helpful as Inkay will be switchin alot if you predict wrong.
Make sure Gligar is removed, as it walls Inkay to hell and back.

Team Options
========

Swinub and Snover also make great partners as their powerful Ice-Type moves will remove Gligar.
Steel-Types such as Pawniard and Honedge form great cores with Inkay as they cover its weakness to Fairy, while Inkay can take on the Fighting-types such as Mienfoo who trouble them in return.
Rock-types such as Lileep make good partners as they can handle all the stray U-Turns and can actually handle Swirlix lacking Surf.
Wish support from the likes of Spritzee is great as Inkay has no reliable recovery.

Other Options
########

Rock Slide for coverage
Topsy-Turvy is a nifty move, but it is somewhat difficult to pull off.
Hypnosis makes Inkay a very huge threat, being able to cripple any Pokemon and continue to wreak havoc, but it has a very shaky accuracy, making it somewhat unreliable.
Trick Room as an alternative way to get around its poor Speed
Destiny Bond can catch an opponent off guard.
Payback can work well with Inkay's poor Speed, but it is somewhat unreliable.
Substitute has merit, as Inkay doesn't have too sever 4MSS, so it can afford a slot to run Substitute.
Infiltrator can be used, but Inkay's main niche is Superpower + Contrary.

Checks & Counters
########

Most Bug-Types
Swirlix along with other Fairy-types.
Any faster Scarfers can leave huge dents in Inkay
A lot of Special Attackers can leave it weak, as it lacks bulk.
Toxic Spikes wear it down a ton, it absolutely hates them.
Anything with U-Turn will take down Inkay and give the opponent momentum.
