        The name's Plus and I'm gonna bust some lead<br/>
        Lines so hot that Toast++ gonna lose his bread<br/>
        Endin' up on the Sammich Tiering Thread<br/>
        C-tier cream cheese with that Vegemite spread<br/>
        Flavors so ill that the three dogs fled<br/>
        So move me to Ubers cause I'm sizzlin' like bacon<br/>
        I shot the sheriff like the Jamaican<br/>
        As real as Oglemi on Clay Aiken<br/>
        Relationship status: taken

        Mixed set: gg<br/>
        And by the way, no re<br/>
        Though if I wanted to rep the OG<br/>
        I'd use Dawn of Kyurem in a best of three<br/>
        Battle of the Week should feature me<br/>
        First name: Plusbus, Last name: Lee<br/>

        CAP shoutout, my boy Doug's representing<br/>
        Tomohawk Hurricane spam's unrelenting<br/>
        One CAP in OU and a metagame's reinventing<br/>
        Call 'em broken and a community's lamenting<br/>
        Clashes in threads of opinions dissenting<br/>
        The smell of creativity just fermenting<br/>
        All's fun and games until the CAP presenting<br/>
        Then the battles come and go, unending
    </p>
    <p>
        Lead has been busted and rhymes have been spit<br/>
        It's about time for your boy to quit<br/>
        Nine dot nine, says Smogon's Greatest Brit<br/>
        And an exclamation point at the end of it<br/>
        Hope these bars have been nothing but a hit
