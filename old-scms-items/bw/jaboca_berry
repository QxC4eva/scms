<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder is hit by a physical damaging attack, then it will consume the Jaboca Berry, and the attacker will take 12.5% of their max HP as damage. Natural Gift becomes an 80 Base Power Dragon-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Interestingly enough, Rocky Helmet deals more damage than this Berry to the attacker, without even being used up—albeit, to users of contact moves, which do not include all than physical moves. But still, this Berry deals very little damage to the opponent for the huge cost of losing your precious item slot. If it were dealing 50% damage for any attack, then it might see some use. But at present it's pretty much unusable.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Could only be obtained by competing in the 2013 International Challenge—January, the Global Battle Union Wi-Fi tournament, or found on the Share Shelf of a player who has competed in the past.</p>
