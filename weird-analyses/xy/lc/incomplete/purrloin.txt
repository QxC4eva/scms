Moves
=======

· Sunny Day and Rain Dance are obvious, as they set up the weather for your team, if that’s your thing.

· Thunder Wave is the best support move that Purrloin can run for its job of setting up for your team, as it can both turn 1 and later in the game can stop a specific threat to weather teams.

· Dark Pulse is the better choice so that Purrloin can actually dish damage, and adds a slight element of ParaFlinch. Only downside is Purrloin’s lack of power.

· Swagger is an option instead of Dark Pulse as a ParaFusion, but I know not many people like to use that, plus Purrloin without evio might not be strong enough to really handle that.

· Encore stops Speed Boosters with Protect, as well as Shell Smashers and other mons that set up, which sets up an opportunity to get a TWave on the switch, or a free weather set up.

· Swagger can again be used instead of Encore if that’s your playstyle.

Set Details
=======

· Main plan is to set up weather, and/or cripple a sweeper.

· Evs are set so that Purrloin can at least hope to take a hit and have two shots in the match with Eject button. 13 Defense seems to work better, as it takes even a U-Turn from Gligar at max attack, which with Eject Button stops Gligar from switching out, and allows to potentially KO the Gligar.

· Eject Button is the entire crutch of the set, as it allows for Purrloin to set up, or disrupt and come back later in for the same

· For more of a suicide route, or if you’d rather switch than Eject Button, Damp Rock and Heat Rock are also options.

Usage Tips
=======

· Using Dark Pulse on a mon that you’re fairly sure is going to use Stealth Rocks or a set up move, which allows for an Encore.

· Thunder Wave can be used when a switch is imminent to paralyze whatever they send out.

· When you know you might be hit is usually the time to set up weather.

Team Options
=======

· Cholorphyll and Swiftswim users will love Purrloin for the weather.

· Vulpix likes Purrloin, as it allows for another Sun setup without having to sacrifice Vulpix, which happens often.

· Murkrow does really well as a powerful counter to mons that might hit Purrloin and cause a switch out. (I.E. U-Turn Gligar into HP Ice Murkrow)

· Slower Pokemon that can take advantage of the opposing Pokemon being paralyzed.


Other Options
#######

· Purrloin has access to Copycat, which with Prankster is extremely good, although Purrloin doesn’t have the bulk that Riolu has to abuse it.

· Prankster Substitute can always allow a scout, or also allow to both disrupt and set up weather.

· Swagger + Foul Play is always fun, but doesn’t work as well with Eject Button.

· Eviolite can be an option instead of Eject Button and focus more on Prankster’s power, weather or not.

· Purrloin has a plethora of utility moves, and also run Taunt, Trick, or Toxic as well.

· Yawn is an option I guess… Not that it’s good!

Checks and Counters
#######

· Fighting Types can pretty much OHKO Purrloin with a twitch of their fingers, and Timburr loves the Guts boost from Thunder Wave.

· Fast priority users will be a huge pain for Eject Button, and Fake Out completely stops it.

· Bulk Ground types can cause trouble.

· Other weather teams might like the free weather.

· Yanma, but you also get to Paralyze it.
