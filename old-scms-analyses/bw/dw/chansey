[Overview]

<p>Ever since GSC, Chansey has been outclassed by her evolution, Blissey. Things have changed in BW, however; with an Eviolite equipped, Chansey is actually much bulkier than her evolution, with her defensive stats rise to monstrous levels. Unlike Blissey, Chansey can take non-super effective physical hits with relative ease, something Blissey cannot do. Unfortunately, it's not all good news for Chansey. Although Eviolite boosts Chansey's defenses, her Defense stat is still rather low. Finally, Chansey falls to every commonly seen Fighting-type in the Dream World tier, most notably Breloom and Conkeldurr. Without Toxic Spikes support, Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure can easily set up all over Chansey and proceed to destroy the blob and her teammates. Don't let these flaws deter you from using Chansey, though, as she can prove to be an excellent member of your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Chansey makes for an excellent Wish supporter, with a ridiculous amount of HP, excellent Special Defense, and Eviolite to help remedy her poor Defense. Wish allows Chansey to keep herself healthy, while being able to fully heal the HP of most of her teammates, due to her high HP stat. Protect is useful for scouting for Trick, Fighting-type STAB moves, and guaranteeing that you regain HP with Wish. Alternatively, Softboiled can be used to make Chansey more healthy immediately, instead of waiting a turn; Chansey should run Softboiled if you want to ensure that Chansey's primary goal is to wall threats and her secondary objective is to heal teammates. Toxic allows Chansey to stall out many Pokemon, and is Chansey's main way of taking down Pokemon. Seismic Toss helps to prevent Chansey from being completely neutralized by Taunt, and lets Chansey have a consistent way of dealing damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Chansey's HP stat and Chansey's Defense stat; with Eviolite, Chansey becomes bulky enough to take some neutral STAB physical attacks. An alternative EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD can be used, and is quite viable. However, the one problem with this EV spread is that you will not be giving your teammates more HP with Wish, but if your team isn't too reliant on Wish passing, this spread works excellently. Chansey makes for an excellent Stealth Rock user, as she can easily set them up with her excellent bulk in conjunction with Eviolite. Rain support can prove to be excellent for Chansey, as it gives her a chance to PP stall Chandelure with Fire Blast. Since Chansey has a decent Defense stat in conjunction with Eviolite, a Counter set is viable as it can surprise physical attackers attempting to 2HKO Chansey. Thunder Wave can be run on Chansey for crippling fast sweepers such as Genesect who may switch in expecting Toxic.</p>

<p>Toxic Spikes support is Chansey's best bet when dealing with Chandelure. It takes numerous turns for Chandelure to be able to break through Chansey's Special Defense, and Toxic Spikes punishes every turn that Chandelure stays in. Physical walls such as Gliscor and Skarmory can take physical hits for Chansey, while the blob takes all special hits aimed at the aforementioned Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Chansey has a plethora of other options to support your team with, as she doesn't always need to run Wish. She has access to Aromatherapy and Heal Bell, which are useful for stall teams who want to avoid status, or sweepers who are afraid of paralysis. Chansey also has access to a number of special moves such as Flamethrower, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt. However, it's generally better to use Blissey if you want to use a special attack, because she has a higher Special Attack stat.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything with a STAB Fighting-type attack will destroy Chansey; Pokemon such as Terrakion, Breloom, Conkeldurr, and any other Fighting-type easily defeat it. Keldeo is one of the only special attackers that can beat Chansey, because its signature move, Secret Sword, targets Chansey's pitiful Defense stat. Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure can set up all over Chansey, as Chandelure can use Substitute as Chansey uses Toxic or Thunder Wave, and proceed to get to +6 Special Attack and Special Defense while Chansey sits on her butt and wastes PP. Other Substitute + Calm Mind users with 101 HP Substitute, such as Jirachi, also make for great checks to Chansey, as it will take two Seismic Tosses to break the Substitute. Toxic Spikes is one of the best checks to Chansey, as it prevents Chansey from staying on the battle field for too long, or forces her to use Heal Bell or Aromatherapy. Trick and Knock Off users are a pain for her as well, as Chansey is reliant on Eviolite to maintain her bulk.</p>
