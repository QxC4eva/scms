Always hits.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Swift will always hit the opposing Pokémon, ignoring accuracy and evasion modifiers. It can also hit Pokémon who are in the charge turn of Fly or Dig.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Swift has a small niche in being able to hit Pokemon using Fly and Dig and never failing, but it's not powerful enough and these moves are never seen competitively. Use other Normal-type moves instead.</p>
