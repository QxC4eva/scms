Overview
########

-Only fast Fairy-type
-Typically runs a scarf so it can be a powerful check to dragons in meta
-Overdose of support options can serve as good filler
-can switch in on special attackers once
-immune to dragon nigga

-v physically frail and thus weak to priority users
-has to run scarf so it cant switch moves q__q
-bad se coverage outside of m00nblast

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Moonblast
move 2: Psychic / Psyshock
move 3: Dazzling Gleam
move 4: Thunderbolt / Focus Blast
ability: Telepathy / Trace
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 140 Def / 140 SpA / 228 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
-Moonblast is main stab bc fairy is jizz-tier and garde is basically only offensive fairy
-Garde doesnt have much to do with its other moves legit theyre all filler
-Psyshock provides decent neutral coverage against fires/poisons
-Thunderbolt hits charizard, focus blast hits steels but it's Focus Ass
-Spread gives me boners, even weak spread

Set Details
========
-OHKO Garchomp 100% of the time; outspeed noivern
-if you instead want more spe you can do timid 252 spa 172 spe 84 def but you will have like a 12% chance to get trolled by moonblast and nearly always die to talon bb
-couldnt always live talon BB even with full defensive investment so I just maximized mix bulk
-telepathy if u have an eq/boom, otherwise use trace its nifty but situational af

Usage Tips
========
-try to avoid switching it in on anything but dargon moves and weak/middling neutral special hits
-use it to threaten and ko dragons/darks; mostly spam moonblast but use another move as the situation demands
-

Team options
========
-intimidators are especially good bc then u live things like scizor bb (mence/scrafty/krook)
-pokemon that beat steel and fire types are nice (mence/scrafty/krook, fire types of your own)
-

Bulky Support
########
set name: Bulky Support
move1: Moonblast
move2: Psychic / Protect
move3: Will-o-Wisp
move4: Ally Switch / Trick Room / Taunt
ability: Telepathy / Trace
item: Lum Berry / Sitrus Berry
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========
-Moonblast and psyshock as before offer good dual STAB coverage
-Will-o-wisp lets you handle dragons in a different way which is why you dont need the spa evs, and also handle most common garde switch-ins. also burning shit is great
-Last move depends on team; taunt for faster teams that dont like amoonguss / prankster para / prankswag, trick room for slow teams that like tr, ally switch if youre not particularly worried about either it's more or less follow me but at +1 prio

Set Details
========
-that is what garde looks like with optimized mix bulk, kinda sad yep
-abilities: see above
-lum if you are using taunt is good; otherwise i'd probably go sitrus
-safety goggles can also be used if you're a real huge fan of shitting on amoonguss

Usage Tips
========
-focuses less on trying to ohko things with moonblast—still a nice perk though—and more on supporting the team with its other two moves
