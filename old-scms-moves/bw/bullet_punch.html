<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of +1. Damage is boosted to 1.2x by the ability Iron Fist.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Though Bullet Punch may be relatively weak and may have fairly poor coverage, it is one of the most common priority moves in the game. Largely, this is due to Scizor, which packs an excellent Attack stat, Technician, and STAB on the move. With a Choice Band equipped, Scizor can easily revenge kill Pokemon weak to the move, as well as opponents that have been sufficiently worn down. Threatening with Bullet Punch, Scizor can often steal the momentum with a powerful U-turn. Scizor can also use the move to sweep with a Swords Dance set. Otherwise, Bullet Punch is generally a weak move, with only Metagross and perhaps Hitmontop achieving any notable power with it, but may be considered on Pokemon like Machamp and Hariyama, to pick off heavily weakened foes such as those which have hung on with a Focus Sash.</p>
