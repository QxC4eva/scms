<h2>Community Contributor Alumnus</h2>

<p>Community Contributor Alumnus is a very exclusive badge. Alumnus badges are typically given to users who have a certain badge and quit that section or Smogon as a whole. Requirements vary, but Community Contributor Alumnus is particularly difficult to get, as it requires one year or more of consistent and substantial contribution. This means no stopping for a month and a half because you're bored or something. So far, only one has been given out. The user's name is <strong>Harsha</strong>, who is best known for his insightful posts and running of the Outsiders challenge, a challenge that compelled players to ladder with low-usage Pokemon in order to get themselves a spot in the project's hall of fame. More may be given out in the future, but know that they will be very few in number.</p>
