[Overview]

<p>Ever since its release in GSC, Forretress has been the premier entry hazard user. With excellent defensive typing, good defensive stats, and an impressive support movepool, Forretress is a top-tier defensive threat. However, Forretress is not without its faults. Many powerful attackers, such as Genesect, Keldeo, and Garchomp, run rampant in DW OU, all of whom can take advantage of Forretress. Don't let these faults deter you from using Forretress, though; with the correct team support, it will prove to be an excellent member of your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Forretress's excellent typing and good stats let it check a plethora of commonly used Pokemon in DW, such as Garchomp and Gliscor. A specially defensive spread allows Forretress to more easily switch into weak special attacks, such as Scald, and is therefore recommended. Rapid Spin is what sets Forretress apart from Ferrothorn, its largest defensive competitor, as spin support is vital on many teams. Volt Switch is another move that Forretress has over Ferrothorn; with Volt Switch, Forretress can fill a niche of an excellent defensive pivot that can take a hit, set up entry hazards, and maintain momentum. Additionally, Volt Switch enables Forretress to lure in spinblockers, most notably Chandelure and Jellicent, and switch out to Tyranitar, trapping the aforementioned Ghost-types. Hidden Power Ice, although seemingly silly on a Pokemon with such a low Special Attack stat, is surprisingly useful. With the given EV spread, Hidden Power Ice nets a 2HKO on Garchomp, Gliscor, and Dragonite, all of whom are popular Pokemon in DW. The fourth moveslot should be tailored to your team's needs; Forretress can set up Stealth Rock with ease, but if another member of your team can set it up, Spikes and Toxic Spikes are both viable alternatives.</p>

<p>The choice between Leftovers and Shed Shell is a significant one. Leftovers is preferred because Forretress doesn't have access to a reliable recovery move outside of Rest, so the extra HP gained from Leftovers is invaluable. On the other hand, Shed Shell prevents Forretress from being destroyed by Chandelure, one of the most threatening Pokemon in DW. Keep in mind that Volt Switch allows Forretress to escape the wrath of Chandelure either on the switch or if your opponent gets greedy and goes for Substitute. Another entry hazard could be used over Hidden Power Ice, but this would allow some of the most threatening sweepers in DW, such as Garchomp and Gliscor, to set up on Forretress with impunity.</p>

<p>Terrakion relies on Stealth Rock support to wear down its checks and counters, such as Skarmory and Gliscor. Additionally, Forretress and Dragonite have decent defensive synergy. Jellicent also has good defensive synergy with Forretress and can spinblock, which prevents Forretress's hard work from going to waste. Heatran can switch into the Fire-type attacks that give Forretress trouble, and can utilize Stealth Rock to free up a moveslot for Forretress to lay a more uncommon hazard. Politoed is a cool partner as it sets up rain, which lessens the damage Forretress takes from Fire-type moves.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although a specially defensive spread is good for making Forretress an excellent mixed defensive pivot, a physically defensive set is equally viable. Rapid Spin is arguably the most important move in the set, as it benefits just about all teams. Furthermore, Forretress can switch into most Tyranitar, Bronzong, and Ferrothorn without fear. Volt Switch is what sets Forretress apart from other defensive Steel-types; it gives Forretress the ability to not only tank hits, but to maintain momentum for your team too. Volt Switch is also excellent for luring in Ghost-types, most commonly Jellicent and Chandelure; you can then switch to a Pursuit trapper to get rid of them. Hidden Power Ice might seem like a strange pick considering Forretress's low Special Attack stat, but the move is surprisingly useful. For instance, it lets Forretress 2HKO Gliscor, as well as Garchomp and Dragonite, after Stealth Rock. Additionally, Forretress's other offensive moves, such as Gyro Ball and Earthquake, are rather mediocre. Finally, the last moveslot depends on what your team needs; run Stealth Rock if your team has no other user of the move, and Spikes or Toxic Spikes if your team already has a Stealth Rock user.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice between Leftovers and Shed Shell is very important. Leftovers is the primary option because Forretress doesn't have access to a reliable recovery move, and thus appreciates that recovery that Leftovers provides. However, Shed Shell is useful for switching out from Chandelure, who can otherwise set up on, and easily eliminate, it. Remember, though, that Forretress can always use Volt Switch to escape Chandelure.</p>

<p>This set deals with physical attackers such as Garchomp and Dragonite much more comfortably than the specially defensive variant does. Jellicent appreciates the entry hazards that Forretress provides as it can force switches with Taunt; Jellicent also likes having powerful Dragon-types removed and can block Rapid Spin, ensuring that you have the hazard advantage. Tyranitar also likes having Dragon-types eliminated as they can demolish it, can set up Stealth Rock to let Forretress lay another hazard, and checks special attackers that Forretress hates, such as Heatran and Ninetales. Politoed is a good partner as it summons rain, which reduces the damage Forretress takes from Fire-type moves.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Earthquake and Gyro Ball are good attacking moves, but Hidden Power Ice is much more useful as it enables Forretress to check Dragon-types and Gliscor. Toxic cripples bulky Water-types that switch into Forretress, such as Politoed and Jellicent, but Forretress often can't spare a moveslot. Forretress can viably run a dual screens set, but hazards are often more useful, and there are many other faster Pokemon who can run a dual screens set much better than Forretress. A ChestoRest set might let Forretress live a little longer than usual, but it will miss the passive recovery from Leftovers and the moveslot it had to sacrifice to Rest.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As Forretress doesn't have much of an offensive presence, it's rather easy to check. Genesect and Heatran can scorch Forretress with Flamethrower, and offensive Deoxys-S with Hidden Power Fire. Chandelure can trap all Forretress lacking Shed Shell and OHKO with Overheat or Fire Blast before Forretress can escape with Volt Switch. Bulky Water-types such as Politoed can threaten Forretress with Scald; a burn also significantly reduces Forretress's longevity. Jellicent can Taunt Forretress as well, which prevents it from setting up entry hazards. Manaphy can set up Tail Glow without fear, then proceed to destroy Forretress and potentially your whole team with a boosted Surf.</p>

<p>Forretress has trouble defeating set-up sweepers that don't take significant damage from Hidden Power Ice. Excadrill can set up Swords Dance on Forretress and proceed to 2HKO with Earthquake, as it fears none of Forretress's moves. Breloom can Spore Forretress, set up with Swords Dance, and 2HKO it with Mach Punch.</p>
