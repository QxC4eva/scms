<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Hazards are some of the most  important aspects of teams in RU. With  Pokemon such as Moltres,  Scyther, and Entei running rampant, hazards are  extremely important in  dealing with these threats; these Pokemon would  be much harder to take  down without Stealth Rock or Spikes. Furthermore,  due to the small  number of spinners in the tier relative to the large  number of  spinblockers, hazards are extremely hard to remove from the  field.  Because of the lack of spinners, hazards are extremely effective  on  both offensive and defensive teams, which allows for more flexibility   when choosing a hazard user. There are both offensive users of hazards,   such as Aerodactyl and Accelgor, and defensive users of hazards, which   include Steelix and Roselia.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is the most important  hazard in the tier, as it prevents  offensive behemoths such as Moltres  and Galvantula from sweeping. One of  the reasons why Manectric is used  instead of Galvantula is because it's  not weak to Stealth Rock. Stealth  Rock is also the only hazard that  affects Flying-types and Pokemon  with the Levitate ability. This will  help wear down the opposing team,  as there are no other forms of  residual damage in RU besides status  conditions.</p>

<p>Spikes is the next best hazard in RU;  it is easy to fit a Spikes user  onto a team due to the good amount of  Spikes users to choose from. Some  Spikes users, such as Scolipede, are  extremely fast, and others, for  example Ferroseed, are incredibly bulky  and can set up very easily.  Stealth Rock coupled with a few layers of  Spikes makes it so that  sweepers such as Lilligant can easily dispose  of what would otherwise be  their best counters.</p>

<p>The final entry hazard, Toxic Spikes, is used less than  the other  hazards, and for good reason. Poison-types such as Amoonguss, Drapion, Roselia, and Qwilfish are somewhat common, and they will absorb Toxic Spikes upon switching  in, making all  efforts to set up useless. Also, like Spikes,  Flying-types and Pokemon  with the Levitate ability are immune to Toxic  Spikes, so its usefulness  is devalued even more. Nevertheless, Toxic  Spikes can be effective if  the opponent lacks these Pokemon, as  becoming poisoned upon switching in  is extremely unpleasant. </p>

<p>Seeing how powerful hazards can  really be, Pokemon such as Cryogonal and  Sandslash have risen in usage  due to their ability to spin, which in  turn caused Ghost-types to rise  in usage. However, this usually leads to  a fierce battle between  players trying to keep hazards on the field or  trying to remove them.  Hazards play a huge role in the RU tier, and many  battles are centered  around keeping them on the field or preventing  them from being set up.</p>

<h2><a name="stealth_rock">Stealth Rock</a></h2>

<p>Stealth Rock is a staple on RU teams,  as Fire-types would otherwise run  rampant. Entei, Magmortar, Moltres,  and Typhlosion are all much easier  to deal with while Stealth Rock is  on the field, as they can only switch  in a limited number of times, and  the additional damage dealt by Flare  Blitz or Life Orb recoil will  rack up quickly alongside Stealth Rock  damage. Stealth Rock also  weakens strong walls such as Flareon and  Mandibuzz by turning some  2HKOs into OHKOs. Stealth Rock should be the  first hazard to be set up,  as one of the best spinners, Cryogonal, is  weak to it, which makes it  much harder for the opponent to remove your  hazards. The lack of  reliable spinners and the plethora of Pokemon that  are weak to Stealth  Rock make it the most fearsome hazard in the tier.  Stealth Rock has  always been an important aspect on every team, and this  likewise  applies in RU, especially due to the plethora of good Stealth  Rock  users.</p>

<h2><a name="spikes">Spikes and Toxic Spikes</a></h2>

<p>Spikes-stacking is a very effective strategy. With only a  few reliable  spinners in RU, Spikes can easily dismantle any team with  grounded  Pokemon. Spikes will cause Pokemon with no reliable recovery, such as Rhydon, to be taken down more easily by  powerful  sweepers. Most Spikes users can set them up easily, as they  are  extremely fast or extremely bulky, allowing for many opportunities  to  set up.</p>

<p>Toxic Spikes, on the other hand, are  less effective. There are many  Pokemon with the Levitate ability in RU,  meaning that they are immune to  Toxic Spikes. There are also many common Poison-types—including Amoonguss, Drapion, Roselia, and Qwilfish—that can all absorb  Toxic Spikes upon switching in. Once  these Pokemon are eliminated,  however, Toxic Spikes can cripple  grounded walls, such as Lanturn and  Slowking, and can be very hard for  the opponent to deal with.</p>

<h2><a name="users">The Users</a></h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/208.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Steelix</strong><br />
Type: Steel / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 85 Atk / 200 Def / 55 SpA / 65 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Ability: Rock Head / Sturdy / Sheer Force<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>With a massive base 200 Defense and great defensive  typing, Steelix is  one of the most reliable Stealth Rock users. By  walling nearly every  physical attacker in RU, Steelix will have  multiple opportunities to set  up Stealth Rock throughout the match.  Additionally, with some Special  Defense investment, Steelix beats one  of the most common spinners,  Cryogonal, with Gyro Ball, so Cryogonal  can't risk switching in to spin.  It also scares out Kabutops with a  STAB Earthquake. One of the  downsides to Steelix is its low Speed, so  Taunt users such as  Aerodactyl, Drapion, and Mandibuzz can prevent it  from setting up,  although the former two fear Steelix's STAB moves.  Overall, Steelix is  one of the best, most reliable users of Stealth  Rock in the tier.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/142.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Aerodactyl</strong><br />
Type: Rock / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 105 Atk / 65 Def / 60 SpA / 75 SpD / 130 Spe<br />
Ability: Rock Head / Pressure / Unnerve<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Being the second fastest Pokemon in  the RU tier, Aerodactyl will almost  always set up Stealth Rock unless  the opponent has a Whimsicott with  Taunt. Speaking of Taunt, Aerodactyl  also has the move, so it can  prevent the setup of Stealth Rock itself.  Additionally, with base 105  Attack, Aerodactyl can dent the opposing  team with a powerful STAB Stone  Edge. The only things that stop  Aerodactyl from setting up are Magic  Coat and Prankster Taunt Pokemon.  When choosing a Pokemon to lead with,  Aerodactyl is a great choice for  setting up Stealth Rock as early as  possible, damaging the opponent's  team, and preventing opposing Pokemon  from setting up.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/112.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Rhydon</strong><br />
Type: Ground / Rock<br />
Base Stats: 105 HP / 130 Atk / 120 Def / 45 SpA / 45 SpD / 40 Spe<br />
Ability: Lightningrod / Rock Head / Reckless<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Like Steelix, Rhydon has a massive  base Defense stat as well as many  good resistances. However, unlike  Steelix, Rhydon has a huge base 130  Attack and can set up on the likes  of Entei. It can use Eviolite to  boost its defenses, which allows it to  set up more easily.  Unfortunately, Rhydon does not have reliable  recovery, and cannot use  Leftovers unless you want to sacrifice the  benefits of Eviolite; this  makes it harder for it to repeatedly set up  Stealth Rock throughout the  game. Also, due to its high Attack stat,  Rhydon can demolish most Taunt  users, which will almost always  guarantee Stealth Rock being set up.  Rhydon should not be seen as  inferior to Steelix, but instead be  considered on its own merits as a  solid Stealth Rock user.  </p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/485.png" alt="" /><img src="/download/sprites/bw/486.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Uxie and Mesprit</strong></p>

<p>Uxie<br />
Type: Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 75 Atk / 130 Def / 75 SpA / 130 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Mesprit<br />
Type: Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 105 Atk / 105 Def / 105 SpA / 105 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Uxie and Mesprit are both great users  of Stealth Rock due to their bulk,  typing, and Levitate ability. Uxie  has higher defenses and Speed than  Mesprit, but weaker offenses; Uxie  also has Memento, whereas Mesprit has  Healing Wish. If you need a fast,  bulky Pokemon, use Uxie because of  its base 95 Speed and excellent 75 /  130 / 130 defenses. Mesprit, on the  other hand, is a bit slower with  base 80 Speed, but has a high base 105  Special Attack and access to Ice  Beam. Ice Beam demolishes Sandslash, a  common spinner; this will help  keep Stealth Rock on the field for the  remainder of the match. In  addition, they both have access to Psyshock,  which can OHKO Cryogonal  and prevent it from spinning. Finally, both  pixies are able to learn  U-turn, so they can come in later in the match  if Stealth Rock happens  to have been removed.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/28.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Sandslash</strong><br />
Type: Ground<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 100 Atk / 110 Def / 45 SpA / 55 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Ability: Sand Veil / Sand Rush<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>With mediocre base 75 HP and great  base 110 Defense, Sandslash makes for  a solid user of Stealth Rock.  Resistances to Rock- and Electric-type  attacks and the ability to check  many physical attackers give Sandslash  many opportunities to set up  Stealth Rock. Sandslash is also one of the  only RU Pokemon with both  Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, which makes it a  great team supporter.  However, Sandslash doesn't do much outside of  these two things, which  leaves it outclassed by Pokemon such as  Kabutops. Nevertheless, if you  need a solid physical wall with both  Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin,  Sandslash should not be overlooked. Lastly,  it can run moves such as  Knock Off, Swords Dance, and Toxic to become a  better teammate.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/653.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Golurk</strong><br />
Type: Ground / Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 89 HP / 124 Atk / 80 Def / 55 SpA / 80 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Ability: Iron Fist / Klutz / No Guard<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Golurk is the only Ghost-type in RU to get Stealth Rock,  which enables  it to both set up Stealth Rock and block the opponent  from spinning it  away. Golurk also has a great base 124 Attack stat and  usable defensive  stats. However, this does not mean that Golurk is a  good spinblocker or  Stealth Rock user. It unfortunately loses to the  two most common  spinners, Cryogonal and Kabutops, and is walled by  Sandslash as well;  its low Speed stat doesn't do it any favors either.  Overall, Golurk can  set up Stealth Rock and prevent the opponent from  spinning for a turn or  two, but is mediocre in general.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/36.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Clefable</strong><br />
Type: Normal<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 70 Atk / 73 Def / 85 SpA / 90 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Ability: Cute Charm / Magic Guard / Unaware<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Clefable is a very versatile Pokemon.  It is great at supporting its  team, especially because it has access  to Stealth Rock. In addition, it  has the Magic Guard ability, which  makes it immune to all forms of  residual damage, including hazards, and  makes Clefable hard to take  down. It has decent 95 / 73 / 90 defenses,  which allows it to set up  Stealth Rock in many different situations.  Furthermore, its extremely  wide movepool can support itself, its team,  and has the ability to take  out opposing spinners; most notably, it can  use Heal Bell and Wish to  heal itself or teammates or Softboiled to  heal itself. To take out  spinners, Clefable can use Double-Edge to take  out Cryogonal, Grass Knot  to take out Kabutops, or Ice Beam to take  out Sandslash.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/651.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Druddigon</strong><br />
Type: Dragon<br />
Base Stats: 77 HP / 120 Atk / 90 Def / 60 SpA / 90 SpD / 48 Spe<br />
Ability: Rough Skin / Sheer Force / Mold Breaker<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Druddigon is quite the unique Stealth Rock user, as it  is a Dragon-type.  However, it does a good job at setting up, as its 77 /  90 / 90 defenses  and plethora of resistances give it many chances to  use Stealth Rock.  Furthermore, it can use either Roar or Dragon Tail to  phaze the opponent  and rack up entry hazard damage. Outrage will also  hit hard, and will  wear down the opponent's Pokemon after Stealth Rock.  Finally,  Druddigon's Rough Skin ability causes the opponent to take  damage every  time it uses Rapid Spin, which enables Druddigon to wear  down spinners  to have a better chance of keeping Stealth Rock on the  field.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/241.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Miltank</strong><br />
Type: Normal<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 80 Atk / 105 Def / 40 SpA / 70 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Ability: Thick Fat / Scrappy / Sap Sipper<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Like Clefable, Miltank is another  versatile Stealth Rock user. It has  good 95 / 105 / 70 defenses and  three great abilities; Thick Fat helps  it take on Fire-types as well as  Ice-types such as Cryogonal, while Sap  Sipper gives it an immunity to  Grass-type attacks and an Attack boost  when hit by one. Scrappy allows  it to smack spinblockers with its  Normal-type STAB. Miltank is also  pretty fast for a cow, boasting a high  base 100 Speed which will give  it a few opportunities to set up Stealth  Rock before it gets Taunted.  It has reliable recovery in Milk Drink,  which allows it to set up  Stealth Rock throughout the match if  necessary. Finally, it can use  moves such as Thunder Wave and Heal Bell  to support its team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Kabutops</strong><br />
Type: Rock / Water<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 115 Atk / 105 Def / 65 SpA / 70 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Ability: Swift Swim / Battle Armor / Weak Armor<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Kabutops is a Pokemon known for having four-moveslot  syndrome, as it has  access to many useful moves, including Stealth  Rock, Rapid Spin, Swords  Dance, Rain Dance, Aqua Jet, Stone Edge,  Waterfall, and Superpower.  Among the things that stand out are its high  base 115 Attack, good base  105 Defense, and decent base 80 Speed. Its  Rock / Water typing grants it  several useful resistances that allow it  to set up Stealth Rock easily.  It can also use Rapid Spin to remove the  opponent's entry hazards, as  well as Swords Dance to sweep. One of the  most common spinners,  Cryogonal, cannot spin on Kabutops either  because it will risk being  KOed by Aqua Jet or Stone Edge. Kabutops has  a few other options, but if  you can fit Stealth Rock onto its set,  Kabutops will not let you down.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/647.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Accelgor</strong><br />
Type: Bug<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 70 Atk / 40 Def / 100 SpA / 60 SpD / 145 Spe<br />
Ability: Hydration / Sticky Hold / Unburden<br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes</p>

<p>Accelgor is the fastest RU Pokemon,  so it will almost always have the  opportunity to set up Spikes before  the opponent can do anything.  Accelgor also has a decent base 100  Special Attack stat and strong  coverage with Bug Buzz, Focus Blast, and  Hidden Power Rock, which makes  it a great Spikes user on offensive  teams. Accelgor can also play the  "suicide lead" role with Final Gambit  by setting up a few layers of  Spikes and then sacrificing itself to  kill a spinner. Accelgor is the  choice to consider whenever making an  offensive Spikes-stacking team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/627.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Ferroseed</strong><br />
Type: Grass / Steel<br />
Base Stats: 44 HP / 50 Atk / 91 Def / 24 SpA / 86 SpD / 10 Spe<br />
Ability: Iron Barbs<br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes, Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Ferroseed is one of the best hazard users in RU, as it  learns both  Stealth Rock and Spikes. It has great typing and can  utilize Eviolite to  boost its defenses. Ferroseed can fully wall some  of the strongest  physical attackers in RU, including Feraligatr and  Klinklang, which  gives it the opportunity to set up hazards while the  opponent switches  out. Access to Thunder Wave and Leech Seed will also  force switches,  which will rack up entry hazard damage on the enemy.  Ferroseed is  extremely slow, however, so it is very prone to Taunt and  cannot do much  back to Taunt users. It also lacks recovery outside of  Leech Seed, so  one must play carefully when setting up with Ferroseed.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/588.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Crustle</strong><br />
Type: Bug / Rock<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 95 Atk / 125 Def / 65 SpA / 75 SpD / 45 Spe<br />
Ability: Sturdy / Shell Armor / Weak Armor<br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes, Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Crustle is another Pokemon with both Stealth Rock and  Spikes. It has an  amazing base 125 Defense and a usable base 95 Attack.  However, low Speed  and a poor Bug / Rock typing leave it with many  weaknesses. It does  have the Sturdy ability, however, so it is almost  always guaranteed  Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes against a Pokemon  that can OHKO it.  Crustle works best mid-game, as it can come in on a  Pokemon with a low  Attack stat such as Steelix and set up Spikes. All  in all, however,  Crustle is outclassed by other hazard users, and is  better used as a  Shell Smash sweeper.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/457.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Drapion</strong><br />
Type: Poison / Dark<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 90 Atk / 110 Def / 60 SpA / 75 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Ability: Battle Armor / Sniper / Keen Eye<br />
Usable entry hazards: Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Drapion has decent base 70 / 110 / 75  defenses as well as a great Poison  / Dark typing. This gives Drapion  many opportunities to set up Toxic  Spikes, as it has good bulk and  resists common Grass-, Psychic-, Ghost-,  and Dark-type moves. It can  run an effective specially defensive set to  counter and set up on  strong special attackers such as Mesprit,  Sceptile, and Sigilyph.  Furthermore, with Taunt, Drapion can prevent the  opponent from using  Taunt on Drapion or phazing it out, and hence set  up another layer of  Toxic Spikes. Finally, Drapion gets Whirlwind, which  allows it to force  the opponent out which will cause an opposing  Pokemon to be poisoned  by its deadly Toxic Spikes. Keep in mind that  Drapion itself counters  Toxic Spikes, as its Poison typing allows it  absorb them upon switching  in.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/315.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Roselia</strong><br />
Type: Grass / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 60 Atk / 45 Def / 100 SpA / 80 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Ability: Natural Cure / Poison Point / Leaf Guard<br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Roselia should almost always use Spikes instead of Toxic  Spikes because  it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome. With Eviolite  and good base 80  Special Defense, Roselia can wall most special  attackers in the tier,  giving it many opportunities to set up hazards.  Its Grass / Poison  typing also gives it many useful resistances. With  good Special Attack,  the Natural Cure ability, and good support moves  in Sleep Powder and  Leech Seed, Roselia is one of the best hazard users  in RU. Just keep in  mind that Sleep Powder and Spikes are illegal on  the same set, so you  will have to use Toxic Spikes should you want to  put the opponent to  sleep. Roselia should always be considered for a  hazard user on  defensive teams.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/211.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Qwilfish</strong><br />
Type: Water / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 95 Atk / 75 Def / 55 SpA / 55 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Ability: Poison Point / Swift Swim / Intimidate<br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Qwilfish is quite the intimidating Pokemon, as it can  set up on many  physical attackers in RU including Entei and Escavalier  due to its  Intimidate ability. Great Water / Poison typing gives it  many  resistances, which allows Qwilfish to set up Spikes or Toxic  Spikes with  ease. It also has a decent base 85 Speed, which allows it  to use Taunt  to prevent the opposing team from setting up. Finally, a  STAB Waterfall  coming off of a base 95 Attack will scare away spinners  such as  Cryogonal, Kabutops, and Sandslash. Qwilfish, though somewhat  forgotten,  is still a reliable user of hazards and a good team  supporter with  moves such as Haze and Thunder Wave.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/573.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Scolipede</strong><br />
Type: Bug / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 90 Atk / 89 Def / 55 SpA / 69 SpD / 112 Spe<br />
Ability: Poison Point / Swarm / Quick Feet<br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Scolipede is the fifth fastest RU Pokemon, and, like  Accelgor, is a  great hazard user on offensive teams. With a unique base  112 Speed and  base 90 Attack, Scolipede poses a great threat and  boasts the ability to  set up hazards quickly. It also has access to  Swords Dance, so it can  use Spikes to put its counters into KO range.  With Focus Sash, Scolipede  can usually get up two layers of hazards or  use its 1 HP to its  advantage to do a massive amount of damage to  anything with  Swarm-boosted Megahorn. Sadly, Scolipede is walled by the  ever-present  Ghost-types, so it is usually outclassed by other hazard  users.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/235.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Smeargle</strong><br />
Type: Normal<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 20 Atk / 35 Def / 20 SpA / 45 SpD / 75 Spe<br />
Ability: Own Tempo / Technician / Moody<br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes, Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Smeargle is perhaps the best hazard user in RU, because  it learns all  three entry hazards, Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic  Spikes, due to  Sketch. With Spore, a 100% accuracy sleep-inducing move,  Smeargle can  put the foe to sleep, use Stealth Rock, take a hit due to  Focus Sash,  and set up Spikes. It also has Magic Coat, which allows it  to bounce  back hazards or Taunt from faster foes such as Aerodactyl  and Drapion.  Smeargle will almost always get up Stealth Rock and one  layer of Spikes,  unless it is faced with a Pokemon with the Vital  Spirit or Insomnia  abilities.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/139.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Omastar</strong><br />
Type: Rock / Water<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 60 Atk / 125 Def / 115 SpA / 70 SpD / 55 Spe<br /> 
Ability: Swift Swim / Shell Armor / Weak Armor<br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes, Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Support Omastar is always overlooked by Shell Smash  Omastar, but its  defensive set is very usable. Omastar has a huge base  125 Defense and  decent typing—perfect for a hazard user. Omastar can  take hits from the  likes of Entei, Aggron, Sandslash, and Steelix and  threaten them out due  to its base 115 Special Attack and super  effective STAB moves,  resulting in a free turn to use Stealth Rock or  Spikes.</p>

<h2><a name="prevent">Preventing Hazards</a></h2>

<h3><a name="rapid_spin">Rapid Spin</a></h3>

<p>Rapid Spin is the most common way of  removing entry hazards; in fact,  it's a move designed to remove  hazards. The RU tier does not have many  good spinners, but Pokemon such  as Cryogonal and Kabutops can usually  get the job done, as these are  the two which can beat the most common  Ghost-type Pokemon. Aside from  that, if you are desperate to remove  hazards, you can use Pokemon with  Foresight, although it's usually a  waste of a moveslot. Moreover, the  only common user of the move,  Hitmonchan, is a Pokemon that struggles  to do well in the tier.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/645.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Cryogonal</strong><br />
Type: Ice<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 50 Atk / 30 Def / 95 SpA / 135 SpD / 105 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Cryogonal is one of the most reliable spinners in RU. It  is weak to  Stealth Rock, but also immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes  due to its  Levitate ability, a trait that every spinner wishes it had.  Cryogonal  has an insane base 135 Special Defense, good base 95 Special  Attack, and  great base 105 Speed. This gives it the ability to beat  almost every  spinblocker in the tier. To combat this, most  Spikes-stacking teams use  Choice Band or Blackglasses Spiritomb, which  can OHKO Cryogonal.  However, Cryogonal has Reflect up its sleeve, which  grants it the  ability to survive Spiritomb's attacks and 3-4HKO it  with a powerful  STAB Ice Beam. However, Cryogonal will have to  sacrifice a move for  Reflect, and needs Haze and Toxic to beat Cresselia.  Cryogonal must pick between  one or the other, but it is still one of  the best spinners in the tier.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Kabutops</strong><br />
Type: Rock / Water<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 115 Atk / 105 Def / 65 SpA / 70 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Ability: Swift Swim / Battle Armor / Weak Armor</p>

<p>Good typing, base 115 Attack, base 80 Speed, and base  105 Defense make  Kabutops an overall great Pokemon and a great spinner.  With Swords Dance  and a Life Orb, Kabutops can OHKO many Ghost-types  and take a hit or  two due to its decent bulk. It also has much utility  outside of  spinning, such as the ability to revenge kill threats such  as Typhlosion  and Moltres with Aqua Jet.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/28.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Sandslash</strong><br />
Type: Ground<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 100 Atk / 110 Def / 45 SpA / 55 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Ability: Sand Veil / Sand Rush</p>

<p>Sandslash is well-known for being a useless support  Pokemon, as it can't  do much outside of setting up Stealth Rock and is  not very good at  spinning. However, Sandslash still has its merits, and  has a way of  getting around spinblockers with Swords Dance, Knock Off,  or Toxic. It  has a good base 100 Attack, and with Swords Dance further  boosting it,  Sandslash can overcome some Ghost-types. It also has  Night Slash to hit  Ghost-types with the Levitate ability such as Rotom  and Misdreavus super  effectively. Sandslash can also use a Lum Berry so  it does not get  burned by Rotom or Misdreavus. Knock Off and Toxic  will wear down  opposing Ghost-types, allowing for Sandslash's teammates  to take them  down more easily. It can then spin with ease as many  physical attackers  cannot OHKO it due to its base 110 Defense.</p>

<strong>Hitmonchan</strong><br />
Type: Fighting<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 105 Atk / 79 Def / 35 SpA / 110 SpD / 76 Spe<br />
Ability: Keen Eye / Iron Fist / Inner Focus</p>

<p>Hitmonchan has good overall stats: base 50 HP, base 105  Attack, base 79  Defense, base 110 Special Defense, and base 76 Speed.  Despite this,  Hitmonchan cannot beat Ghost-types. That is, of course,  unless you are  willing to run Foresight, which is not recommended  because Hitmonchan  already has four-moveslot syndrome. The inability to  hit Ghost-types  with its main STAB attacks is extremely unappealing  for a spinner, and  sacrificing a moveslot for Foresight is unappetizing  as well.  Furthermore, Hitmonchan is outclassed by other Fighting-type  Pokemon and  is not very useful overall. Hitmonchan's cousin, Hitmonlee,  is even  worse at spinning, as it is much less bulky.</p>
 
<h3><a name="taunt">Taunt</a></h3>

<p>Taunt is a somewhat unreliable method  of dealing with hazards because  you have to have the Taunt user on the  field at the same time as the  hazard user. However, fast Taunt users  such as Aerodactyl and Drapion  can prevent Pokemon such as Mesprit and  Clefable from setting up, while  they can set up on their own.  Nevertheless, most hazard users are sent  out first, so you can counter  them by leading with a Taunt user.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/142.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Aerodactyl</strong><br />
Type: Rock / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 105 Atk / 65 Def / 60 SpA / 75 SpD / 130 Spe<br /> 
Ability: Rock Head / Pressure / Unnerve</p>

<p>Aerodactyl has one of the fastest Taunts in RU due to  its base 130  Speed. As a lead, it will almost always prevent the  opposing lead from  setting up hazards, while Aerodactyl can then do so  itself. It can also  use Roost to heal itself, which allows it to come  in later and prevent  the opponent from setting up again.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/457.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Drapion</strong><br />
Type: Poison / Dark<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 90 Atk / 110 Def / 60 SpA / 75 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Ability: Battle Armor / Sniper / Keen Eye</p>

<p>With good base 95 Speed, Drapion will outrun hazard  users such as  Smeargle, Uxie, and Mesprit. It can then set up Swords  Dance or Toxic  Spikes while the opponent switches out, which can help  Drapion dent the  opposing team. It does, however, have trouble with  Sandslash, Rhydon,  and Steelix because they can all hit Drapion hard  with a STAB  Earthquake.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/660.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Mandibuzz</strong><br />
Type: Dark / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 110 HP / 65 Atk / 105 Def / 55 SpA / 95 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Ability: Big Pecks / Overcoat / Weak Armor</p>

<p>Mandibuzz is a great wall, and has good Speed to go  along with it. This  lets it beat out the slower hazard setters such as  Steelix and  Sandslash, who cannot touch Mandibuzz unless they carry the  rare Stone  Edge. Even so, Mandibuzz has Roost to mitigate the damage.  Overall,  Mandibuzz is great for preventing slower walls from setting up  hazards.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/211.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Qwilfish</strong><br />
Type: Water / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 95 Atk / 75 Def / 55 SpA / 55 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Ability: Poison Point / Swift Swim / Intimidate</p>

<p>Qwilfish has a decent base 85 Speed, which allows it to  outrun most  Stealth Rock users. Intimidate also helps it to beat  physically  attacking hazard users such as Steelix, Sandslash, and  Kabutops, while  Waterfall scares out Rhydon and Golurk. Qwilfish can  then deal damage  with Waterfall or set up hazards of its own while the  opponent switches  out.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/575.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Whimsicott</strong><br />
Type: Grass<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 67 Atk / 85 Def / 77 SpA / 75 SpD / 116 Spe<br />
Ability: Prankster / Infiltrator / Chlorophyll</p>

<p>Whimsicott can Taunt any Pokemon and prevent them from  setting up  hazards due to its Prankster ability, which allows all  non-attacking  moves to go first; it can outspeed even Accelgor and  prevent it from  setting up. It can also use Stun Spore to slow down  hazard users, which  allows for a teammate to take them out. However,  Whimsicott is somewhat  frail and is not a very good Pokemon in general,  as it cannot do much  outside of using support moves.</p>
 
<h3><a name="magic_coat">Magic Bounce and Magic Coat</a></h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/177.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Natu</strong><br />
Type: Psychic / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 40 HP / 50 Atk / 45 Def / 70 SpA / 45 SpD / 70 spe<br />
Ability: Synchronize / Early Bird / Magic Bounce</p>

<p>Natu is the only Pokemon in RU with the Magic Bounce  ability, which  reflects certain non-damaging moves, including Stealth  Rock, Spikes, and  Toxic Spikes. However, the one downside to Natu is  that even with  Eviolite, it is extremely frail and weak to common moves  and Pokemon due  to its Psychic / Flying typing and low Speed. Natu has  little use  outside of reflecting hazards, setting up screens, and  using Thunder  Wave. Still, Natu is most effective when paired with a  spinner, as it  increases your chances of keeping hazards off of your  field.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/235.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Smeargle</strong><br />
Type: Normal<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 20 Atk / 35 Def / 20 SpA / 45 SpD / 75 Spe<br />
Ability: Own Tempo / Technician / Moody</p>

<p>While Smeargle is a good hazard user, it can also  prevent hazards with  either of two ways. One is with the move Magic  Coat, with allows  Smeargle to bounce back entry hazards set by faster  leads such as Uxie,  Mesprit, and Aerodactyl. This is also useful when  facing Taunt users,  and it will allow Smeargle to set up its own  hazards without worrying  about being Taunted. The second way that  Smeargle can do well with  hazards is by using Rapid Spin. Rapid Spin  Smeargle is almost never seen  and very unexpected, so it can often  catch the opponent off-guard. Like  Natu, having another spinner on the  same team as Smeargle is a good  idea. Two spinners, such as both  Smeargle and Cryogonal on the same  team, almost always guarantees the  removal of Stealth Rock and Spikes,  which is always appreciated on  every team.</p>

<h2><a name="spinblock">Spinblocking</a></h2>

<p>Spinblocking, which means "to block  Rapid Spin," is the only way to keep  hazards on your field. The way to  do this is by using a Ghost-type;  because Ghost-types are immune to  Normal-type moves, they are immune to  Rapid Spin and can come in on a  spinner to prevent it from ridding the  field of Stealth Rock, Spikes,  or Toxic Spikes. There are many viable  Ghost-types in RU, but some work  better than others. Some beat certain  spinners and are offensively  oriented, while others beat few spinners  and are defensively oriented.</p>

<strong>Spiritomb</strong><br />
Type: Ghost / Dark<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 92 Atk / 108 Def / 92 SpA / 108 Def / 35 Spe<br />
Ability: Pressure / Infiltrator</p>

<p>Spiritomb is among the few Ghost-types that can beat  Cryogonal. With a  Choice Band, it takes advantage of Cryogonal's low  Defense and can KO  with Sucker Punch or trap it with Pursuit. When  dealing with other  spinners, it can use Trick to lock that spinner on a  single move, which  makes it much harder for said spinner to perform  its job. Spiritomb can  also use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physically  attacking spinners, such as  Kabutops, Sandslash, and Hitmonchan.  Overall, Spiritomb is one of the  best spinblockers in the tier.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/484.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Rotom</strong><br />
Type: Electric / Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 50 Atk / 77 Def / 95 SpA / 77 SpD / 91 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Rotom is not that good at spinblocking on its own, so it  is best paired  with another spinblocker. It is extremely frail and  loses to the most  common spinners. However, with Volt Switch and  Will-O-Wisp, Rotom can  either switch to a counter or cripple the  spinner. It can use Pain Split  to heal itself, but other than that, it  gets worn down very easily by  Pokemon such as Cryogonal and Kabutops.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/200.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Misdreavus</strong><br />
Type: Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 60 Atk / 60 Def / 85 SpA / 85 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Misdreavus might not look too good at first, but it is  quite bulky when  holding Eviolite. It also has Levitate, giving it a  very useful immunity  to Ground-type moves. Misdreavus also has a  plethora of support  options, including Heal Bell, Will-O-Wisp, Taunt,  Perish Song, Calm  Mind, and Pain Split. However, it cannot fit all of  these moves onto one  set, so it must choose wisely. Will-O-Wisp and  Pain Split are  recommended, as they will cripple spinners and help  Misdreavus survive  longer, respectively.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/482.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Dusknoir</strong><br />
Type: Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 45 HP / 100 Atk / 135 Def / 65 SpA / 135 SpD / 45 Spe<br />
Ability: Pressure</p>

<p>Dusknoir's niche is that it's the only Ghost-type  besides Spiritomb that  can beat Cryogonal. It has good base 45 / 135 /  135 defenses and a  solid base 100 Attack that allows it to take  advantage of Cryogonal's  horrible Defense stat. It also has Will-O-Wisp  to cripple opposing  spinners. This might sound good, but the lack of  reliable recovery  severely hinders Dusknoir's ability to spinblock  throughout the match.</p>
 
<h2><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
 
 <p>Entry hazards are deadly in RU, so   hopefully you now have an  understanding of how to both use them and   fight against them. If you are  using them, keep in mind that you  should  have sweepers to take  advantage of them, or have moves such as  Roar,  Whirlwind, and Leech Seed  to force switches. While using them,  you  should also make sure to have a  spinblocker or Pokemon that can  deal  with spinners easily, as most  teams in RU are aware of the threat  of  hazards and will usually bring  ways to deal with them. If you are   facing entry hazards, remember not to  play recklessly with your   spinner. Entry hazards can render your  Pokemon useless, so playing   carefully is a must.</p>
