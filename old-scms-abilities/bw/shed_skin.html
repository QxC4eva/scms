<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder has a 1/3 chance of removing its status conditions at the end of each turn. This occurs before burn or poison can damage the wielder.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Shed Skin is a good ability, but only <a href="/bw/pokemon/scrafty">Scrafty</a> is really able to use it well in the upper tiers. Scrafty also has a far superior second ability in <a href="/bw/abilities/moxie">Moxie</a>, but a <a href="/bw/moves/bulk_up">Bulk Up</a> set with Shed Skin and <a href="/bw/moves/rest">Rest</a> is a perfectly viable moveset to use, and Shed Skin can help make status an almost non-issue. Other than that though, no other Pokemon can really use it to its full potential.</p>
