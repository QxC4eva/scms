<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Generally, this team works because it is constantly on the offensive. Between specs Leaf Storms and CB Head Smashes, the opponent just doesn't have any breathing space, and with every attack (except haunter's, but I'll get to that later) being boosted it won't take long to wear him down. A problem is that because it lacks entry hazards, the opponent has an easier time switching, but the only member on the team who learns SR is Aggron who is ~always better off using head smash, while none of the members are easily replacable. It works anyway though so who gives a shit; let's move on to the actual team.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/244.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Entei</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Extremespeed<br />
- Hidden Power Grass<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>Entei's main purposes are punching holes into the opponent's team and picking off fast weakened mons, which is why it pretty much only ever uses flare blitz and extremespeed. It destroys almost every single pokemon in the tier on the switch, and the ones that can survive usually have to recover, giving me a free switch, or can't, making them easy to wear down. Sometimes the team relies on Entei to revenge kill a dangerous threat like Sharpedo though, so it's important to plan its use carefully, as it can die pretty quickly with SR on the field and flare blitz recoil. Not much else to say about Entei since it only really uses two moves.</p>

<p><strong>Haunter</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Trick<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Sludge Bomb</p>

<p>When I added it to the team, Haunter's only purpose was the surprisingly hard task of killing omastar (who otherwise sweeps the team clean if it gets a free turn) and I was annoyed that I had to add a scarfer. However, it turned out to be really good outside of that too. It generally comes in to revenge kill fast threats I can't KO without taking damage myself or to clean in the late game. It can also trick a wall or a set up sweeper if its speed isn't needed in a particular game. Its moveset doesn't have a good coverage or anything, but it's enough to accomplish what I need it to. Giga drain is necessary to OHKO Omastar while sludge bomb allows Haunter to take care of grass types like Sceptile, who this team has a lot of trouble with. Shadow ball is just there to hit stuff like Sigilyph and slowking super effectively if I ever need to, since it doesn't really need anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-C</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Leaf Storm<br />
- Trick<br />
- Volt Switch<br />
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>Rotom is mostly used early in the game to weaken the opponent's team and give free switches to Aggron and Entei or just deal tons of damage with Leaf Storm, depending on the situation. Hp fire is mainly for ferroseed and doesn't come to use very often, while trick is a good option if I want to Volt Switch without having to worry about Ground-types getting free turns. This is important because this team hates SR due to not having any recovery outside of regenerator, so keeping them off the field and pressuing/getting rid of the opponent's SR user is a high priority early in the game, which is something Rotom is perfectly equipped for with volt switch and leaf storm. </p>

<p><strong>Slowking</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Grass Knot<br />
- Surf<br />
- Psyshock</p>

<p>Slowking plays a very important role in this team, taking care of Fire-types like Entei and Moltres as well as pretty much anything that doesn't 2HKO it. It's also hard to OHKO, so it can come in after a KO or a volt switch and beat a ton of shit one on one. What really sets it apart, though, is regenerator, which allows it to function as a wall (within limits) and check strong attackers throughout the game even with a choice item. Grass knot is mostly there to avoid being a completely free switch-in for other Slowking, while fire blast takes care of any Grass-types attempting to switch in. Psyshock is mainly used for jynx, who is a huge threat to this team, and makes Slowking the team's best switch-in to Gallade.</p>

<p><strong>Tangrowth</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Leaf Storm<br />
- Focus Blast</p>

<p>Tangrowth's role is similar to Slowking's, as it's also really bulky and can rely on some recovery in form of regenerator. While Slowking mainly takes care of the special side, Tangrowth's purpose is holding off physical threats such as Feraligatr and Aerodactyl or beating anything that can't KO it one on one. As with every member, its use in a specific game depends heavily on the opponeent's team. If there's nothing important for Tangrowth to check, it's used more offensively and the other way around. Sleep powder might seem odd on a choice specs set, but it's still really useful as it effectively takes out a mon and gives you (and the opponent I guess but whatever) a free switch. Focus blast isn't that useful because Afrobull isn't seen very often and nobody recognizes the excellence of sap sipper Miltank, but I still have it just in case, while hp fire hits other grass types. Tangrowth mostly just uses leaf storm though.</p>

<p><strong>Aggron</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Rock Head<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Heavy Slam<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Head Smash<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>I present you the most amazing pokemon in the gameâ„¢. Aggron generally just doesn't give a shit about anything and kills things with head smash. In case that this isn't possible due obstacles like steelix, it can usually overcome these with one or two correct predictions, and in the rare case that that isn't possible due to something like quagsire blocking the way, there's still the entire team left to put pressure on it. Aggron will almost always get to get a good head smash off eventually, and when it does, something dies. Of course this won't always work that easily, but it still almost guarantees one KO per match, often more. Aside from this, it can force out pretty much everything that can't OHKO it, provide a good switch-in to subroost Honchkrow, take a head smash from another Aggron, destroy leftovers Sigilyph and force out pretty much everything that can't OHKO it. Aggron is amazing.</p>
