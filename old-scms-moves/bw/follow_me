<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All targeted moves used by the foe target the user, regardless of the intended target. This effect is only applicable in double, triple, and multi-battles. This does not affect moves which hit multiple Pokemon, or Pursuit if the intended target switches out. In triple battles, this move only affects moves from adjacent opponents, unless a non-adjacent opponent uses a move that can target non-adjacent Pokemon, such as Air Slash. This move has a priority of +3.</p>

<p>If a Pokemon with the ability Lightningrod and a Pokemon using Follow Me are out at the same time, and a Pokemon uses an Electric attack targeted at the Follow Me user's team, Follow Me will take precedence and absorb the attack. If a Pokemon with the ability Storm Drain and a Pokemon using Follow Me are out at the same time, and a Pokemon uses a Water attack targeted at the Follow Me user's team, Follow Me will take precedence and absorb the attack. Follow Me will take precedence and redirect attacks before Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce take effect.</p>

<p>If both enemies use Follow Me in the same round, moves will target whichever Pokemon used Follow Me second. Follow Me fails if not used in a double or triple battle.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Follow Me is useless in singles. In doubles however, it is extremely useful for giving one Pokemon a free turn, where it cannot be targeted by any of the opposing side's attacks. This allows strategies such as Trick Room to be more easily employed, as well as possibly saving a sweeping teammate from an otherwise fatal attack. Common users of the move include Togekiss and Clefable, both of which sport fantastic bulk, as well as wide movepools.</p>
