<h2>NeverUsed Mini-Tournaments</h2>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3467586">Mini-Tournament 1: Standard BW1</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>DestinyUnknown</strong><br />
Runner-ups: CrashinBoomBang and Zebraiken</p>

The very first Mini-Tournament kept things simple and used the standard metagame at the time, BW1. DestinyUnknown, a player not known for his NeverUsed prowess, eventually managed to prevail over CrashinBoomBang and Zebraiken in the finals, both of whom are experienced and well respected in NeverUsed. Congratulations to DestinyUnknown!</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3468226">Mini-Tournament 2: Round 0 Throwback</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>MMF</strong><br />
Runner-ups: Zebraiken and shnen</p>

Due to popular demand, the second Mini-Tournament returned to everyone's favorite metagame, Round 0! Many Pokemon that now reside in RU were available including but not limited to: Slowking, Klinklang, and Lanturn. The presence of these and other very significant threats makes for a very different metagame, and players had to adapt as best they could. MMF was the eventual winner, prevailing over shnen and previous runner-up Zebraiken.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3469058">Mini-Tournament 3: Standard BW2</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>MMF</strong><br />
Runner-ups: Zebraiken and shnen</p>

The release of BW2 caused much excitement, and what better way to capitalize on that than with a tournament! The standard BW2 metagame was used, with many new toys such as Regenerator Amoonguss and Skill Link Cinccino to use. MMF proved his last win was no fluke by winning again, but Zebraiken and shnen both fell short once more in a repeat of the last tournaments finals. Zebraiken has now lost in all three finals, but is he simply unlucky or prone to choking in important matches? Only time will tell.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3472264">Mini-Tournament 4: Shaking up NU</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>Sweet Jesus</strong><br />
Runner-up: New Breed</p>

This tournament allowed seemingly random Pokemon to be tested in the metagame. At the beginning, Pokemon that were close to dropping were added to the tier, but near the end OU contender Forretress was added to the tier. Sweet Jesus picked up his first Mini-Tournament victory, triumphing over New Breed. Even though Ambipom was allowed for the majority of the tournament, it was not used to success. I guess it does suck in NU!</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3473054">Mini-Tournament 5: fuk hazards</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>CrashinBoomBang</strong><br />
Runner-up: Sweet Jesus</p>

It's arguable that entry hazards are one of the most important things that a team needs to have in order to succeed. This tournament decided to see how the tier would look if Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Stealth Rock were removed from the tier. Unsurprisingly, Pokemon that are only NU because of entry hazards shined, with Articuno and Charizard being key players on many teams. In the finals, an early critical hit gave CrashinBoomBang an early advantage over Sweet Jesus; an advantage that was just too much to overcome with Charizard and Braviary waiting in the wings.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3473486">Mini-Tournament 6: Single Pokemon</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>FireMage</strong><br />
Runner-up: drakon136</p>

In a departure from one of the core rules of 6v6 battling, Mini-Tournament 6 saw players fighting each other using six of the same Pokemon on each team. While seemingly very matchup based, the skill in this form of battling is to build your team in such a way that you can win almost every matchup. This can lead to many creative and unusual sets, as well as generally short matches. The final was contested between FireMage and drakon136, two relatively new users, and FireMage's choice of Cinccino triumphed over drakon136 and Ludicolo. It is also no coincidence that FireMage won, having been taught well by NU tutor Django.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3475879">Mini-Tournament 7: Ice Ice Baby</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>FLCL</strong><br />
Runner-up: DTC</p>

With Snover unbanned from UU and being available for use in all lower tiers, this tournament tried to encourage the use of Snover outside of ladder play. While this standard tournament was made to see how potent hail teams were in NU, many people decided not to use Snover, unfortunately. The final match was a close one between FLCL and DTC, both experienced and well-seasoned NU battlers. DTC caught FLCL off guard with Choice Scarf Tauros, which proved to be a useful revenge killer. Unfortunately for DTC, Tauros barely missed out on a crucial KO, which left FLCL to come out on top in the end.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3477590">Mini-Tournament 8: Proper Counter</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>Valentine</strong><br />
Runner-up: Shining Latios<p>

Everything was standard NU in this tournament, but with a little twist! Before playing, each opponent revealed their Pokemon to each other and were then allowed to change their sets accordingly. From Giga Drain Haunter to Hidden Power Ice Seismitoad to Bounce Sawsbuck (which cost Zebraiken the match), weird sets were being used throughout this entire tournament! The finals consisted of two players, Valentine and Shining Latios, both of whom are not NU regulars. With a lack of thorough understanding of the NU tier, both players decided to stick with their tried-and-true sets instead of trying any funny business. In the end, Valentine took the win with a huge 6-0 using a stall team.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3478295">Mini-Tournament 9: YOLO</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>FLCL</strong><br />
Runner-up: panamaxis</p>

Imagine if Pokemon was like real life â€” where you couldn't recover lost health by using an item, or couldn't walk away to feel better. You could only live once. This held true for this tournament, as all recovery moves, items and abilities were banned. Long gone were Regenerators like Alomomola and Tangela, and rather Sawk, Gorebyss and hyper offense ruled the tournament. Seasoned battlers, FLCL and panamaxis, made it to the finals. Kangaskhan was used by both, however it was FLCL's Samurott that dealt the finishing blow on Kadabra, winning the tournament.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3479474">Mini-Tournament 10: Mechanic Chaos</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>shnen</strong><br />
Runner-up: Novaray</p>

This mini-tour was a back-to-the-future theme, with everything from DPP NU free, along with B2W2 mechanics. With all Generation 5 Pokemon banned, users had to think outside of the box and back to the days of DPP NU. This meant Ninetales and Politoed were both free, however to keep things fair, both the combinations of Drizzle and Swift Swim was banned as well as Chlorophyll and Drought. shnen managed to make it to the finals to face Novaray, and after a close battle in the rain, shnen came out on top and won the tournament. </p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3480674">Mini-Tournament 11: NU Doubles</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>Axaj</strong><br />
Runner-up: Punchshroom</p>

Double or nothing was the basis of this tournament. This tournament played similarly to Smogon Doubles, where two Pokemon were partnered up on each side in order to create unique strategies and matches. During the tournament all sorts of combinations were viable, such as Rage Powder Parasect paired with Shell Smash Gorebyss, as well as Musharna paired with anything that benefited from Trick Room. Punchshroom and Axaj made it to the finals, where after 15 turns of careful playing, Axaj won and was declared the NU Doubles champion.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3482239">Mini-Tournament 12: Standard NU</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>FLCL</strong><br />
Runner-up: Shuckleking87</p>

With Jynx, Munchlax, Primeape and Scolipede recently freed, this mini-tour had no other option but to be Standard NU! Given that people were only just getting a hang of NU's new metagame, everyone was experimenting with different teams. Shuckleking87 and FLCL fought their way through the final, where their newly aquired knowledge of the metagame was put to the test. FLCL got an A grade on the test and ultimately won the tournament. </p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3483153">Mini-Tournament 13: RETURN from the dead</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>FLCL</strong><br />
Runner-up: Agent Dell</p>

This tournament was based around the theme of everything that has ever been NU being free. With everything released there was a lot to prepare for, including favourites like Cinccino and Emboar. FLCL managed to yet again end up in the finals, and defeated Agent Dell to secure a back-to-back mini-tour win. </p>

<h2>NeverUsed Challenges</h2>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3467548">Crisis Core v1</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>CrashinBoomBang</strong><br />
Runner-ups: Django and FLCL<br />
Hosted by Raseri<br />

<strong>Crisis Core</strong> was a challenge unique to NeverUsed, where players are presented with a core of two or three Pokemon by the host, and are tasked with coming up with a core of their own that can counter the hosts. Bonus points are awarded for doing so with a single Pokemon, as well as a number of other more trivial challenges. Participants are also encouraged to disprove their opponents attempts at countering the core, and this led to many heated debates in the thread. CrashinBoomBang was the winner after several weeks of intense competition, just narrowly edging out FLCL and Django due to a wild Skuntank appearing and docking points from all Psychic-type Pokemon used in the final round.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3480632">Crisis Core v2</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>melvni</strong><br />
Runner-ups: Punchshroom and FLCL<br />
Hosted by Sweet Jesus</p>

<strong>Crisis Core</strong> came back for a second time in March 2013. The challenge involved players being presented with a core of two or three Pokemon by the host, and were tasked with coming up with a core of their own that can counter the hosts. Bonus points were awarded for doing so with a single Pokemon, as well as a number of other more trivial challenges. Participants were also encouraged to disprove their opponents attempts at countering the core, and this led to many heated debates in the thread. Throughout the challenge there were many "sac a Pokemon then sweep with second Pokemon" cores, but Sweet Jesus countered that by reducing the amount of points for those cores. Reservations were also a contentious issue, as people started to get annoyed about not being able to post a certain Pokemon because it was reserved. Despite that melvni managed to come out on top and won the second version of the thread.</p>

<strong>Ladder Challenges</strong> was a series of different weekly challenges users had to complete in order to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. These challenges included scrabble, mono-type, randomly generated teams, generation 1-4 Pokemon only and teams where every Pokemon had to have a Choice Scarf, Choice Band or Choice Specs equipped. 

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3481864">NeverUsed Premier League</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>Blackthorn Braviarys</strong><br />
Runner-ups: Sootopolis Samurotts<br />
Hosted by FireMage<br />

The <strong>NeverUsed Premier League</strong> was a tournament hosted by FireMage where everyone who signed up was put into six teams. It was the first of its kind outside of Smogon Premier League, and the other tiers followed afterwards. The teams were the Blackthorn Braviarys, managed by FLCL; the Canalave Camerupts, managed by Zebraiken and Honus; the Dewford Dewgongs, managed by Raseri; the Lilycove Ludicolos, managed by CrashinBoomBang; the Sootopolis Samurotts, managed by Annoyer and the Safari Zone Sawsbucks, managed by Django. Over the course of five weeks each team played off against each other and won points for each victory, similar to how the Smogon Premier League works. Eventually the Sootopolis Samurotts made it to the finals with the Blackthorn Braviarys. The Braviarys managed to defeat the Samurotts and were declared champions of the first ever NU Premier League.

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3467167">#NeverUsed Showdown</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>FLCL</strong><br />
Runner-ups: Raseri, MMF, and Zebraiken<br />
Hosted by Django</p>

Another event unique to NeverUsed, the <strong>#Neverused Showdown</strong> was a series of live tournaments held in the #Neverused IRC channel. Each tournament had a twist however, such as banning the top 20 most used Pokemon in NeverUsed. This forced players to think on their feet and build a new team to adapt to the rulset in the 20 minute time limit. Points are awarded depending on the players performance in the tournament, and after a month of competition and 22 live tournaments, FLCL ran away with the competition and won with 29 points. His nearest rival was Raseri on 20 points followed by MMF and Zebraiken on 15.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3469132">NUgget Bridge v1</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>FLCL</strong><br />
Runner-up: shnen<br />
Hosted by Django</p>

The <strong>NUgget Bridge</strong> was a pioneer of sorts, spawning similar challenges across many other metagame forums, and sparking activity in each one. The idea was as simple as the Nugget Bridge itself, beat five trainers in order and win a prize! Five of the best (or worst in Keiran's case) were chosen to defend the bridge against challengers, who were aiming to become the Team Rocket member at the head of the bridge and hold that position for the longest amount of time. shnen reached the end first, but couldn't stand up to FLCL who followed up his success in the #Neverused Showdown with victory here.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3482523">NUgget Bridge v2</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>FLCL</strong><br />
Hosted by Cherub Agent</p>

FLCL was not only a Bug Catcher, but he also became the champion of the NUgget Bridge once again. He fought his way through players that were skilled at johning, such as EBeast and managed to become the Team Rocket member this time around, claiming his champion title back. </p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3467584">NU Ladder Racing</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>FLCL</strong><br />
Runner-up: Raseri<br />
Hosted by Steamroll</p>

The Ladder Race was just what its name suggests, a race to the top of the ladder. Players signed up with fresh alts and then spent every waking moment climbing the ladder. It took FLCL just 3 days to reach the very top (where 3 of his other alts already were...) to cement his reputation as the most consistent and dedicated ladder player.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3478921">The Dark Horse Challenge</a></h3>
<strong>The Dark Horse Challenge</strong> was a challenge based around using the lesser-used Pokemon while laddering. The Pokemon that qualified as "Dark Horse" Pokemon were those with 3.41% usage or less on the NU ladder. S-Ranked Pokemon were banned, and you could only have a few A-rank Pokemon, according to the Viability Rankings. This meant players had to get creative with their teams in order to be good enough to get into the Hall of Fame.

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3469250">The NUlympics</a></h3>

<p>Winner: <strong>Incon</strong><br />
Runners-up: CrashinBoomBang<br />
Hosted by Keiran</p>

<p>The NUlympics were a series of 4 mini-tournaments. Each tournament had a different theme, such as Monotype or Triples. Like the Olympics, you received medals when you won; a gold medal gave you three points, silver medal two, and bronze medal one. At the end of the 4 mini-tournaments, the points were added up and Incon was crowned NUlympics champion, with CrashinBoomBang coming in 2nd, and shnen and DTC tying for 3rd.</p>

<h3><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3471423">The NeverUsed Sweet Potato Award</a></h3>

<p>The Sweet Potato Award is an adaptation of a certain OU award with a similar name, in which posters in the NeverUsed sub forum are rewarded for making intelligent and insightful posts. Every week or so (the time period can vary) a user who has made a significant number of high quality posts is selected by the moderation staff and award the Sweet Potato for their efforts. Winning this award is a stepping stone to pretty pixels in your postbit (badges) and winning it multiple times will perhaps even lead to a badge itself.</p>
