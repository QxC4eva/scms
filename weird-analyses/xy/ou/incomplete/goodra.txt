    Assault Vest Tank
    ########
    name: Assault Vest Tank
    move 1: Draco Meteor
    move 2: Fire Blast
    move 3: Thunderbolt / Sludge Bomb
    move 4: Dragon Tail
    ability: Sap Sipper / Gooey
    item: Assault Vest
    nature: Quiet / Sassy
    evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD

    Moves
    ========
    - draco meteor is goodra's strongest attack and allows it to do a lot of damage while taking very little.
    - for example, with the given set, Goodra can take any offensive OU Dragon's Draco Meteor while OHKOing at the same time (with the exception of defensive Latias, Zygarde, and opposing Goodra):
    252 SpA Choice Specs Latios Draco Meteor vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Assault Vest Goodra: 300-354 (78.1 - 92.1%) -- guaranteed 2HKO
    252 SpA Choice Specs Latios Draco Meteor vs. 252 HP / 4+ SpD Assault Vest Goodra: 270-320 (70.3 - 83.3%) -- guaranteed 2HKO

    - fire blast hits ferrothorn, klefki, other steels, etc. anything weak to fire
    - thunderbolt will hit azumarill and anything weak to electric.
    - together, fire blast and tbolt will hit any fairy you might need to attack, making sludge bomb unnecessary.
    - sludge bomb does have good utility though, with it's 30% chance to poison while still hitting fairies.
    - dragon tail helps phaze and provide good team support, especially with hazards up.
    - since heatran completely walls this set, Earthquake is also an option to use in Dragon Tail's spot.

    Set Details
    ========
    - maxing spA lets goodra really function as a tank by being able to dish out a ton of damage
    - quiet nature reinforces that, while sassy allows it to take less damage. 252 SpA from base 110 still hits pretty hard
    - 248 evs for stealth rock

    - sap sipper gives goodra an immunity, which is extremely welcome on a pokemon with no recovery, allowing it to come in virtually unscathed on a predicted grass attack. it's also immune to spore and other grass type status moves because of this!

    - on the other hand, gooey is also quite useful to potentially turn the tide of the battle to your favor.
    - sap sipper is preferred because goodra does not like taking physical hits, and most contact hits (with the exception of 2 rarely used moves and grass knot) are physical. if goodra is taking physical hits, you're in a bad position anyway.
    - that said, it can be helpful to switch in on random resisted contact hits or as a last-ditch effort to stop an opponent's sweep.

    - assault vest makes the set but leftovers is also an option

    Usage Tips
    ========
    - well suited for an offensive team
    - dragon tail is a nice move to spam to rack up hazard damage especially since goodra can take most hits. some pokemon might goodra as set-up fodder, making dragon tail an especially useful move.


    Team Options
    ========
    - likes to switch in and out a lot, especially thanks to draco meteor so teammates who can Rapid Spin or Defog are much appreciated
    - wish support is also useful because of goodra's lack of any recovery whatsoever
    - type-wise, goodra has good synergy with heatran, who resists both of Goodra's weaknesses and together form a solid special defensive core.
    - scizor also works with goodra as a physical defensive partner who resists ice and fairy
    - similarly, goodra enjoys teammates who can burn potential physical threats. for this reason, rotom-w pairs well with goodra.
    - rotom-w sole grass weakness is covered by goodra (especially sap sipper versions) while rotom-w covers goodra's ice weakness.
    - rotom-w also helps with goodra's tendency to be hit with non-contact physical moves from


    Specs
    ########
    name: All-Out Offense
    move 1: Draco Meteor
    move 2: Fire Blast
    move 3: Thunderbolt
    move 4: Focus Blast
    ability: Gooey / Sap Sipper
    item: Choice Specs
    nature: Modest
    evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD

    Moves
    ========
    - given moveset are Goodra's best coverage moves
    - Draco Meteor off of boosted 110 base Special Attack hits HARD.
    - Fire Blast and Thunderbolt together hit most fairies but Sludge Wave is also an option over either to hit certain targets.

    Set Details
    ========
    - 248 EVs give Goodra's maximum odd HP to avoid the odd scenario where Goodra could die just by switching into hazards a number of times.

    - since this Goodra does not carry a physical move, Gooey is preferred over Sap Sipper but Sap Sipper's ability to make Goodra immune to Grass (and thereby, most sleep moves) is still very useful.

    - choice specs is necessary in order for goodra to hit as hard as it can.

    Usage Tips
    ========
    - while the AV set can usually hang around and take some hits while dishing a fair amount of damage, the specs set prefers to switch in and out a lot more, while dealing a lot of damage in the process.
    - ideally, switch in on a resisted hit and then hit back with an extremely strong specs-boosted attack

    Team Options
    ========
    - specs goodra works well on an offensively minded or bulky offense team
    - for this reason, heatran and rotom-w are both good teammates for specs goodra
    - other teammates that can work include rotom-h
    - genesect can also work extremely well: if genesect uses a fast u-turn on something that normally carries a fire-type attack, it can switch straight to goodra who resists and can deal huge damage the next turn. rotom-w can do the same thing, expecting a grass-type attack which goodra resists or is immune to.



    Specially Defensive
    ########
    name: Specially Defensive
    move 1: Dragon Pulse
    move 2: Flamethrower
    move 3: Thunderbolt
    move 4: Toxic / Dragon Tail
    ability: Sap Sipper / Gooey
    item: Leftovers
    nature: Calm / Sassy
    evs: 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 SpD

    Moves
    ========
    - this set is built more for stallish teams and as such has a moveset to correspond
    - dragon pulse deals more consistent damage than draco meteor
    - flamethrower and thunderbolt provide coverage
    - the last moveslot depends on your team:
    - toxic is the more versatile option to badly poison opponents, but
    - if your team is heavy on hazards, dragon tail may be the better option to deal passive damage
    - if you go with toxic, earthquake is also an option over thunderbolt to hit non-levitating poison types who are immune to toxic.

    Set Details
    ========
    - for this set, sap sipper gives a slight benefit thanks to the extra immunity which can be invaluable on a stall team.
    - gooey is also a fine option, however, since stall teams are generally slow, the speed drop may not be beneficial.
    - if you do have a few slightly speedy pokemon that can take advantage of gooey, feel free to go with gooey over sap sipper.
    - leftovers is unfortunately Goodra's most reliable form of recovery
    - the evs emphasize goodra's special bulk. use calm with toxic and sassy with dragon tail and/or earthquake
    - for a more balanced defensive spread, try the following: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a Bold (with toxic) or Relaxed (with dragon tail/earthquake) nature.

    Usage Tips
    ========
    - as mentioned before, this set generally performs better on more defensive teams that rely more on passive damage through status and hazards than direct damage.
    - thanks to goodra's immense special bulk and useful resistances, it can hold its own against special threats while spreading status and/or hazard damage.
    Team Options
    ========
    - without any reliable recovery outside of leftovers, goodra very much enjoys wish support. clefable is a good choice thanks to its fairy typing giving it a safe switch in to dragon-type attacks directed at goodra.
    - useful teammates on stall teams include: mandibuzz, skarmory, chansey, gliscor, rotom-w
