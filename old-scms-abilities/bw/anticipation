<p>Alerts the wielder to certain dangerous moves.</p>

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On switch-in, the wielder shudders if any foe has a super effective or OHKO move. It does not alert the wielder to OHKO moves that cannot hit it. <a href="/bw/moves/counter">Counter</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/metal_burst">Metal Burst</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/mirror_coat">Mirror Coat</a> count as attacking moves of their respective types, while <a href="/bw/moves/bide">Bide</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/hidden_power">Hidden Power</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/judgment">Judgment</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/natural_gift">Natural Gift</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/techno_blast">Techno Blast</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/weather_ball">Weather Ball</a> are considered Normal-type moves. Anticipation will immediately activate whenever the ability is acquired, such as through <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Anticipation is mediocre competitively and in-game. Unlike most other competitively useless abilities, it doesn't have an in-game benefit. <a href="/bw/pokemon/toxicroak">Toxicroak</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/whiscash">Whiscash</a> have better abilities, even though in Whiscash's case, <a href="/bw/abilities/oblivious">Oblivious</a> is still pretty useless. It is <a href="/bw/pokemon/wormadam">Wormadam</a>'s only non-Dream World ability, but Wormadam shouldn't ever be used regardless. With OHKO moves being banned in standard play, half of Anticipation's purpose is removed. It doesn't distinguish the individual moves themselves, so it provides little information anyway.</p>
