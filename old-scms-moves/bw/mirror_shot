<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to lower the target's accuracy by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Mirror Shot has little competitive use. It is weak compared other special Steel-type attacks, has poor accuracy, and to top it all off, Steel is a bad offensive typing anyway. The chance to lower accuracy is also not a significant perk, as relying on lowering the opponent's accuracy is an unreliable tactic.</p>
