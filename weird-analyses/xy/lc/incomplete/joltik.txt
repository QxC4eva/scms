Doesn’t learn Sticky Web
Great offensive dual STAB
Speedy Volt Switch user
Only two weaknesses, Fire and Rock
Being resistant to common priority such as Mach Punch and Bullet Punch is always a plus
Hits 16 SpA, which is decent, but doesn't hit hard enough sometimes
No offense boosting moves outside of Charge Beam

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Bug Buzz
move 3: Volt Switch
move 4: Energy Ball
ability: Swarm
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 36 HP / 220 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========
Thunderbolt is the Electric STAB move of choice
Bug Buzz is Joltik’s other STAB, which hits the Grass-types that resist Thunderbolt. Since it’s a sound-based move, it also has the cool effect of hitting through Substitute.
A speedy Volt Switch is great for scouting
Energy Ball is important for hitting Ground-types and Chinchou, who may switch in predicting a Volt Switch

Set Details
========
A Modest nature is preferred for maximum damage output. Joltik hits 24 speed with 236 Speed EVs and a neutral nature. However, Timid can be used to ensure you outspeed threats such as +2 Jolly Tirtouga.
The chosen ability is Swarm because it lacks good moves to take advantage of Compound Eyes (doesn't learn Thunder), and Unnerve is very situational since it doesn’t prevent Berry Juice consumption. Swarm at least has the chance to power up Bug Buzz.

Usage Tips
========
Be careful with Volt Switch if you see any Ground-types or Chinchou in the team preview.
Use Joltik to scout early in the game, then bring it in for revenge killing as needed throughout the game.
It can switch into resisted hits, just make sure you’re certain which move its coming in on since strong neutral hits can take it out.
Team Options
========
Joltik works best in a VoltTurn core to keep momentum flowing and to keep the opponent guessing
Mienfoo makes a great VoltTurn partner thanks to its resistance to Rock and its ability to hit special walls on their weaker physical side. Mienfoo also can do hefty damage to Magnemite and Munchlax, two mons who have no problem walling Joltik.
Archen and Larvesta can also form a VoltTurn core with Joltik, however they all share a Rock-type weakness, so their synergy isn’t as good.
Rapid Spin/Defog users are almost mandatory since it’s Stealth Rock weak and it does a lot of switching in and out.


Substitute + 3 Attacks
########
name: Substitute + 3 Attacks
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Bug Buzz
move 4: Giga Drain / Energy Ball
ability: Swarm
item: Life Orb / Berry Juice
evs: 36 HP / 220 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========
Substitute provides Joltik with a nice cushion against priority and powerful attacks
Thunderbolt and Bug Buzz are Joltik’s obligatory STAB moves
Giga Drain is great in the final slot to heal back HP lost from Substitute and Life Orb
Energy Ball is a stronger option

Set Details
========
Life Orb provides this set with more power than the Choice Scarf set
Berry Juice can also be used, which gives Joltik more longevity and works well alongside Substitute
Timid nature allows Joltik to hit 17 speed, allowing it to outspeed Meditite, Chinchou, and Fletchling, among many others
Usage Tips
========
Try to set up Substitute on foes when they predict a Volt Switch. This allows you to get a free Giga Drain off on the switch in.

Team Options
========
Entry hazard removal is still much appreciated, so Rapin Spin/Defog users make great teammates
Joltik has trouble getting past specially bulky mons, so teammates with high physical attack help out a lot


Other Options
########
Joltik can run an Agility set with Life Orb, boosting its speed to 32 with a Modest nature or 34 with a Timid Nature.
A bulky set with Eviolite/Berry Juice, Discharge, Thunder Wave, etc… is usable (not sure what the best spread for that would be)
Charge Beam is Joltik's only way to boost SpA, but it's unreliable
It has Sucker Punch for priority, but lack of STAB and low attack means it won’t be doing any significant damage.
It gets plenty of other physical moves such as Wild Charge, X-Scissor, and Poison Jab, but Joltik’s attack is too low to effectively pull off a physical/mixed set.


Checks & Counters
########
Munchlax stands out as the best counter since it can sponge any attack Joltik throws at it, and can deal heavy damage with Body Slam or OHKO it with Fire Punch
Magnemite resists all of Joltik’s commonly used moves
Pokemon with lots of special bulk in general will be able to come in on Joltik with few issues, since Joltik isn’t overwhelmingly powerful
Joltik struggles against strong priority users such as Pawniard, who can take away around 80% of its health with Sucker Punch
Faster Choice Scarf users are another way to check Joltik
