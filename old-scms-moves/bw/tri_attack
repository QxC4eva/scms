<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 20% chance to burn, freeze, or paralyze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Tri Attack is not distributed very widely. The only viable users of this move are the Porygon evolutionary line and Togekiss. Porygon-Z is the best user of Tri Attack, as the STAB bonus is doubled with Adaptability, bringing its 80 Base Power to a sky-high 160. Togekiss can use it with its base 120 Special Attack and Serene Grace for a reasonable chance of inflicting status; however, Togekiss typically only has room for one STAB move, and Air Slash is usually chosen instead for its flinching chance.<p>
