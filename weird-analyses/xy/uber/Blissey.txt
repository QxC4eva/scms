Overview
########

- In Ubers Blissey is more viable than Chansey because of her ability to hold Shed Shell and in turn prevent from being trapped by Mega Gengar. Her smaller weakness to Knock Off, and ability to be slightly less predictable are also reasons to run Blissey over Chansey.

Pros:
- Single best base HP stat of any Pokemon (255)
- Very strong base special defense (135)
- Has an immunity to ghost types
- Has a single weakness

Cons:
- Intolerable base 10 defense
- Has no resistances
- Mega Gengar is a common threat in Ubers and counters Blissey unless she runs Shed Shell

Moves
========

- Toxic takes down the special attackers which Blissey walls so long as they don't have Rest
- Seismic Toss deals reliable damage to any foe that is not a ghost-type
- Flamethrower hits Ferrothorn and Scizor hard on the switch and can take down most Mega Gengar; it should be primarily run with Leftovers
- Soft-Boiled gives Blissey reliable and instant recovery
- Wish can be used to pass lumps of 325 HP to teammates; usually a full recovery
- Heal Bell offers much support and takes Toxic Spikes damage off Blissey.
- Protect can be run to stall for Toxic damage, lock choice users, and wait for Wish


Set Details
========

- Blissey already has incredible base HP so 252 investment in defenses is more logical
- Typically Calm should be run since Bold Blissey cannot take physical hits well and boosting a base 10 instead of a base 135 is not optimal
- Shed Shell allows Blissey to escape from Mega Gengar and other trappers to switch into Pursuit users or other counters
- Leftovers can be run to give Blissey a better chance at walling very powerful special attackers such as Kyogre, but this leaves her as fodder for trappers. If Flamethrower is run in conjunction this allows her to beat a typical Mega Gengar


Usage Tips
========

- Tank powerful special hits, but don't switch into Choice Specs Kyogre
- Take advantage of predictable switch-ins that attempt to counter Blissey
- Heal allies when your opponent's momentum is broken
- Watch out for mixed attackers
- Once she has fulfilled her duties don't be afraid to sacrifice Blissey to get Wish recovery on a powerful sweeper or tank


Team Options
========

- Partners that check Blissey's weakness to fighting such as Fairy Arceus, Ghost Arceus, and Giratina-A
- Partners such as Rock Arceus that check Blissey's common threats to Ho-Oh and Yveltal while benefiting from Blissey's check to Kyogre
- Physical walls that absorb physical damage with no problem such as Gliscor, Ferrothorn, Giratina-A, etc.
- Defensive stall team members that can threaten Mewtwo variants such as Physically Defensive Kyogre, Ghost Arceus, Aegislash, Jirachi, etc.
- Set up sweepers that depend on being free of status such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Geomancy Xerneas, etc.
- Revenge killers that become useless when paralyzed or burned such as Choice Scarf users.
- U-Turn users that can switch into predicted Taunts from foes such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Areodactyl while being advantageous to a defensively oriented team.
- Ditto to counter a majority of set up sweepers that boost right in Blissey's face such as basically any Swords Dance or Dragon Dance set. Also Geomancy Xerneas


Other Options
========

- Thunder Wave can cripple sweepers and revenge killers to in turn make sweeping easier for allies, although Toxic is often sorely missed
- Snatch can be run to counter Calm Mind sets and can also steal attempts to eliminate Toxic status
- Ice Beam can hit powerful physical threats such as Rayquaza, Landorus, and Gliscor on the switch however Blissey suffers greatly from loosing a move slot
- Fire Blast can hit Scizor, Skarmory and Ferrothorn harder than Flamethrower but it is less reliable. Again loosing a move slot is painful
- Stealth Rock can be run on Blissey, and while this can prevent an offensive set from being ruined on another teammate this is a waste of a move on Blissey for most teams. Since Blissey often forces a switch this turn can be used to set up rocks
