<h2>Battling</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Best OU Battler</dt>
<dt>Best UU Battler</dt>
<dt>Best Ubers Battler</dt>
<dt>Best RU Battler</dt>
<dt>Best NU Battler</dt>
<dt>Best VGC Battler</dt>
<dt>Best Little Cup Battler</dt>
<dd>These categories recognizes the elite players of Smogon's respective metagames, those who have risen above the rest in 2011.</dd>

<dt>Best Tournament Player</dt>
<dd>This category is for consistent, successful tournament players. To be a great tournament player, you need to be a good team-builder, skilled at adapting to a variety of environments, and a keen strategist.</dd>

<dt>Best Ladder Player</dt>
<dd>This category is for the players you always see high on the ladder. To be a great ladder player, your teams need to cover an extremely wide array of threats, you need to be good at rematches, and you need dedication.</dd>

<dt>Best Team Builder</dt>
<dd>This category is for the players who make the best teams, solid teams that handle a lot of threats and have effective game plans.</dd>

<dt>Best Old-School Player</dt>
<dd>This category is for the best at old generations <strong>during 2011</strong>: RBY, GSC, and ADV. There have been a number of old-gen tournaments in 2011, such as the Smogon Premier League, (You Can Not) Advance, and the old-gen mashup, in which old players have some to defend their titles, and some new players have proved their competence.</dd>

<dt>Most Influential Player</dt>
<dd>The Most Influential Player is a trendsetter. Think of someone whose teams and strategies shaped part of a metagame in 2011. An example from past years is obi, whose stall team was ubiquitous in DP.</dd>

<dt>Most Gimmicky Player</dt>
<dd>Think of this as a tongue-in-cheek creativity award. Picture a player who constantly employs innovative, unique strategies and is willing to try pretty much anything.</dd>

<dt>Biggest Upset</dt>
<dd>In 2011, there have been a few shocking and noteworthy moments in competitive Pokémon. A 2009 example was Oceania winning the World Cup. This category is for triumphant underdogs and dark horses.</dd>

<dt>Luckiest Player</dt>
<dd>Battling this player makes Jirachi's Iron Heads look tame.</dd>

<dt>Most Intimidating Player</dt>
<dd>Smogon is host to a whole legion of fantastic Pokemon battlers. However, there is always that one battler who, when their name pops up against you on the ladder, makes your heart sink with their amazing reputation. Sometimes they live up to it and sometimes they don't, but one thing is for certain: people fear this name.</dd>

<dt>Best Overall Player</dt>
<dd>The best Smogon player in 2011.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Users</h2>

<dt>Most Improved User</dt>
<dd>This user started out terrible, and now they're not. Or maybe it wasn't that bad, but either way, there are a lot of people who could take a leaf from the Most Improved User's book. From cringeworthy people to good users, the Most Improved User award recognizes the effort that goes into reforming your behaviour.</dd>

<dd>This user isn't necessarily new, but their contributions have made them recognized everywhere in 2011. Perhaps they're new to contributing in various facets of the site, or perhaps they've only just now been recognized. These are the rising stars of Smogon 2011.</dd>

<dt>Best Avatar</dt>
<dt>Best Signature</dt>
<dt>Best Custom Title</dt>
<dd>Some people express themselves extremely creatively in their avatar, signatures, and/or custom titles. For your nomination to count, you must name the user and what it is. For an example of an avatar from last year: Mekkah's <em>Animals</em> pun avatar. Make sure it's clear so we know what you're referring to so we can count your vote! 'Um... you know that avatar with the cool effects and the Squirtle?' won't cut it.</dd>
