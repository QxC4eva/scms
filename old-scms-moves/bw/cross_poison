[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to poison the target. Has a critical hit rate one stage higher than normal. Assuming there are no other critical hit modifiers in play, this move has a 1/8 chance to get a critical hit instead of a 1/16 chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Cross Poison is a decent physical STAB move for any Poison-type that has access to it. Even though Poison isn't a great offensive type on it's own, it still hits a lot of things for at least neutral damage and can be paired with a coverage move with great success. The best user is definitely Drapion, thanks to usable Attack and Speed stats, good typing, and access to Sniper, an ability that lets him abuse the increased critical hit chance. However, the low Base Power can be a great letdown, so you may want to opt for a more powerful STAB move.</p>
