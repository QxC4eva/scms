Overview
########

Omastar has one thing that allows it to separate itself from other potent rain sweepers: its access to Shell Smash, one of the best setup moves in the game. If you take into account its decent base 115 Special Attack, Omastar is able to function as an extremely deadly sweeper that can tear teams apart even without weather support. It also has a great base 125 Defense and great typing in conjunction with Weak Armor, which allows Omastar to switch in on many physical hits and get a free boost in Speed. Omastar differs slightly from Gorebyss, another Shell Smash user, due to its Rock typing, allowing it to resist Normal- and Flying-type attacks, particularly those of Talonflame, a big threat in the current metagame.

Though Omastar can be extremely deadly, it does have many noticeable flaws that prevent it from being used more often. The most obvious flaw is that Omastar is extremely slow, and can be outsped by common Choice Scarf users even at +2 Speed. Omastar also has a massive x4 weakness to Grass, as well as other common weaknesses to types such as Fighting, Ground, and Electric. Its movepool is also extremely limited, though it still gets very good coverage with Hydro Pump and Ice Beam. It is also weak to the common priority moves Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. Finally, the lack of permanent rain and sand hampered Omastar's utility in OU as it really loves the power or defense boosts either weather provides.

Moves
========

Shell Smash is the most important move on what is Omastar's only viable set, as it allows Omastar to become an immediate threat in just one turn. Surf is Omastar's most reliable STAB attack, but it will lose out on KOs that Hydro Pump can net on sturdy tanks such as Mega Aggron. Ice Beam is a great coverage move to hit not only the Grass-types that resist Omastar's STAB but also to seriously damage or KO the many Dragon-types roaming around the tier, such as Dragonite and Garchomp. Finally, Hidden Power Grass is an essential move to have if Omastar wishes to hit opposing Water-types.

Set Details
========

While a Timid nature allows Omastar to outspeed neutral base 100 Speed Choice Scarf users, a Modest nature is preferred for the extra power. As for item choice, a White Herb allows Omastar to keep its defenses after one turn of setup, which is ideal for a mid- to late-game sweep, as Omastar is still rather slow. However, a Lum Berry will prevent Omastar from being paralyzed or crippled by other status; this is useful for preventing a Thunder Wave from Thundurus or Blissey stopping your sweep cold.

Usage Tips
========

Shell Smash Omastar can be a serious threat if used right, but it usually has only one shot at pulling off a successful sweep, so make sure that its checks and counters are either eliminated or seriously weakened before bringing it in. These threats include naturally fast Pokemon, Choice Scarf users, and special walls. When bringing Omastar in, Weak Armor variants can gain a free Speed boost from taking physical hits, so switching it in on resisted physical moves will give Omastar a slight edge. One of the most common threats in the metagame, Talonflame, is also incredibly easy to set up on, as Omastar 4x resists its Flare Blitz. However, keep in mind that Choice Band Talonflame can 2HKO Omastar with a priority Brave Bird. Finally, if Omastar is brought in a little early, it can try to use an attack instead of setting up to damage a check on the switch and then immediately switch out, but this is quite a risky tactic.

Team Options
========

A Fire-type teammate such as Heatran or Charizard is extremely useful for getting rid of Ferrothorn, which completely counters Omastar, though any teammate with a Fire-type move will also suffice. An entry hazard setter is useful for any sweeper to turn quite a few 2HKOs into OHKOs, and Omastar is no exception. Omastar has lots of trouble with special walls, so having a strong physical attacker like Talonflame is useful for getting rid of them. Talonflame is also able to get rid of Mega Venusaur, which is arguably Omastar's best and most common counter, with Brave Bird. Many top-tier special walls, such as Blissey, Chansey, and Tyranitar, are weak to Fighting-type moves, so having a Fighting-type in your team, such as Conkeldurr or Breloom will greatly help Omastar pull off a successful sweep. Finally, if using Swift Swim, be sure to have Politoed or a Rain Dance user to take advantage of it, as there are lots of Pokemon that Omastar can't outspeed without it.

Other Options
########

Unfortunately, Omastar doesn't have many other options that it can fall back on. It does have access to all forms of entry hazards, so you could use it as a defensive or suicide Spiker, though it is generally outclassed by those with more bulk or more Speed, such as Forretress and Skarmory.

Checks & Counters
########

**Choice Scarf Users**: Omastar is quite slow, so Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp can outspeed it even when it's at +2 Speed and KO it with a powerful attack.

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Chansey and Blissey, as well as tanks such as Assault Vest Goodra or Snorlax, can take Omastar's hits with relative ease and can either cripple or outright KO it.

**Priority Users**: Omastar is weak to a few common priority attacks; Mach Punch from Conkeldurr or Technician Breloom will easily take it out.

**Grass-types**: Although Omastar has Ice Beam to handle most Grass-types, there are a few that it just can't deal with. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn both take neutral damage against Ice-type attacks thanks to Thick Fat and Steel typing, respectively. Both Pokemon also have 4x super effective STAB Grass-type moves to take Omastar down with ease.

**Water-types**: Due to the nerf on Hidden Power this generation, Omastar has a much harder time dealing with opposing Water-types. Gyarados takes neutral damage Grass-type attacks, and its bulky variants essentially counter Omastar, especially if it has Earthquake. Rotom-W is also a bulky Water-type that can take advantage of its STAB Electric-type moves to take down Omastar.
