<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of +2.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>ExtremeSpeed is a great move, and those that get it should count themselves lucky. Because it entirely bypasses Speed, Pokemon can use this move to defeat revenge killers. Rayquaza, Dragonite, Lucario, and Arceus are especially great with this move, as each of them can boost their Attack to make ExtremeSpeed hit harder, and so take out potential revenge killers without a scratch; Normal Arceus even receives STAB on ExtremeSpeed. However, ExtremeSpeed's low PP makes it prone to being stalled out, particularly in the Ubers environment, so be wary of spamming this move.</p>
