Summons permanent rain.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Causes rain weather upon entering the battlefield. Instead of lasting 5 turns, it lasts the entire match, unless another weather is activated. If two weather inducers are sent out at the same time, the slower of the two will have their weather set up over the faster one. If rain weather was already induced via <a href="/bw/moves/rain_dance">Rain Dance</a>, sending out a Pokemon with Drizzle will make rain indefinite. Drizzle will immediately activate whenever the ability is acquired, such as through <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Drizzle is one of the biggest factors in any metagame it is allowed in, thanks to its permanent rain effect. It supports many Pokemon with its multitude of effects. Many Electric-type Pokemon can now comfortably run <a href="/bw/moves/thunder">Thunder</a> over <a href="/bw/moves/thunderbolt">Thunderbolt</a>, while the few Pokemon who have <a href="/bw/moves/hurricane">Hurricane</a> can utilize a perfect accuracy 120 Base Power attack with great neutral coverage. Pokemon who are weak to Fire-type attacks can remove their weakness with the rain, while Water-type Pokemon can use their double-STAB Water-type attacks to destroy the opponents team. In OU, <a href="/bw/pokemon/politoed">Politoed</a> is transformed from a poor excuse for a Water-type into a powerful attacker; in Ubers, <a href="/bw/pokemon/kyogre">Kyogre</a> becomes nigh on uncounterable. In OU however, Drizzle cannot be used with Pokemon who use <a href="/bw/abilities/swift_swim">Swift Swim</a>, such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/kabutops">Kabutops</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/kingdra">Kingdra</a>, meaning people who want to use such a strategy must use the move Rain Dance instead. Such restrictions do not exist in Ubers.</p>
