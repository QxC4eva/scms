<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Puts the target to sleep. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Pokemon with the abilities Insomnia or Vital Spirit are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Lovely Kiss is rarely seen, as it has extremely low distribution. On Pokemon that do learn it, such as Jynx, Lovely Kiss is a somewhat reliable method of inducing sleep.</p>
