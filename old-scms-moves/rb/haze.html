Eliminates all stat changes.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Brings all Pokémon's stat changes to their base amount (0 stages). Will remove Reflect and Light Screen from both Pokémon and will remove any status changes on the opponent.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While Haze is one of the most effective ways to remove stat boosts, it has bad distribution and it will be detrimental if the user has stat boosts itself. It will also cure opponent's status, including thawing from freeze, so it must be used with absolute care. It's thus not usually seen in use.</p>
