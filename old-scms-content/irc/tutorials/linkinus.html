<p>Linkinus is a powerful IRC client for OSX. It's not free, but it is very powerful and has a large amount of features.</p>

<h2>Downloading</h2>

<p>Linkinus can be downloaded from the Mac App Store <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/linkinus/id402390998?mt=12">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Setting Linkinus Up</h2>

<p>When you open up Linkinus for the first time, you will get a window like this:</p>

<p><img src="/irc/linkinus_startup.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Click on the plus in the bottom left corner. </p>

<p><img src="/irc/linkinus_networks.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The network you need to connect to, SynIRC, isn't listed by default, so you'll need to add it manually by clicking on the new network button on the bottom left corner.</p>

<p>Click on the plus on the bottom left to add a new connection. For the network name, you'll use SynIRC, and for the server hostname, you use <kbd>irc.synirc.net</kbd>.</p>

<p>This will bring you to the Linkinus welcome screen.</p>

<h2>Personalizing Linkinus</h2>

<p>To set up Linkinus to automatically identify you, you want to click Linkinus in the top left corner of your screen, and open up Preferences and click Identities under Data Control.</p>
