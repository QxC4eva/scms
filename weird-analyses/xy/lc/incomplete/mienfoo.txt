Overview
########
Once at the top of the metagame, Mienfoo remains an excellent bulky offensive pivot in this metagame. It can support the team through the newly buffed Knock Off, and remain healthy throughout the match with the nigh-exclusive combination of U-turn + Regenerator. It has the ability check prevalent Pokemon such as Tirtouga, Carvanha, and Pawniard, beating them through its powerful Fighting-type STAB, and decent Eviolite boosted bulk.

However, its typing leaves it walled by Fairies, Ghost-types, and beaten out by common Flying-types. It also despises status, with Burn lowering its damage output and delivering chip damage and Paralyze eliminating its speed advantage. It receives competition from Timburr as a bulky pivot, who takes advantage of status through Guts and has better bulk. Meditite competes with its offensive sets, boasting better coverage, more power, and more priority. Mienfoo has Regenerator + U-turn over these two, and has Knock Off over Meditite, as well as better speed than the other two.

Bulky Attacker
########
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Drain Punch / High Jump Kick
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Fake Out / Taunt
ability: Regenerator
item: Eviolite
evs: 76 HP / 116 Def / 36 SpD / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Drain Punch is the key move on the set, letting it kill several notable threats in the metagame, typically Pokemon weak to Fighting-type moves, such as Pawniard, or Tirtouga. Knock Off is an amazing move, taking items from opponents, and hitting stuff like Slowpoke and Misdreavus for solid damage. U-turn preserves momentum, letting you get out of a bad spot, and activates Regenerator. Fake Out lets you get chip damage, and can be use to break sturdy. However, you should not be spamming it, as it is predictable and offers free switch-ins to your opponent. Only use it when the chip damage is absolutely necessary. Taunt prevents setup, keeps stuff from statusing you, blocking recovery, and is great when used in conjunction with Mienfoo's decent speed tier. High Jump Kick is an option if power is necessary, but the lack of longevity is noticeable.

Set Details
========

Speed is maxed with optimized bulk, enhancing the ability to deal with Pawniard. Without the speed, standard Pawniard outspeeds and can land a KO with a +2 Iron Head, even with max bulk. If you aren't particularly concerned about Pawniard, a spread of 236 HP / 116 Def / 116 SDef with an Impish nature maximizes bulk, but if you are running Taunt, this is not advised. Eviolite is chosen to enhance bulk, and Regenerator provides extra healing, both are necessary to the nature of the set.

Usage Tips
========

This set is geared towards Bulky Offense and Balanced teams, as glue or a VoltTurn core. It should be used as a pivot, tanking resisted hits and hitting something with Knock Off, and KOing with Drain Punch as necessary, and switching out with U-turn. If your opponent has something faster that threatens Mienfoo out, such as Abra or Murkrow, you should not be U-turning, and should instead switch out manually. This set excels early- to mid-game, where it targets key threats and cripples them or takes them out.

Team Options
========

Mienfoo works well as part of a VoltTurn core. Chinchou can beat Murkrow and other flying-types, as well as helping with Slowpoke. Magnemite can do this similarly, but is not as bulky, and can beat Fairies that wall Mienfoo. Vullaby and Larvesta beat Foongus and Croagunk, and also have U-turn. A regencore can also be formed alongside Slowpoke and Foongus, creating a highly durable partnership, that spreads status around to weaken foes, helping Mienfoo spread Knock Off, further weakening a team for a sweep lategame. Foongus beats Spritzee, Slowpoke beats Meditite and Gligar, and Mienfoo beats bulky special walls that block the other two. Other fighting-types appreciate Mienfoo's ability to Knock Off walls such as Slowpoke and Spritzee. Dwebble and Tirtouga also appreciate this.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Drain Punch
move 4: U-turn
ability: Regenerator
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

High Jump Kick is your STAB move here, and your primary revenge killing move. Don't spam it if your opponent still has a ghost-type, since you run the risk of losing half of your health. Knock Off goes well with a scarf set, and can surprise something that would normally be faster than you, and helps clear out ghost-types. Drain Punch should be used when you don't want to risk a High Jump Kick miss, and need to revenge something. U-turn should be used on predicted switches, and can activate Regenerator. Stone Edge is also an option in order to hit Larvesta, and can be used over Drain Punch.

Set Details
========

The EVs are standard for an offensive Pokemon, maxing offenses, and Adamant is chosen to hit 24 speed after scarf. Choice Scarf fits the revenge killer and cleaner role of this set, and Regenerator is the best of your abilities.

Usage Tips
========

Should spam Knock Off and U-turn early game, using it's STAB to revenge kill when needed. High Jump Kick is powerful enough to clean up late game once all resists and immunities have been removed from the game. This set fits best on an fast offensive team, where the utility given by the Eviolite set is not needed.

Team Options
========

This set works best on a VoltTurn team, and appreciates partners such as Magnemite and Chinchou who help beat flying-types, as well as Archen. Larvesta and Vullaby are also appreciated, and can beat stuff like Foongus and Croagunk. Pursuit Pawniard is really cool, easily removing Misdreavus and other Ghost-types from the game, so it can clean up lategame. Other lategame sweepers, such as Tirtouga, also appreciate the Knock Off support. 

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Low Sweep / Fake Out
ability: Regenerator
item: Life Orb
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
High Jump Kick is your standard STAB, smacking things around for high damage.
Knock Off punishes your checks and counters by depriving them of their item while allowing you to hit Ghost-types.
U-turn preserves momentum and allows you to escape unfavorable matchups.
Low Sweep drops the speed of switch-ins, letting you get a fast U-turn off. This is useful against faster stuff like Murkrow and Gligar.
Fake Out is general priority and chip damage. You can use it if you are especially weak to Pokemon such as Dwebble or Tirtouga, although this is better done by the Bulky Attacker set. If you do include Fake Out, make sure not to give your opponents free switch-ins, and although the chip damage is nice, the life orb recoil can add up, even if you switch out.
Set Details
========
spread is standard for offensive mon, max/max/leftover in random stat, +speed nature.
life orb gives extra power and turns high jump kick into a fearsome attack, denting/koing mons neutral to it and smashing those weak to it.
Usage Tips
========
best off as a hit and run attacker on bulky offense and balanced teams that can go without the bulk of the bulky attacker set.
a little tougher to play with as it can't really take hits and is really hard to switch in since it's so frail. It also isn't nearly as reliable against pawniard, as you're beaten by a combination of knock off and sucker punch if it's at +2, and iron head flat out OHKOes you.
The power of this set is immense, and the strength the Knock Off + U-turn is amplified. You can even ko Slowpoke from full health with the combination.
works well early- and mid-game to weaken your opponents team and smash stuff with high jump kick
just smash stuff and knock off, really
Team Options
========
requires bulky team support and flying checks, magnemite, archen, and Chinchou fit the bill here.
Loves being on VoltTurn teams, and Vullaby and Larvesta are great teammates for the above reasons.
gligar handles pawniard since this set has trouble with it. Mienfoo can beat Slowpoke in return for gligar.
Other Options
########
a subpass set with life orb or Eviolite can be used on baton pass teams.
a reckless set with High Jump Kick can be used for even moar power, but regenerator is more advantageous.
HP Ice nails Gligar, although it doesn't hit much outside of that.
Force Palm can be used. It's paralysis chance is the same as scald's burn rate, and it can paralyze gligar.
Stone Edge hits flying-types and Larvesta.
Poison Jab can 2hko Spritzee after Knock Off
Checks & Counters
########
Gligar resists Mienfoo's STAB and doesn't take much from any of it's other moves, doesn't mind Knock Off, and can take it out with Acrobatics or Earthquake on weakened or offensive Mienfoo.
Fairy-types wall anything Mienfoo carries and hit Mienfoo super effectively, usually OHKOing it.
Poison types resist its stab and some are bulky enough to take most other hits. Foongus can constantly check it thanks to regenerator and it can hit it with stun spore. Koffing can burn it, Grimer has sticky hold, and Tentacool hurts it if it switches on Drain Punch thanks to liquid ooze.
Misdreavus can KO it with Dazzling Gleam, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and take it's attacks relatively well, but it won't like Knock Off.
Slowpoke has the bulk to take most attacks, although it won't like U-turn or Knock Off.
Flame Body users, notably Larvesta and Ponyta. Larvesta resists it's STAB and threaten a KO with Flare Blitz. Ponyta also threatens with Flare Blitz and outspeeds it.
Murkrow and other offensive Flying-types take it out with Flying-type STAB.
Abra outspeeds and OHKOes.
