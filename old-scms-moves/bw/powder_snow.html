<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to freeze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Powder Snow's low Base Power makes it a really bad choice when looking for a good special Ice-type move. There are better choices available, such as Ice Beam and Blizzard, both of which have much higher Base Powers than Powder Snow.</p>
