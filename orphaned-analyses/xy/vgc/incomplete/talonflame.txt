Overview
########
This generation's starter-bird is different to all the others in that it is Fire-/Flying-type rather than Normal-/Flying-type. It is also the only competitive one (barring Staraptor) due to its amazing ability: Gale Wings which gives prioroty to all Flying-type moves including non-damaging ones. This turns it into an offensive monster and a premier supporter in the VGCs, and something all teams must prepare for.

[Pros]
Gale wings is absolutely amazing turning it into an offensive monster or an amazing supporter
Fire/Flying is good offensive typing only dealt with by rock-types and Rotom-Wash
Access to the best offensive prioroty in the game and amazing defensive prioroty
[Cons]
Tiny movepool
Mediocre stats
4x rock weakness, as well as weakness to common Water- and Electric-type attacks


Offensive Support
########
name: Standard
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Flare Blitz
move 3: Tailwind / Quick Guard
move 4: Protect / Quick Guard
ability: Gale Wings
item: Life Orb / Sky Plate / Charti Berry
evs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe
nature: Adamant Nature

Moves
========
Brave Bird is the main attack, given prioroty by Gale Wings making it a scary thing to face if you don't resist it
Flare Blitz has near-perfect coverage with Brave Bird only resisted by Rock-types and Rotom-Wash as well as providing a solid secondary STAB
Tailwind is an amazing support option doubling your teams speed for the next few turns which can be the difference between dealing damage and fainting immediately when not in trick room
Quick Guard protects your side of the feild from prioroty moves, but a misprediction could be costly if you're not careful as it is a precious turn wasted.
Protect lets you scout at the cost of a protecting your teammate from possible Fake Outs among other moves.

Set Details
========
The given EVs maximise Talonflame's power while giving it as much bulk as is needed. This lets Talonflame survive a Rock Slide from Mega Tyranitar with the Charti Berry and always survive the chip damage from sandstorm. The speed lets Talonflame quick-guard Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out as well as prevent it from using Sucker Punch on the turn it mega evolves.
Life Orb maximises the power of all of Talonflames attacks, enabling Talonflame to gain a guaranteed 2HKO on 244 HP, bold Coba Berry Ludicolo, and so does the Sky Plate: giving Talonflame a little more survivability. However it significantly weakens Talonflame's Flare Blitz, and it's Brave Bird isn't quite as powerful.
The choice of item is based around personal preference: Charti Berry enables Talonflame to survive all rock slides including max attack adamant Mega Tyranitar's Rock Slide (252+ Atk Mega Tyranitar Rock Slide vs. 172 HP / 0 Def Charti Berry Talonflame: 138-164 (66.3 - 78.8%) -- guaranteed 2HKO after sandstorm damage).
If you are not running Charti Berry, you could run max speed to outpace every Fake Out-user (barring max-speed-positive-nature Raichu who you speed-tie with and max-speed-positive-nature Weavile who beats Talonflame outright) and Quick Guard against them. However, the given EVs enable Talonflame to block Kangaskhan's Fake Out on the turn it mega-evolves, which is the most common user of the move and lets Talonflame run Charti Berry with great success to take relatively low amounts of damage from Rock Slides meaning that ajusting the EVs to do this is only recommended if you have your heart set on Sky Plate or Life Orb.
There is no reason to run any nature aside from Adamant on Talonflame as it doesn't need a Jolly Nature due to Gale Wings and there is no point boosting Talonflame's defenses any further due to Talonflame's relative frailty.

Usage Tips
========
This set likes to be around early-game and support it's team with Tailwind and Quick Guard, but still be there later in the match to deal a finishing blow before it goes down with its powerful prioroty.

Team Options
========
Scizor deals with the Rock-types that are the bane of Talonflame's existance
Amoongus deals with Rotom-Wash by walling it and dealing heavy damage with a STAB Giga Drain, while helping supporting it's team with Spore and Rage Powder and being a decent check/counter to Trick Room - something that Tailwind teams dispise
Rotom Wash and Tyranitar deal with opposing Talonflame well with STAB attacks while walling it to no end.
Charizard can mega evolve and summon the sun to make Talonflame's Flare Blitz even more terrifying, as well as canceling Tyranitar's Sandstorm.
Rotom-Heat deals with rare Aerodactyl and opposing Talonflame, although it must be wary of Rock Slides from the former.
Garchomp and Talonflame make a terrifying offensive core with Garchomp having perfect neutral coverage in this metagame with it's dual STABs and access to Rock Slide to get rediculous amounts of damage on opposing Mega Charizard Y and opposing Talonflame that lack Charti Berry, while Talonflame has the best prioroty in the game in the form of Brave Bird, as well as hitting Scizor, Grass-types, Fighting-types, and the uncommon Vivillon harder.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Flare Blitz
move 3: U-Turn
move 4: Tailwind / Me First / Aerial Ace
ability: Gale Wings
item: Choice Band
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant Nature

Moves
========
Brave Bird gets prioroty with Talonflame's ability and is completely monsterous with the Choice Band boost.
Flare Blitz is the coverage move of choice, powering through the Steel-types that resist Brave Bird
U-Turn deals with Tyranitar, and switches Talonflame out which is helpful as you don't tend to want to be locked into Bug-type move, as well as luring a Rock Slide into your Rock-type resistance, or just something that you know can take it.
The last moveslot is very variable as Talonflame doesn't really have anything else it wants to be locked into. This means that there are drawbacks to all of the moves listed.
Me First will almost always steal the opponent's move and launch it back at them with 1.5x the power. However, if the opponent uses a non-damaging move, Me First will fail, which is something to bare in mind when using the move.
Acrobatics can help with late-game clean ups as well as being helpful if Talonflame has its item knocked off or stolen due to the lack of recoil. However you must bare in mind that it is laughably weak if Talonflame is still holding its Choice Band.
Set Details
========
The EVs are there deliberately to outpace opposing Talonflame while maximising Talonflame's attack power.
Adamant boosts your power to it's highest potential. Furthermore, there is no reason to run Jolly as the main move you will be using is Brave Bird anyway which has its prioroty boosted by Gale Wings.
Choice Band is obligatory on a Choice Band set, as well as turning Talonflame into a prioroty abusing nuke that you must be very wary of.

Usage Tips
========
I have 3 words for you: Brave Bird Everything!.
However, you must know when you should maybe not lock yourself into Brave Bird, as some teams are very resistant to the move, and you should instead U-Turn out or support your team with your fourth slot. Or just Flare Blitz Everything, although the lack of prioroty could be a deterrent from this strategy, but you're still a nuke when you use it.

Team Options
========
Trevenant can (just) take a Crunch from Tyranitar when at full health and retaliate with a powerful Horn Leech, as well as being able to play mind-games with the opponent by using Phantom Force.
Rotom-Wash, Heat and Mow formes can deal with opposing Talonflame (Wash and Heat) or Rotom-Wash and Tyranitar (Mow)
Fake Out is a big help as it can stall pokemon who are going to Rock Slide and give Talonflame the time to either a: 2HKO them or b: U-Turn out.
Quick Guard protects you from other Talonflame, and Wide Guard helps against Rock Slides.
Scizor and Talonflame make an amazing physical core and combination as Talonflame deals with the Steel-types that wall Scizor while Scizor takes down the Rock-types that wall Talonflame. However, you must be aware of Rotom-Wash and Heat who wall this combo and bring...
Amoongus and Tyranitar and/or Garchomp. The former deals with Rotom-Wash with it's STAB Giga Drain while the latter two deal with Rotom-Heat using Rock Slide.
Haxorus can deal with Rotom formes aside from the uncommon Mow forme and the nigh-unseen Fan forme using by breaking the mold and using Earthquake.

Other Options
########
Talonflame has a near-naked offensive movepool, but it does have decent supporting movepool as well as a few other offensive options options.
By far the most viable of these is the range of options that could go onto the standard set including Will-O-Wisp, Taunt and Roost as they all have very valuable purposes.
Overheat and a mild nature could be run on the standard set in the place of Flare Blitz utilising an EV spread of 172 Atk / 252 SpA / 84 Sp catching many players off guard. However, this forces the Life Orb onto Talonflame which many players find unattractive due to the high levels of recoil on Brave Bird. Furthermore, if a pokemon has prepared to take Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave, it will often do less damage than Flare Blitz.
On the subject of Overheat, Talonflame has a range of special moves it can run which could warrent a fully special set, but the majority of them are laughably weak.
Talonflame could use Acrobatics in case its item has been used up or knocked off - most notably on the standard set. However, this is a little unreliable to be recommended, and without the boost it is ironically weaker than Aerial Ace.
Natural Gift could be used on the All Out Offense with Liechi Berry, Salac Berry or Charti Berry to give Talonflame a base 100 Grass-type move (Liechi Berry), base 100 Fighting-type move (Salac Berry) or a base 80 Rock-type move (Charti Berry - Damn you for not existing in Pokemon X and Pokemon Y Micle Berry!). The former can be useful if Talonflame doesn't use Natural Gift, the latter can help Talonflame take a Rock-type move before Natural Gift is used, and the Salac speeds up Talonflame's other moves when you don't use Natural Gift. However, Natural Gift can only be used once, and the former barely 2HKOs Rotom-Wash, and doesn't ever if it is holding Sitrus Berry, the latter's only use is to OHKO Talonflame that lack Charti Berry and Mega Charizard Y which, while they are both very big threats, are both dealt with reasonably well with Brave Bird anyway, and the Salac Berry only really hits Tyranitar. Furthermore, you have teammates to deal with said pokemon for Talonflame anyway.
Finally, Talonflame has access to Swords Dance and Bulk Up which could go on the standard set, but setting up is risky in doubles and, as such, isn't recommended.

Checks & Counters
########
Rotom Wash and Rotom Heat is as close as you can get to a counter to Talonflame as they resist both of it's dual STABs and takes little from it's coverage options, while still being able to retaliate with STAB, super effective Thunderbolt.
Tyranitar is also a good counter as it resists Talonflame's dual STABs and can threaten with a STAB, 4x super effective Rock Slide in return, however it must be wary of a possible U-Turn.
Most other Rock-types also wall Talonflame's dual STABs and threaten with STAB, 4x super effective Rock Slides of their own.
Opposing Talonflame are psuedo-checks to Talonflame due to also having Gale Wings and will sometimes run more speed EVs than your own Talonflame.
Slowbro can tank Talonflame's hits and threaten with a STAB, super effective Scald or Surf, although it must be cautious of U-Turn.
Quick Guard messes with Gale Wings, which is an issue when facing it.
Intimidate users, particularly Gyarados, mess with Talonflame's already middling attack stat.
Aegislash can, with the correct prediction, use King's Shield to cripple Aegislash offensively and cause it to switch which can often be dangerous in a 4v4 doubles environment. However, it must be wary of Flare Blitz.
