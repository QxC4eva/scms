<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of +1. Damage is boosted to 1.2x by the ability Iron Fist.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Mach Punch is one of the best priority moves available since Fighting is a good attacking type. A slow, powerful Fighting-type, such as Conkeldurr, can use the move to threaten faster, frail, or weakened threats that could otherwise outspeed and KO it. Mach Punch is an excellent means of dealing with Pokemon such as Terrakion, Hydreigon, and Scarf Tyranitar, and has great coverage on several other powerful threats.</p>
