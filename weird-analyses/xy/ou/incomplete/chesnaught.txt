Moves
=====

    Spiky Shield is a must. It is a useful scouting tool. It also damages many threats such as Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Genesect. Alongside Leech Seed, you will have plenty of chip damage to support the team.
    Leech Seed is a great at dealing chip damage and getting out of tough situations when combined with Spiky Shield.
    Hammer Arm deals heavy damage to threats weak to it such as Excadrill, Tyranitar and Ferrothorn. It also serves as Chesnaught's only STAB move.
    Synthesis provides reliable recovery needed when Mega Venusaur is present. It also helps when Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery isn't enough to survive strong hits.
    Roar is a useful option to force out sweepers such as SD Aegislash, Garchomp and Gengar without Sludge Wave.

Set Details
========

    Spamming Leech Seed even on a risky predicted switch is a very useful tactic, except for when Grass-types are present. If you think that the opposing Pokemon will stay in, use Spiky Shield. The only exception to this is if they have a setup move, in which case you should either use Leech Seed or switch out. This is especially a great way to

Usage Tips
========

    Remember that Chesnaught has Bulletproof! It gives it a wide variety of switch in options such as Aegislash and Gengar without Sludge Wave
    Chesnaught isn't meant to be used as a wall, it's a tank designed to force switches and cause chip damage.

Team Options
==========

    Tyranitar can take special attacks, cover Chesnaught's Fire-, Flying-, and Psychic weaknesses, and can either provide Pursuit support or use Stealth Rock to help Chesnaught deal more damage. Don't worry about Tyranitar reducing Chesnaugt's recovery; there is rarely a time when you'll encounter a Grass-type in Sandstorm. You just saw me use a colon.
    Specially Defensive Heatran provides Stealth Rock and Toxic, as well as something to take special attacks.
    Rotom-Wash heavily damages Flying- and Fire-types and has Will-O-Wisp to spread burn.
    Scizor and Bisharp can use Pursuit to prevent Latias and Latios from using Defog.

Other Options
=========

    Spikes
    Stone Edge
    Seed Bomb

Checks and Counters
==============

    Crobat is the best counter. It can deal heavy damage to Chesnaught with Brave Bird clear Stealth Rock with Defog, Taunt to shut Chesnaught down and make it lose momentum, and U-turn to get even more momentum with a free switch in.
    Talonflame can KO Chesnaught with a priority Brave Bird, U-turn out, and stall with a priority Roost.
    Skarmory can set up hazards and deal heavy damage with Brave Bird.
    Hawlucha can set up Swords Dance and smash Chesnaught with a +2 Acrobatics.
    Xatu threatens Chesnaught with Psychic and can Magic Bounce nearly all of it's Chesnaught's moves away.
    Trevenant and Gourgeist are immune to Fighting-type moves and can easily take the rest of Chesnaught's moves.
    King's Shield + Swords Dance Aegislash can set up on Chesnaught. However, Chesnaught can check any Aegislash without Hidden Power Ice.
    Specially attacking Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y force Chesnaught out with a STAB Fire Blast.
