<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Used to heal poison, paralysis, sleep, burn, confusion, and freeze.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Casteliacone is definitely not a competitive item. It isn't consumable, making it a total waste of an item. If you're looking for an item that heals all status conditions and actually works, use the Lum Berry.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Castelia City (every Tuesday except during winter)</p>
