<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's accuracy one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>An exclusive move from Alakazam's line, which thanks to poor distribution is not very well known. The effect is not particularly useful in most competitive matches because reducing the foe's accuracy is not a reliable strategy, as the opponent can simply switch out to negate the effect. The majority of players would prefer to incapacitate a foe completely (inducing sleep, for example) or simply use a set-up move. Finally, with the imperfect accuracy, it is outclassed by several other similar moves like Flash and Sand-Attack. You shouldn't use this.</p>
