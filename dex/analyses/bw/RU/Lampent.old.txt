[Overview]

<p>Although NFE, Lampent isn't completely useless. It has a usable Special Attack stat along with a few offensive moves, access to Trick Room, and low Speed. Also, being NFE, it can use Eviolite to raise its defenses. Its part Ghost typing means it can act as a Spinblocker for your team, though its secondary typing is a major thorn in its side. Unfortunately, Lampent was cursed with a weakness to Stealth Rock, and it is also weak to common Rock-, Ground-, Water-, Dark-, and Ghost-type moves. Although it doesn't look like much, Lampent can have a major impact on gameplay and, if used correctly, it can support its teammates time and time again.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lampent's poor Speed means it can use Trick Room effectively. The main idea is to switch into an attack it resists or is immune to, and then set up Trick Room. After Trick Room has been set up, its up to you whether you use Lampent as a sweeper or allow a teammate to abuse Trick Room. Fire Blast is Lampent's most powerful STAB move, and it will leave large dents in anything that doesn't resist it. From the third slot onwards, you can choose a variation of Shadow Ball, Taunt, Memento, Energy Ball, and Hidden Power Rock. If you choose to use Lampent defensively, Taunt and Memento are the best options, whereas if you want to play offensively, Shadow Ball should be used with Energy Ball or Hidden Power Rock. Energy Ball is used to hit Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types, while Hidden Power Rock allows Lampent to hit other Fire-types such as Typhlosion or Moltres. Flash Fire is a handy ability as it grants Lampent an immunity to Fire-type moves, which makes it that much easier to switch in.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs focus on Lampent's Special Attack and HP, which allows it to dish out reasonable amounts of damage while still surviving hits. With 248 HP EVs, Lampent can survive four switch-ins to Stealth Rock; any more would result in Lampent fainting. A more defensive spread can be used if you want Lampent to survive longer, but this isn't recommended as Lampent is more of a "suicide" Pokemon. A Focus Sash can be used if you wish to use Lampent as a lead, though Taunt users are common and make Lampent helpless most of the time. An Iron Ball or Macho Brace can be used to lower Lampent's Speed even further, which ensures that nothing will outspeed it in Trick Room. Finally, Lampent can use an Air Balloon to avoid Ground-type attacks, but this is risky as any other attack can burst it.</p>

<p>Due to its Fire typing, Lampent appreciates support in the form of Rapid Spin. Cryogonal and Kabutops are both fine choices, as they are the most reliable spinners in the tier. Entry hazards also work well in conjunction with Lampent thanks to its ability to block Rapid Spin. Ferroseed and Crustle are good choices for Pokemon to set up hazards due to their good defenses and handy resistances. If you opt to use Memento in the last slot, Lampent will require partners who can take advantage of Trick Room. Omastar, Hariyama, and Tangrowth are great choices thanks to their high offensive stats and poor Speed.</p>

<p>Because of this set's specially oriented nature, Pokemon such as Clefable and Mandibuzz need to be removed from play. A powerful physical attacker, such as Gallade, is an excellent choice thanks to its unpredictability and wide movepool. Rotom can also be used with Substitute and Pain Split to weaken defensive Pokemon, but Toxic Spikes are recommended when doing so. Pokemon who can switch into Lampent's weaknesses are helpful; Steelix can switch into Rock-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks, and Lilligant can switch into Water- and Ground-type attacks.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Looking at Lampent's stats, you'd think it was too frail to be a defensive Pokemon. Luckily, Lampent isn't fully evolved, so Eviolite can be used to boost its defenses. Lampent makes an excellent spinblocker, and thanks to its immunity to Fighting- and Fire-type moves, Lampent can take on threats such as Sceptile, Lilligant, Typhlosion, and Moltres with ease. Flamethrower and Shadow Ball are used for reliable STAB, but Clear Smog should also be considered to remove stat boosts; note that Clear Smog will not affect Steel-types or Pokemon behind a Substitute, however. Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers upon switching in, while Pain Split is used for recovery. Taunt can be used to stop opponents from setting up or afflicting Lampent with status.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on this set maximize Lampent's Special Defense and HP stats and give it the ability to take on a variety of specially-based threats in RU. A physically defensive spread can be used with an EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD to give Lampent an easier time with physical attackers such as Entei and Hitmonlee, but just watch out for Earthquake and Stone Edge. 248 HP EVs are used rather than 252 because Lampent has an even HP number, which means it would faint upon its fourth switch in to Stealth Rock with maximum investment.</p>

<p>As this is a primarily defensive set, Lampent requires teammates who can switch into its weaknesses. Poliwrath can switch into Water- and Rock-type moves, and Lilligant can switch into Water- and Ground-type attacks. Rapid Spin support is also helpful due to Lampent's Stealth Rock weakness; this can be provided by Kabutops, Hitmonchan, or Cryogonal. Entry hazard support is helpful as Lampent acts as a great spinblocker. Drapion can set up Toxic Spikes and switch into Ghost- and Dark-type attacks, and Ferroseed can set up Spikes with its resistance to Water- and Dark-type attacks. Finally, Wish support should be considered, as Lampent doesn't have a reliable recovery move of its own. Clefable is an excellent choice, as it can switch into Ghost-type attacks, remove status with Heal Bell, and set up Stealth Rock to cripple the opponent.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Lampent has access to a few other moves, but most of them are highly situational or gimmicky. Hex can be used alongside Toxic Spikes to hit the opponent with a 150 Base Power move, and Lampent's spinblocking ability means that the opponent will be unable to remove the Toxic Spikes. Lampent has access to Calm Mind, though it has poor Speed and its HP stat isn't good enough to set up with. Overheat is more powerful than Fire Blast, but due to its secondary effect, Lampent is forced to switch out a lot, which will force it to constantly lose HP due to its weakness to Stealth Rock. Psych Up can be used to steal stat boosts from the opponent, but again, Lampent is too slow to abuse it. Finally, Substitute provides a safety net for Lampent should it be lucky enough to use it when an opponent switches; it also prevents the opponent from statusing Lampent.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Lampent is primarily specially-based, so any Pokemon with decent Special Defense can take it on. Clefable is a defensive option, though it is unable to deal much damage outside of Toxic. Water-types such as Slowking and Omastar resist Lampent's Fire-type STAB, and their STAB Water-type moves make quick work of it. Mandibuzz and Drapion can switch in to Shadow Ball, and either cripple Lampent with Taunt or KO it with their STAB Dark-type moves. Rock- and Ground-types such as Kabutops and Rhydon can take on Lampent with ease, and their STAB moves will KO Lampent in the blink of an eye. Lampent is also weak to Stealth Rock, so forcing it to switch a lot will weaken it significantly. Finally, Lampent is hit super effectively by Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, so abuse them as much as you can.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Lampent gains Shadow Tag as its Dream World ability. Wobbuffett and Wynaut are the only other Pokemon to have this ability, and they were Ubers last generation for good reason. Shadow Tag can trap a helpless opponent, such as a Typhlosion Choice-locked onto Eruption, and use this time to either set up or score an easy KO. Lampent becomes extremely deadly if it manages to abuse Shadow Tag and set up 6 Calm Mind boosts, so consider a Calm Mind set if Shadow Tag is available to you.</p>
