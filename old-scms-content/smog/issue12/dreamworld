<h2>Introduction</h2>

Many people speculated up until release of <em>Pokémon Black and White</em> about potentially massive mechanic changes. Past generations have brought EVs, natures,  abilities, the physical/special split, and new types to the table, and  while BW appears to be quite similar to DP mechanically, it did bring  one noteworthy change&mdash;the Dream World.

Similar to how DP had the  GTS, BW has the Global Link, and one of its components is the Dream  World, which is operated from the internet and allows the downloading of  Pokémon, many of whom cannot be found in Isshu. Nearly every Pokémon (barring the likes of Slaking and Castform, as well as several others)  comes with a Dream World-exclusive ability of their own, data of which exists in the game, and, in certain cases, special moves.  The Eevee family were advertised pre-release as having unique  abilities, with Vaporeon getting Hydration for one.

Unfortunately, we currently don't know much  about the distribution mechanism, which Pokémon will be released when,  or the RNG. What we do know is what each Pokémon gets and what the new  abilities do, and some of these are nothing short of revolutionary, the  best example being Ditto with Eccentric. Research on the Dream World is  being conducted in <a  href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=80928">Uncharted  Territory</a>, focusing on what's available to be encountered  right now, so while initial Gen V won't start with all of the Dream  World abilities, it will start with the obtainable ones. Here are just  some of the more exciting and notable changes!

<h2>The List</h2>

<h3>Ditto - Eccentric</h3>

This is the most obviously important change; Eccentric completely  changes how Ditto is used and may well propel it to OU, a welcome rise  from the depths of NU. Non-Eccentric Ditto suffers from a number of  issues, an important one being that it's too frail and slow to Transform  while taking an attack, and finding a free turn is not easy. As such,  its problems make its potential utility fairly inconsistent. Eccentric  solves this problem and transforms Ditto into the opponent automatically  upon switch-in, and furthermore, it copies all direct stat changes  (e.g. boosts from Swords Dance but not Choice Band), making it a  significant threat with Choice Scarf to stat-up sweepers like Dragon  Dancers.

However, being Choice-locked in means clever switching is still  possible, but Eccentric is definitely a huge improvement, making Ditto  into a one-size-fits-all check!

<h3>Blaziken - Speed Boost</h3>

To be fair, it still doesn't completely outclass Infernape, which is  naturally faster, stronger, and now gets... Iron Fist. Yay? Just  kidding, Speed Boost Blaziken is huge, and it sure has turned the tables  on that wretched monkey. After a few turns, which may be hastened by  Protect (though Blaziken would like its move slot back, thank you very much, particularly if it wants to run Swords  Dance), Blaziken will outspeed pretty much everything on your team, and  plow through it with its Hi Jump Kicks. We know from Infernape in the  4th gen that Fire and Fighting are lovely dual STABs, and they aren't  resisted by many things in combination with each other. It always has  auxiliary attacks to take care of the ones that do. One example of a  Blaziken check is Shanderaa, which is obliterated by Stone Edge, and  another is Burungeru (the Water/Ghost-type), which doesn't take  ThunderPunches too well either. Longevity and frailty (especially when  you take high-priority moves into account) will still plague it, but  Speed Boost completely changes how we look at Blaziken. From sadly  outclassed to kickass, it only took one change to make the future so  much more exciting.

<h3>Shanderaa - Shadow Tag</h3>

A fifth gen addition, Shanderaa is a powerful special attacking  Ghost/Fire-type. Most players will know, at least from hearsay, that  Shadow Tag is one of the best abilities in the game. Wobbuffet uses  Shadow Tag to trap all of its opponents and defeat them with strategies  like Counter / Mirror Coat, Encore, and Tickle, or else create an  opportunity for its teammate by Encoring a non-threatening move and  switching. Shanderaa doesn't have these kinds of support moves, but it  does have strong STABs, and a highly useful typing, as well as the  option of Calm Mind. It can trap and kill a lot of things on stall teams  (such as Skarmory and 5th gen's Nattorei), as well as take out a range  of threats for once and for all.

Sadly, Shanderaa has unfortunate weaknesses to Water, Dark, Ghost,  Ground, and Rock, meaning just about every offensive Pokémon has  something to hit it with, particularly if it wants to Calm Mind.  Nonetheless, I expect great things should Shadow Tag Shanderaa ever  become available.

<h3>Ninetales - Drought + Politoed - Drizzle</h3>

Seemingly randomly, Game Freak decided to troll us by including Drought  and Drizzle on other Pokémon, though they haven't been encountered yet.  Ninetales and (especially) Politoed are almost never seen in OU and  Ubers in DP, mainly because they're not very good and also because for  every Ninetales and Politoed you throw at me, I can name a similar  Pokémon with superior attributes. Drought and Drizzle add some highly  valuable sources of weather changing to the mix, and right now there's  no chance of them being outclassed in that respect.

In 4th gen, Drizzle and Drought were seen as way too overpowered, given  the plethora of Pokémon who can take too much advantage of the perma  weather, and also because Kyogre and Groudon are just insanely strong in  their own right (from Choice Specs Water Spouts and Calm Minding to  Rock Polish sweeps and tanking), even if you factor out the team support  aspect. But now with two mediocre-at-best Pokémon with those abilities,  we're forced to evaluate whether they really are too broken, being on  Pokémon that are otherwise basically a liability at high power levels.  Of course, if Policy Review decides to start with a clean slate as far  as bans go, they'll find themselves in the same position as usual,  contending with plain better Pokémon (Kyogre and Groudon). But in tiers  where Kyogre and Groudon aren't allowed, these two will surely find a  use, especially with all the Pokémon with Swift Swim, Chlorophyll, etc.  who are roughly equivalent in power.

<h3>Ho-Oh - Regeneration</h3>

Ho-Oh doesn't need much of a boost, with that fantastic stat  distribution, the effective STAB combination of Sacred Fire and Brave  Bird, and 50% instant healing in Roost. Granted, in 4th gen Ubers, it's  rather slow, but the main reason it's been consistently underrated is  its crippling 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, resulting in 50% less HP each  time Ho-Oh switches in with SR on the field. Regeneration alleviates  the damage by restoring 33% HP each time Ho-Oh switches out. While it  does have Roost, every bit of recovery counts, and 33% is major,  especially considering Ho-Oh can't always be Roosting. Assuming Ho-Oh is  over 17% HP once it switches out, it won't die to Stealth Rock  switching in again either.

Really, I don't think there's much to be said about Ho-Oh itself. It's  undeniably a fearsome Pokémon, and Regeneration is just the icing on a  very sweet cake. Should Ho-Oh ever be released with Regeneration, the  metagame needs to watch out! 

<h3>Gyarados and Salamence - Overconfidence</h3>

Overconfidence, also known as the mistranslated Earthquake Spiral,  boosts Attack by one stage each time the Pokémon KOes an opponent  (directly, not by passive damage). Let me repeat that less succinctly.  For each kill Salamence and Gyarados get, their Attack rises for free,  meaning you can't freely sacrifice something to them without making them  all the more powerful. Unfortunately, for the moment it seems that  Overconfidence is incompatible with the 4th gen tutor moves, meaning  that Salamence can't run Outrage alongside it.

To be fair, these two will have to forfeit an extremely enviable ability  in Intimidate to use Overconfidence, but it's not much of a loss.  Intimidate does help them set up and gives them some great team support  (Gyarados in particular needs Intimidate to make it such an effective  Fighting-type counter on stall teams), but being able to pick off  anything and nab a free Attack boost is worth it.

Lastly, in fairness's sake, I'll also add that Heracross, Pinsir,  Mightyena, and Honchkrow also got it, but who really cares about them  compared to the aforementioned OU powerhouses?

<h3>Zapdos - Lightningrod</h3>

Lightningrod itself received a heavy boost in the 5th gen; instead of  being useless in singles while drawing Electric attacks in doubles, it  now provides an immunity to Electric, as well as boosting Special Attack  by one stage. Think of it like Motor Drive for Special Attack. Imagine  Zapdos coming in on your powerful Thunderbolt, but not only did it take  no damage from it, it got a free power boost as well! While Pressure is  still a huge boost to it defensively, Lightningrod's granted immunity is  a boon not to be taken lightly, and the boost to its Thunderbolts are  very welcome also.

<h3>Breloom - Technician</h3>

There's a lot to say for Poison Heal. It makes Breloom a great status  absorber and a frustrating SubSeeder. It's pretty hard to kill it if  it's already got a Substitute up and is also taking recovery from Leech  Seed (and maybe even Leftovers if there's no sand or hail about). It also  helps those appalling effects. But there's a lot to say for Technician  Breloom as well. Mach Punch is a huge asset, and so is the  newly-strengthened Bullet Seed, which nearly always outdamages Seed Bomb  with Technician. It takes away from its defensive attributes but  enhances its offensive attributes, making it a dangerous threat, and  Mach Punch helps make up for its... disappointing, to say the least...  Speed.

<h3>Quagsire - Unaware</h3>

As if Gastrodon needed more reasons to eat its heart out, its sworn  enemy and fierce rival Quagsire was given Unaware, just to stamp on  stat-up sweepers even more. Completely ignoring your Lucario's stat  boosts, it survives your Close Combat or Aura Sphere and retaliates with  Earthquake, taking it out in one hit. Your Calm Mind Suicune can't do  much unboosted, either, but has to fear Encore. Damp and Water Absorb  are already fabulous abilities with their own respective uses, so don't  expect to see every Quagsire carrying Unaware if Quagsire is released,  but definitely keep it in mind.

An honourary mention goes to Swampert, which was already awesome enough;  it gets Damp, which stops your pesky Metagross lead from blowing up in  its face. However, it may have to forfeit Stealth Rock to use Damp. What  a shame!

<h3>Espeon - Magic Mirror</h3>

Yet another one in this list of cool Pokémon that are outclassed or  simply not good enough to compensate for their shortcomings, Espeon  landed its extremely cute self an awesome ability called Magic Mirror.  While its full mechanics haven't been confirmed yet, suffice to say it  acts like an automatic Magic Coat, a huge upgrade from Synchronize. Any  unsuspecting person hoping to set up hazards on that harmless little  kitty cat is in for a huge shock. At the very least, it prevents the  opponent from setting up on it, something a lot of other Pokémon are  currently greener than a shiny Espeon about.

<h3>Raikou - Volt Absorb + Entei - Flash Fire + Suicune - Water Absorb</h3>

As an alternative to Pressure, these three may one day have Volt Absorb,  Flash Fire, and Water Absorb, giving them an immunity and form of  recovery (or, in Entei's case, a way to power up its Fire attacks).  Raikou and Jolteon have always been reasonably comparable as far as  Electric-type special attackers go, and the gap was just bridged even  further. However, Suicune may not always opt to use Water Absorb; if  defensive sets like CroCune are used, Pressure may be more viable  because it lets Suicune stall out the likes of Blissey and other  CroCune, while Rest will give it recovery aplenty. More offensive sets  lacking Rest, however, would greatly appreciate the immunity to Water  and easier switch-ins. To give a DPPt example, Starmie's Hydro Pumps  don't particularly cripple Suicune, but it isn't getting that HP back in  a hurry without Rest, and it'll need it to take the ensuing  Thunderbolt.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The Dream World has undoubtedly boosted a lot of Pokémon, particularly  some of the could-be-awesome-but-sadly-lacking UUs and NUs you tried  when you were new to DPPt but gave up on in frustration, and while we're  no stranger to balancing and creating Pokémon here on Smogon, I have to  admit Game Freak have outdone themselves here! I've hardly covered all  the abilities, and we don't know to what extent they will affect the  metagame, or even if some of these Pokémon will ever see the light of  day, but this article hopefully gave you a good idea of what to hope for  in the future (or panic over!). I neglected to discuss some  particularly interesting specimens, such as Jaroda with Perversity and  Exeggutor with Harvest, and I've also ignored the useless additions,  such as Slip Through on Jumpluff, Soundproof on Abomasnow, Perversity on  Shuckle, and Keen Eye on Drapion. What's that, you say? Daruma Mode  Hihidaruma? Daruma what? Sorry, I don't even want to <em>talk</em> about it...
