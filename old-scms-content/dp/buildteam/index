<p>This program previously allowed users to assemble six Pokémon from the Smogon Strategy Pokédex into a team and then download that team as a team file for use on the simulator <a href="http://pokemonlab.com">Shoddy Battle</a>. This was intended to expedite team creation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this feature is no longer available.</p>
