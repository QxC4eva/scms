Overview
########

While Greninja's instant popularity in contrast to its viability is certainly a hot topic of debate, it can be argued that unlike other Pokemon, it has actually earned its celebrity status. Greninja is a powerful threat to watch out for in OU because it has a number of defining qualities, including its incredibly high Speed stat, fantastic offensive ability in Protean, and plethora of coverage moves to utilize said ability with. The only things holding Greninja back from unquestionable stardom are its otherwise average offensive stats, frailty, and vulnerability to common priority attacks. Because of these drawbacks, Greninja can be KOed relatively easily by opposing tanks and a large number of priority users, so it is forced to run fully special sets to reap as much coverage and power as possible. Fortunately, these factors don't stop Greninja from being a truly dangerous monster to prepare for, as it can significantly weaken or even swiftly clean teams with just a little team support.


All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Dark Pulse / Extrasensory
move 4: U-turn / Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Fire
ability: Protean
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Timid

Moves
========

With any combination of the given moves, Greninja attains great power and coverage to batter the opposition with. Hydro Pump is the most powerful special attack that Greninja can opt to run outside of Hyper Beam, benefits from great coverage, and should be used against bulkier targets in general. Ice Beam is essential for this set, as it provides coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types, and also operates as Greninja's main "STAB" move if Hydro Pump's inaccuracy is too risky.

The rest of the set comes down to preference. Greninja must unfortunately risk losing coverage against some of its counters if it chooses specific moves. Dark Pulse hits Psychic- and Ghost-types super effectively, including important bulky targets such as Aegislash and Jellicent. On the other hand, Extrasensory allows Greninja to heavily damage some of its most important counters, including Keldeo, Tentacruel, Conkeldurr, and Mega Venusaur. U-turn is a great option for reliable scouting early-game, and somewhat compensates for any possible coverage issues. It also hits some threats, such as Celebi and Latias, harder than all Greninja's other moves. Hidden Power Grass can be run to hit opposing Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types hard, but is mainly used to hit popular bulky targets such as Rotom-W and Gastrodon. Hidden Power Fire can be used to reliably hit a smaller, but equally important list of targets, especially Ferrothorn, specially defensive Scizor, and Forretress.

Grass Knot can be used instead of Hidden Power Grass, but differs somewhat in its targets. The move is reserved for Jellicent and Tyranitar, and can be used if Greninja needs to compensate for lost coverage against Jellicent if it lacks Dark Pulse.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment with either a Timid or Naive nature gives Greninja maximum power and a huge advantage over many fast unboosted threats, including Alakazam, Tornadus-T, Starmie, and Latios, as well as Choice Scarf Tyranitar. These threats are so important that Modest and Rash natures should not even be considered. A Naive nature is chosen to avoid gimping the power of U-turn, and is preferred over a Hasty nature in order for Greninja to take some resisted priority moves better. However, if Greninja does not run U-turn, it should use a Timid nature. Life Orb is also a requirement, as Greninja needs all the power it can get. Unlike other Pokemon, Greninja is not bothered by Life Orb recoil to the point that it needs to consider alternative items such as Expert Belt.

Usage Tips
========

This set can be used at any time in the game; it's your call as to whether Greninja is an early- to mid-game threat or a late-game cleaner. Due to its frailty, Greninja should typically be sent in via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, or after a teammate has fainted.

As a word of caution, do not overestimate Greninja's capabilities. Even with Protean boosting its attacks, Greninja cannot OHKO many bulky opponents, such as Keldeo, Latias, and Togekiss at full heath, giving many of them opportunities to retaliate. Greninja should not switch into such Pokemon, or if it is up against them, it should retreat (with U-turn if possible) and allow another Pokemon to either handle the threat or weaken it so it can be KOed later on. Additionally, do not attempt to wall Pokemon or tank resisted hits with the help of Protean, as Greninja is very frail and additional damage along with Life Orb recoil will quickly bring it down. However, changing types to make Greninja resistant or neutral to otherwise fatal attacks is perfectly acceptable in desperate situations.

Team Options
========

Greninja applies tons of offensive pressure against most teams, and thus appreciates entry hazards to rack up additional damage and punish switches. Reliable hazards setters include Deoxys-S, Smeargle, and, especially for VoltTurn teams, Landorus-T. U-turn Greninja is a great fit on VoltTurn teams for the reasons provided above, so it pairs well with Pokemon such as Thundurus, Landorus-T, and Scizor, as they cover each others' checks and counters. As Greninja will occasionally be required to sweep when the situation calls for it, it might need additional insurance against special walls such as Blissey, Sylveon, and Rotom-W. Scizor can typically handle the former two, while Goodra, Latias, and Assault Vest Conkeldurr can typically absorb Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and hit back hard.

Spikes
########
name: Spikes
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: U-turn / Extrasensory
ability: Protean
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Timid

Moves
========

Due to the amount of switches and free turns Greninja generates, it has many opportunities to use Spikes to support its teammates and inflict more damage. Hydro Pump provides great power and coverage, and Ice Beam serves as a good alternative main move to Hydro Pump. Ice Beam typically KOes common users of Defog, including Latios, Latias, and Mandibuzz, that might switch in to remove the entry hazards on the field. U-turn is somewhat complementary with Greninja's chosen entry hazard, as it allows Greninja to escape Rapid Spin users on top of other usual counters. Extrasensory is an alternative option to reliably hit Keldeo, Mega Venusaur, and most importantly, Tentacruel. Hidden Power Ghost can also be used to turn Greninja into a spinblocker; however, it is significantly inferior to other attacks in terms of its overall power, coverage, and usability. Toxic Spikes is also worth considering to wear down defensive targets such as Chansey and Jellicent; however, keep in mind that Toxic Spikes are generally easier to remove and do not affect Pokemon with the ability Levitate.

Set Details
========

Greninja needs to be as fast as possible to lay down Spikes, and as powerful as it can be to score KOs on opponents when needed. Therefore, the usual combination of maximum Speed and Special Attack with Life Orb will suffice for this set. As far as other options are concerned, Focus Sash almost guarantees that Greninja will be able to set up at least one layer of hazards or survive an attack and KO back.

Usage Tips
========

Although this set employs Spikes, only lay them down when you believe it is necessary. It is not recommended to miss important potential KO opportunities against Pokemon that give your teammates trouble just to lay a single layer of Spikes. Instead, attempt to lay hazards down early-game when Greninja can force a multitude of switches, and use Spikes against predicted switches or against walls that can't hurt it too much. One of Greninja's best opportunities to lay down hazards is the face of slower Pokemon that rely on Electric-type moves. Spikes will turn Greninja into a Ground-type thanks to Protean, and will make it immune to Volt Switch and other Electric-type moves, essentially giving it another free turn to use Spikes or attack. Keep in mind that multiple layers of Spikes or Toxic Spikes are not necessary, as Greninja might not find multiple opportunities to set multiple layers of entry hazards.

When attacking, the premise is the same as with the all-out attacker set; simply attack and watch the opponent's Pokemon take huge amounts of damage or switch out, racking up even more damage from entry hazards.

Team Options
========

Spikes Greninja is best suited for offensive teams where dedicated leads or hazard layers such as Deoxys-S (which offers different coverage) are unwanted. Greninja differentiates itself from these archetypes due to its outstanding offensive presence. Furthermore, by forcing switches, it provides itself with setup opportunities. Spikes Greninja should be paired with offensive Pokemon that benefit from grounded checks and counters being worn down. Swords Dance Lucario is a great example, as it needs just one layer of Spikes to guarantee the OHKO on physically defensive Hippowdon and other walls. Pokemon that can apply offensive pressure, force switches, and thus rack up more damage, such as Substitute Kyurem-B and bulky Rotom-W, can be used alongside both types of Spikes.

Although Greninja typically isn't bothered by the presence of Rapid Spin and Defog users, running a spinblocker is a good idea to counteract the former if your Pokemon are truly reliant on Spikes or Toxic Spikes. Gengar can take on common Rapid Spin users outside of Starmie, which Greninja outspeeds and can threaten with U-turn. Defog is a little harder to prevent, but attempts can either be blocked with Greninja's powerful attacks, another teammate's Taunt, or the oft-unprepared-for Defiant Bisharp. If using Bisharp, consider pairing both Greninja and Bisharp with Air Balloon Aegislash to limit the amount of hazards opposing Deoxys-S or Deoxys-D can set up, in addition to preventing Excadrill from spamming Earthquake against all three Pokemon.


Other Options
########

A physical set is inferior due to Greninja's limited list of physical moves, most of which are weak and lack coverage (they are mostly Water-, Dark-, and Normal-type moves). The only other physical move worth nothing outside of U-turn is Shadow Sneak; specifically, it can be used to revenge kill weakened Deoxys-S and avoid incoming Normal- or Fighting-type moves (such as Mach Punch and Superpower) from the likes of Diggersby and Conkeldurr. A mixed set is also inferior, as Greninja will have to split EVs between Attack, Special Attack, and Speed just to boost its physical moves. Water Shuriken might seem cool on paper for revenge killing Talonflame, but it is of limited use since it takes up a moveslot and does physical damage.


Checks & Counters
########

**Residual Damage**: Greninja is frail and relies on Life Orb to make up for its average attacking stats. When coupled with damage from status conditions and entry hazard damage, Life Orb recoil can add up quickly and severely shorten Greninja's lifespan.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Pokemon with high special bulk and/or Assault Vest can sponge most of Greninja's special attacks and wear it down or outright KO it. Blissey, Chansey, Clefable, Cresselia, Goodra, Ferrothorn, and Tentacruel are common examples of such Pokemon, although the first three are the only ones that can reliably switch into Greninja without the fear of getting worn down by a super effective hit.

**Bulky Attackers**: There are Pokemon that resist most of Greninja's most commonly used moves, possibly survive attacks reserved specifically for them, and hit back hard. Keldeo and Mega Venusaur resist all of Greninja's most commonly used moves bar Extrasensory and can hit back with their STAB attacks. Assault Vest Conkeldurr can shrug off most of Greninja's attacks and either heal itself with Drain Punch or attack with Mach Punch. However, like Keldeo and Mega Venusaur, it must watch out for Extrasensory. Furthermore, Kyurem, Kyurem-B, Azumarill, and Mega Gyarados are all naturally bulky and can tank most of Greninja's usual attacks.

**Faster Attackers**: Greninja is very vulnerable to revenge killing, though its Water typing means that it resists Bullet Punch and Ice Shard when it switches in. The most reliable way to revenge kill it besides using Choice Scarf Pokemon or naturally faster Pokemon such as Deoxys-S and Jolteon is with powerful priority users. Assuming Greninja does not change into a type that resists a particular priority attack, Talonflame, Scizor, Entei, Dragonite, Absol, Bisharp, and Conkeldurr are able to deal hefty damage or OHKO it with their respective priority moves. Thundurus can be included in this grouping as well, as it can paralyze Greninja with Prankster Thunder Wave and leave it crippled for the rest of the match.
