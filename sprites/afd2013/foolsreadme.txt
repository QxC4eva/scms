We also have five messages displayed when you use Taunt:
  "Yo mama so fat, she 4x resists Ice- and Fire-type attacks!"
  "Yo mama so ugly, Captivate raises her opponent's Special Attack!"
  "Yo mama so dumb, she lowers her Special Attack when she uses Nasty
   Plot!"
  "Yo mama so fat, Smogon switched to Pokemon Showdown because PO had
   an integer overflow bug when you used Grass Knot against her!"
  "Yo mama so dumb, she thought Sylveon would be Light Type!"

Earthquake would also show up as Fissure and the say 'just kidding X used Earthquake'
