Overview
########
- Defiant is pretty great since it prevents common Intimidate Pokemon like Landorus-T from switching in.
- Knock Off buff also works in its favor by making it harder to switch into.
- High Attack + Good STAB combo is frightening.
- Has middling speed though.
- Sucker Punch helps it get around faster Pokemon to make up for this.
- Is also weak to common attacking types like Fighting, Fire, and Ground.
- All in all a great Pokemon.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Protect
ability: Defiant
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Sucker Punch is for use against threats that would otherwise be faster or to beat slower mons with priority.
- Iron Head is a nice secondary STAB, hits most threats for good damage as well as hittin things like Tyranitar and Togekiss for super effective. 
- Knock Off is good because it's more reliable than Sucker Punch, hits harder, and makes the opponent lose their item
- Protect shields you from super effective moves and such to prevent a KO. Even more useful on Bisharp since it's fairly frail.

Set Details
========
- Life Orb is a great choice to increase Bisharp's already great power and make it even more threatening.
- EVs let Bisharp have as much power as possible while still having a decent Speed, since the bulk isn't too important.
- Adamant is for a better damage output since you don't need the speed provided by Jolly.
- Defiant lets you get a free boost off of stat droppers like Intimidate and Icy Wind, making Bisharp very threatening to Pokemon with those type of things.
- Low Kick could be used over Iron Head to hit Heatran but other than that Iron Head is better.
- Swords Dance can be used to make it much more threatening with +2 STAB priority and the inability to have its stat boosts stripped by Intimidate.
- These moves are generally the standard on Bisharp though, and wavering from them can lower overall effectiveness.

Usage Tips
========
- Is a nice trick room check since it hits most setters super effectively before they can use Trick Room
- Use Sucker Punch to pick off faster but frail threats
- When you outspeed a Pokemon and you want to use a Dark-type attack, use Knock Off since Sucker Punch can be played around.
- If you have other Pokemon who don't like having their attack dropped by Intimidate, use Bisharp to try and scare the opponent from bringing in their Intimidator.
- Try to avoid letting this thing take much damage since its pretty frail and its frailness plus Life Orb recoil will add up.
- Another reason to keep it alive is that it makes for a very good late-game cleaner.
- Generally, Knock Off is the go to attack for Bisharp. sucker punch is for things that can outspeed you, and iron head is for things that resist knock off, or if the opponent has no item but you dont want to/dont need to risk sucker punch failing. protect is just for when you need to shield bisharp from unwanted damage, since it isn't hard to KO

Team Options
========
- Strong physical attackers such as Tyranitar or Landorus-T will appreciate bisharp dealing with Intimidate pokemon
- Psychic, Fairy, or Ghost-types such as Follow Me Togekiss or Cresselia can take Fighting-type hits for Bisharp.
- Slower pokemon such as Amoonguss will appreciate Bisharp's ability to check faster threats with Sucker Punch.
- Faster pokemon such as Terrakion will like Bisharp being able to KO most Trick Room setters.
- Partners that can tank/redirect powerful hits for Bisharp like Togekiss or Amoonguss are good to have.
- Speed control from Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Cresselia, or Togekiss is pretty useful, since Bisharp is even more threatening when it doesnt need to rely on sucker punch for faster threats.

Other Options
########

- Due to the amount of switches it forces it can run Substitute, which also lets it dodge Will-o-Wisp
- Choice Band is nice to have a huge amount of power, but being locked into a move is a pain. 
- Focus Sash is nice since Bisharp has many weaknesses and isn't too bulky
- Lum Berry can be used to get rid of problematic burns, but other items are usually more useful.
- Psycho Cut to lure in and hit Fighting-types for SE damage.
- Taunt for slower mons that think they could hit it with status or still use support moves.
- Pursuit could be interesting to pick off a mon that thinks it can just switch out.
- Choice Scarf to surprise those expecting a slower set with a powerful hit before they move.

Checks & Counters
########

- Fighting types like Terrakion and Conkeldurr will mess up Bisharp with their STAB moves
- Mach punch from Breloom and Conkeldurr especially are threatening since it will KO Bisharp before it can use an Iron Head.
- Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Volcarona will all mess up Bisharp with STAB Fire moves but can have trouble switching in.
- Scarf Tyranitar can outspeed and use Low Kick to KO.
- Burns will make Bisharp a lot weaker, although Bisharp can actually threaten most burn users with a large chunk of damage.
- Garchomp can outspeed, live through sucker punch, and ko with Earthquake making it a nice check.
- Opposing Bisharp with Low Kick, Mega Gyarados, and Keldeo all resist both of its STABs and hit it back for a lot of damage.
- Something with Substitute to be able to play around Sucker Punch can work situationally.
