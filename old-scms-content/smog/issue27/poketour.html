<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome  one and all to the latest installment of Pok&eacute;Tour. Our last  trip in Fortree City had us aching to find those cities with both the  splendors of the city along with the touch of nature that can rarely be  found in the average location. Fellow tourist Birkal quipped on never  having a chance to visit Kanto, and with Fuchsia City and its renowned  wildlife, we chartered a course straight for its luscious beaches.  Meeting us up on the tour, Lady Salamence joined us after a visit to  Ilex Forest. As a welcoming gift, she offered us some of the local Ilex  Forest produce. Being a picky eater, I looked over some of the onions  and remarked, "LS, these onions look rancid." She retorted, "No, Layell,  they are perfectly fresh". Still dubious, I picked out the greenest one  and it wasn't an onion at all; it was a Celebi! Shocked, the little  green fairy activated its time-travel abilities and sent my companions  across time. I looked around the empty bus. "You're going to help me  find my time traveling pals, aren't you?" The little fairy nodded,  looking ever guilty for causing this mayhem. Looking over my notes,  Jellicent was supposed to write on culture, Birkal on music, Lady  Salamence on Architecture, Superpowerdude on the competitive scene, and  I, Layell... was supposed to wash the van...</p>

<p>It can stay dirty for another trip; I need to find these guys before we have to leave again!</p>

<h2>Birkal on Music</h2>

<p>One  minute, Superpowerdude, Lady Salamence, and I were eating some  delectable veggies on the Pok&eacute;Tour bus; the next, we were  standing outside in Fuchsia City. Layell had been complaining about  onions, but now he was no where to be seen. Even more distressing, the  last I had seen of Jellicent, he was sawing logs in the back of the bus.  Lord knows where he was now... I shrugged to myself; for now, I've got  some tunes to listen to!</p>

<p>As we appeared in the  city, a cutesy Lydian scale in A performed by some tinkling bells  heralded our arrival. It lead into a chipper theme in the key of E major  that was mostly scalar in tonality. An energetic brass section filled  out the arrangement nicely with some peppy off-beat cues and digs. They  were of particular note towards the end of the A theme, where they come  in charging on beat one for a rapid flurry of sixteenth notes. The  rhythm section of syncopated keyboard taps and slap bass drive the theme  with plenty of enthusiasm, while also clearly outlining the I to V43  progression of the A theme. The B section of the city's theme brought it  down low, as indicated by the percussion switching to rim shots on the  snare and the diminuendo of the brass section. Of particular note here  is the beautiful french horn harmonization that soars above the main  theme. Although its time in the spotlight is short, it is a thing of  beauty. And of course, a flourish of the drums on the fourth measure  gives way to the bright downbeat of the A theme returning once again to  regale us.</p>

<h2>Superpowerdude on The Competitive Scene</h2>

<div class="panel-speaker spd">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue23/poketour_superpowerdude.png" alt="Superpowerdude" />
<p>I  was eager to visit Fuchsia City, with thoughts of going to the Safari  Zone and catching some new Pokémon racing through my mind. Now that we  were suddenly there, my heart was pumping as I got closer and closer to a  big building located north of the city. A man greeted me at the  entrance with a smile on his face and said, "Hello! Welcome to the Pal  Park." I was shattered to find out that the Safari Zone is not in  Fuchsia City, despite the backpacker I met earlier telling me it was.  Unfortunately, I couldn't catch any Pokémon in this 'Pal Park'; however,  I could bring some of my Pokémon I left at Hoenn along with me on my  journey via the Pal Park, so that was quite helpful.</p>

<p>As  I was wandering out of the Pal Park, a juggler caught my eye. He told  me that he was willing to trade some berries if I brought him some  shards. I gladly took the trade so I could get rid of those annoying  shards that were weighing down my backpack and get some berries for my  Pokémon to use.</p>

<p>I looked around the rest of  the city, and while it was pleasing to look at, it didn't have much to  offer for battle-loving trainers like myself. So, I decided to test my  battling skills by entering the city's Pokémon gym. I heard that Janine  (Fuchsia City's Gym Leader) was a very strong trainer, so I was excited  to challenge her. Upon walking into the gym, I got very frustrated.  There seemed to be multiple Janines! I didn't know which one to  challenge. Also, the fact that the gym had invisible walls made it very  hard for me to challenge the trainers&mdash;or should I say  imposters! After finally finding and beating Janine, I received TM84,  Poison Jab.</p>

<h2>Lady Salamence on Architecture</h2>

<div class="panel-speaker ls">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue27/poketour_ls.png" alt="Lady Salamence" />
<p>As  I walked onto the reddish path that, in my opinion, defines the city  known as Fuchsia, I was immediately pleased with my first  Pok&eacute;Tour assignment. The city was beautiful, from the path to  the houses; even the little touches such as the street lamps and the  flowers contributed to how beautiful this city is. The strange layout  (you can't reach the Pokémon Center without going around a giant rock  and an impassible ledge? What's up with the rock anyway?) and the fact  it's rather out of the way doesn't help its case, but the Gym Leader  gives you a pink heart if you win. I have no complaints.</p>

<p>While  I could rave about this city for decades on how pretty it is, I'm  supposed to be discussing the architecture. Fuchsia is a very  interesting case, as there are only four houses, completely different  from one another aside for two which are identical. Sure, there's the  Gym, Pokémon Center, and Pokémart, but those designs should be etched  into every Pokémon Master's head.</p>

<p>The  identical houses have an interesting setup that makes me think they  aren't houses, but used for another purpose, such as greenhouses or for a  (Pokémon) daycare, mainly due to its pink roof and apparent lack of  doors when I tried to figure out how to get in. One house, it would  seem, comes directly from a western town&mdash;cream roof and  brownish exterior, especially the way it's set up. The other house makes  me think it's the Gym Leader's house just by neighboring the Gym and  its scary demeanor, which may be due only to the red roof. Regardless,  the gym creeps me out, and now I want to go home... Where are the people  that came with me...?</p>

<h2>Jellicent on Culture</h2>

<div class="panel-speaker jellicent">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue20/poketour_jell.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>As  I woke and stretched out, I noticed I was no longer on the  Pok&eacute;Tour bus. Had I wandered off drunkenly again? I looked  around and spotted a sign the said Fuchsia City. Perfect, this is where  our next assignment was anyway! Glancing down at my Pok&eacute;tch, I  realized we were only supposed to be here for another hour. Shit, I'd  have to move fast. I jumped up, rushed into the first house I saw, and  quickly inquired who they all were. Relatives of Bill... I did a 180 and  ran out. Don't tell anyone, but I've been storing my Pok&eacute;mon  on his PC for ages. It's his fault for not password-protecting the  Wi-Fi. The Gym was next door, so I tried there. Unfortunately, the Gym  Leader was really into houses of glass and I had no time for his carny  mind games.</p>

<p>The city's layout could not have  been more confusing for a man on the run. I could see the  Pok&eacute;Mart, but without Cut, it might as well have been miles  away. I found a pair of identical houses and hustled into the one on the  right. Some guy handed me a fishing pole and offered to let me fish out  back. "Thanks, but I gotta go," I replied, rushing off with the rod.  The other house contained an old, possibly-drunken man sloshing out  incoherent phrases. This was the Safari Zone warden? I left him  slobbering on himself and headed north. Outside of the Safari Zone was a  giant zoo, which itself is kinda like a Safari Zone where you're not  allowed to catch anything, aka pointless. Spotting an item ball in one  of the enclosures, I figured I at least had time to reel in something  rare and cast out my line. Electricity instantly pulsed through my veins  and suddenly made me feel both dead and very alive. Why is it always a  Voltorb? Who puts a Voltorb in a zoo? If that's the kind of  Pok&eacute;mon they find exotic, the Safari Zone can not be worth  the 500 Pok&eacute;Dollars.</p>

<p>The closest  building harbored a group of Safari Zone employees shooting the breeze.  Apparently, they refer to the warden as "Slowpoke" because of his vacant  appearance. One of the workers seemed troubled that Slowpoke had a  speech problem. I reassured him that it sounded more like a drinking  problem and headed back outside. Pulling out my Pok&eacute;gear, I  dialed up Birkal. "Yeah, you can come pick me up. What? It's me,  Jelli... You know, Jellicent... Come on, man, we've been traveling  around the world together writing about culture and music for ages...  Yeah, it does sound like a cool idea; that's why we did it... Are you  having memory loss or something? Just get in the bus, find a guy called  Jellicent, and we can get back to touring the world... Alright, see you  soon, I hope..."</p>

<p>Looking back down at my Pok&eacute;tch, I noticed what year it was. Had I slept backwards in time!?</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Luckily  for Birkal, Superpowerdude, and Lady Salamence, they had only been  transported a few hours into the future. Layell and Celebi came rolling  up in the filthy bus not long after they appeared in Fuchsia City. A  drunken, yammering Jellicent soon wandered over to the bus and joined  them as well. With everyone reunited once more, Celebi flew back towards  Ilex Forest.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what  Jellicent was doing there, well... he waited. He waited a long, long  time. During his stay in Fuchsia, his boisterous late-night antics were  enough to drive Koga and the Warden out of the city. Anyway, we here at  Pok&eacute;Tour hope to see you all again sometime soon. Until then,  we've got some traveling to do!</p>
