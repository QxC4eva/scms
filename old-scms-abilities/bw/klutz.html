[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder is unaffected by its held itemsâ€”both their positive and negative effects. The Speed-halving effects of <a href="/bw/items/macho_brace">Macho Brace</a>, Power Anklet, Power Band, Power Belt, Power Brace, Power Lens, and Power Weight are still applied, as are the effects of Lucky Egg, Exp. Share, and Amulet Coin.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Klutz is a pretty poor ability with only a few gimmicky strategies that can be used alongside it. The only Pokemon that receives Klutz that can really make use of it is <a href="/bw/pokemon/lopunny">Lopunny</a>, as it has no other useful ability available to it. What's more, Lopunny has access to one major move that makes Klutz somewhat usable: <a href="/bw/moves/switcheroo">Switcheroo</a>. With Switcheroo, Lopunny is able to keep an item which would normally be crippling, such as <a href="/bw/item/flame_orb">Flame Orb</a> or <a href="/bw/item/lagging_tail">Lagging Tail</a>, hidden from the opponent, and then to use Switcheroo to give it to the opponent at the most opportune moment.</p>
