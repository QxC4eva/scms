[SHORT DESC]
Increases power of moves with secondary effects by 30%, but removes the effects.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder uses an attack with a secondary effect, the power of that attack is multiplied by 5325/4096 (about 130%) and the secondary effect is ignored. Recoil, user stat penalties, increased critical hit ratio, perfect accuracy, and variable-power attacks are primary effects and so moves with these effects are not boosted by Sheer Force. Moves with both a primary and secondary effect (such as <a href="/bw/moves/flare_blitz">Flare Blitz</a>) will still gain the power increase, but the secondary ability is negated and the primary ability still takes place (in the case of Flare Blitz, the 10% burn rate is negated, but the user still takes recoil from increased power).</p>

<p>Sheer Force has a load of strange side-effects and interesting quirks. For example, Meloetta cannot transform with Relic Song if it has Sheer Force (via an ability-changing effect, such as <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a>). Sheer Force also negates the effects of items that occur after damage, such as <a href="/bw/items/red_card">Red Card</a> or <a href="/bw/items/eject_button">Eject Button</a> on the defending Pokemon, and <a href="/bw/items/shell_bell">Shell Bell</a> or <a href="/bw/items/life_orb">Life Orb</a> recoil on the attacking Pokemon, so long as the attack used has a secondary effect. It also negates the effects of the ability <a href="/bw/abilities/color_change">Color Change</a> on the defending Pokemon, so long as the attack used has a secondary effect.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The negation of Life Orb recoil has turned Sheer Force into a destructive ability. Boosting common moves such as <a href="/bw/moves/flamethrower">Flamethrower</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/ice_beam">Ice Beam</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/thunderbolt">Thunderbolt</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/fire_blast">Fire Blast</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/crunch">Crunch</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/earth_power">Earth Power</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/focus_blast">Focus Blast</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/sludge_wave">Sludge Wave</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/waterfall">Waterfall</a>, Sheer Force can turn previously unimpressive Pokemon into powerhouse sweepers. <a href="/bw/pokemon/nidoking">Nidoking</a> has a wide movepool and <a href="/bw/pokemon/rampardos">Rampardos</a> has sky-high Attack, just to give some examples of what can use Sheer Force effectively.</p>
