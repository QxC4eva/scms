<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 20% chance to confuse the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There is virtually no reason to use this move. The 17% overall confusion probability is not worth the 85% accuracy or the power drop compared to Return, Frustration, or Double-Edge. Tauros is a notable exception, due to Sheer Force boosting its Base Power to 117, making it stronger than Return and sporting no recoil unlike Double-Edge.</p>
