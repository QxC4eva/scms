<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bide is a three-turn attack and has a priority of +1 on each turn. The last Pokemon to hit the user with a damaging attack, even if zero damage was dealt, is dealt damage on the third turn equal to double the sum of the HP lost by the user whenever it was damaged by a move from another Pokemon during the turns Bide's effect was active. This damage is fixed, and the move ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers. If the user is prevented from using this attack, inflicted with sleep or freeze status, or is switched out the effects of this move will end permanently.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Bide is not an especially useful move competitively, in that, should the opponent not attack directly, they gain two turns of completely free setup. Also, if they are able to 2HKO, this attack will fail to deal any damage. However, in some respects, this move is more reliable than Counter and Mirror Coat, since it does not require you to predict whether the opponent will use a physical or special attack, and there is nothing immune to it. If you do decide to use Bide, make sure to use it on a very bulky Pokemon with at least moderately high HP; it also must be ensured that this Pokemon is to be attacked directly, for instance through the use of Taunt, rather than being set up on.</p>
