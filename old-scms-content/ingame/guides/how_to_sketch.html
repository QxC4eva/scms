<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>For all of the people who opened this article hoping to learn how to draw, sorry to upset you. Instead this is an in-depth look into the move Sketch and its uses.</p>

<p>Sketch is a move that allows the user to permanently learn the last move used by its target. Smeargle learns Sketch at Levels 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91, but it can only know 1 Sketch at a time.</p>

<p>This is one of the most interesting moves in the game, and it's exclusive to Smeargle. Not only does it allow for Smeargle to have an infinite number of movesets, but it also makes him the best male parent for the Ground Egg Group. The latter earns Smeargle almost as much action in the Day Care as Ditto.</p>

<h2><a name="methods">Methods for Sketching</a></h2>

<h3><a name="endurance">Endurance Method</a></h3>

<p>The Endurance Method is the most painful method, because it involves waiting for a wild Pokemon to use a move that you want to  Sketch. Due to Smeargle's frailty, it is suggested that the item Focus Sash be used when doing this. There are two main sub-divisions of this method, Stalling and Move Trapping.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stall</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Find ways to waste Smeargle's turn, such as using items (like  X-Defense or other stat boosters), until the desired move is  used.</li>
<li>Once the desired move is used, have Smeargle use Sketch. To  effectively use this method, Smeargle must be faster than the opponent  in order to guarantee a successful Sketch.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Move Trapping</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Start off with a Pokemon that knows either Switcheroo, Trick, or Encore. Use Switcheroo or Trick to give the opponent a Choice item  and lock them into a single move. However, this can sometimes be  unreliable, because you never know which move the wild Pokemon will use.  For this reason, it is often better to use a fast Pokemon with Encore  in order to trap the opponent into their move after they have used  it.</li>
<li>Switch Smeargle in and use Sketch. Note that Smeargle will  have to be able to take at least one hit from the move when switching  in, although hopefully you are using a Focus Sash, just in  case.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="wild">Wild Smeargle Method</a></h3>

<p>The Wild Smeargle Method involves leading with a Pokemon that  knows the move you want and finding a wild Smeargle.</p>

<ol>
<li>Using a Pokemon with the move you want as the lead, attack the  wild Smeargle with the move. Note that you must be faster. The wild  Smeargle has no choice but to Sketch the move.</li>
<li>Switch to your own Smeargle, remembering that you must be able  to take whatever attack the wild Smeargle now knows. Use your own  Sketch to copy the move on the following turn.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Generation III</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>E:</strong> The Artisan Cave at the Battle Frontier. 100% Smeargle encounter rate.</li>
<li><strong>RS/FRLG:</strong> Smeargle is not found in the wild in any of these games.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Generation IV</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>DP:</strong> Route 212 (North end), using the PokeRadar. Level 17 - 18.</li>
<li><strong>Pt:</strong> Route 208, using PokeRadar. Level 18 - 20. Route 212 (North end), using the PokeRadar. Level 24 - 26.</li>
<li><strong>HGSS:</strong> In the grass at the Ruins of Alph. Level 20 - 22.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="double">Double Battle Method</a></h3>

<p>The Double Battle Method is perhaps the most reliable and  predictable of all the methods, and should be the main focus of effort.  It involves having both Smeargle and a Pokemon with the move you want.  Any Double Battle can work to this end, as long as the player has  control of two Pokemon. Again, due to Smeargle's frailty, it is  suggested that the item Focus Sash be used when doing this.</p>

<ol>
<li>First place Smeargle and a Pokemon with the desired move as the two leads to your party.</li>
<li>Using the Pokemon with the move you want, select the move you wish to Sketch.</li>
<li>If the Smeargle is faster, use any method to use its turn so  that it doesn't use Sketch, while the other Pokemon uses the move you  want to Sketch. Using items is a nice way to waste Smeargle's turn  (again, stat boosters are a recommended example). Have Smeargle use  Sketch the next turn. If the Smeargle is slower, simply use both the  move and Sketch during the same turn.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Generation III</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>RSE:</strong> The Traveling Reporters cycle through Route 111, Route 118, and Route 120.</li>
<li><strong>E:</strong> Gym Leaders will double battle after the Elite Four is defeated.</li>
<li><strong>FRLG:</strong> Several couples througout the game can be rebattled  with the Vs. Seeker. The Young Couple north of where a Snorlax was  sleeping on Route 12 is suggested.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Generation IV</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>DPP:</strong> The Double Battle Diner, on Valor Lakefront, hosts five double battles a day.</li>
<li><strong>DPP:</strong> Many paired trainers throughout the game can be rebattled with the VS Seeker.
<ul>
<li>Route 209 just south of Solaceon Town, hosts two possible  double battles, with an easily accessible one at the north  end.</li>
<li>Route 204, just south of Floaroma Town, there are a pair of twins that only have a Pachirisu apiece.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>HGSS:</strong> To rebattle trainers in HG/SS, one must call them on the PokeGear.
<ul>
<li>Route 15 has a pair of twins that can be rebattled on Saturday from 8pm - 5am.</li>
<li>Route 13 has a couple that can be rebattled on Friday from 10am - 8pm</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="secret">Secret Base Method</a></h3>

<p>The Secret Base Method is a special method to use Sketch that  can only be used in Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald.</p>

<ol>
<li>In a cartridge different than the one your Smeargle is on,  delete all of a Pokemon's moves but the one you want Sketched, and mix  records with the game with Smeargle. Make sure the cartridge you mix  with has an easily accessible Secret Base.</li>
<li>Battle the trainer from the other cartridge. Sketching should  be easy for Smeargle because the opponent only has one move it can  use.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="multiple">Sketching Multiple Moves</a></h2>

<p>When Sketching more than one move, you'll need a way to return  the move Sketch to your Smeargle. While Smeargle can only know 1 Sketch  at a time, after you have Sketched one move onto Smeargle, it can learn  Sketch again. If you do not feel like leveling Smeargle up, you can have  Smeargle relearn Sketch via the Move Relearner.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RSE:</strong>  The Move Relearner is found in Fallarbor Town and costs 1 Heart Scale per use.</li>
<li><strong>FRLG:</strong>  The Move Relearner is found on Two Island and costs 2 TinyMushrooms or 1 Big Mushroom per use.</li>
<li><strong>DPPt:</strong>  The Move Relearner is found in Pastoria City and costs 1 Heart Scale per use.</li>
<li><strong>HGSS:</strong> The Move Relearner is found in Blackthorn City and costs 1 Heart Scale per use.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="special">Special Ways to Sketch</a></h2>

<p>Moves that make the user faint or switch out require special  care to Sketch, as the user of the desired move must not faint and  remain out in order for Sketch to be successful. The trick to Sketching  these moves is knowing how to make them fail or how to prevent the user  from switching out, whichever the case may be.</p>

<h3><a name="status">R/S: Status and Sketch</a></h3>

<p>In Ruby and Sapphire, whenever a move is selected, it counts as being used. This counts even when a Pokemon is asleep, frozen, or fully  paralyzed. This allows you to Sketch all moves with extreme ease and bypass any special methods that may be required. This can only be used  in conjunction with the Double Battle Method.</p>

<h3><a name="moves">Lunar Dance / Healing Wish / U-turn / Baton Pass</a></h3>

<p>In order to make these moves fail or fail to cause the user to  switch out, there must be no suitable switches on your team. Thus, the  only way they can be Sketched in a Double Battle is by having the only  usable Pokemon in your party be the ones that are already in the battle.  Using the move in this situation will cause the move to fail because  there is no suitable replacement. The move can then be Sketched as  normal with the Double method.</p>

<h3><a name="sacrifice_moves">Explosion / Selfdestruct</a></h3>

<p>There are two main methods to Sketch Explosion and  Selfdestruct. Both can only be performed in a Double Battle.</p>

<p>The most reliable and highly recommended method is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bring your own Pokemon with the ability Damp (Psyduck,  Golduck, Poliwag, Poliwhirl, Poliwrath, Politoed, Wooper, Quagsire), and a  Pokemon with Explosion. Use Explosion on the first turn, and waste the  Damper's turn however you see fit.</li>
<li>Switch the Damp Pokemon out for your Smeargle, while wasting the Exploder's turn by using an item.</li>
<li>If your Smeargle is faster, Sketch your Exploder and it  doesn't matter what the other Pokemon does. If your Smeargle is slower,  waste the Exploder's turn once again, and Sketch the  Exploder.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second method involves knowing your opponent has a Damp  Pokemon ahead of time, and treating Explosion as a regular move using  the Double method. While faster in-battle, this requires more work. This  is the only option for low-level Smeargle, unless the Exploder also  knows Follow Me.</p>

<h3><a name="memento">Memento</a></h3>

<p>The move Memento causes the user to faint, and there is no ability which causes it to fail. However, the move can be forced to fail in one of two ways: if it has no target, or if the Memento user falls victim to Taunt.</p>

<h4>Taunt Method</h4>

<ol>
<li>Bring your own Pokemon with Taunt, and a Pokemon with Memento.  The Taunter must be faster. Use Memento the first turn, while using  Taunt on the Memento user. Memento will fail, but will still count as  being used.</li>
<li>Switch the Taunter out for your Smeargle, while wasting the Memento user's turn by using an item.</li>
<li>If your Smeargle is faster, Sketch Memento and it won't matter  what the Pokemon does. If your Smeargle is slower, waste the Memento  user's turn once again while Smeargle uses Sketch.</li>
</ol>

<h4>No Target Method</h4>

<ol>
<li>Bring a Pokemon that can KO two opponents simultaneously, and a  Pokemon with Memento. You must be able to KO both of the opponents'  Pokemon before Memento can be used. Blizzard, Discharge, Earthquake,  Explosion, Eruption, Heat Wave, Muddy Water, Rock Slide, Selfdestruct,  Surf, and Water Spout are all powerful moves that hit both opponents.  Note that Discharge, Earthquake, Explosion, Selfdestruct, and Surf will  also hit your other Pokemon, so be prepared. If both the opponents are  KOed, then Memento will have no target and fail.</li>
<li>Switch out for your Smeargle, while wasting the Memento user's turn by using an item.</li>
<li>If your Smeargle is faster, Sketch Memento and it won't matter  what the Pokemon does. If your Smeargle is slower, waste the Memento  user's turn once again while Smeargle uses Sketch.</li>
</ol>

<p>A powerful Pokemon with Explosion or Selfdestruct (Metagross,  Licklicky, Azelf, Snorlax) and a Ghost-type with Memento (Spiritomb,  Misdreavus, Duskull, Drifloon) work very well for this method. And as a  bonus, the switching-in doesn't cost a turn.</p>
