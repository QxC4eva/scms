[SHORT DESC]
Lowers target's Special Attack by 1 stage.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 100% chance to lower the target's Special Attack by one stage. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Snarl is not a very useful move; it is essentially a Dark-type Icy Wind that lowers Special Attack instead of Speed. While the Speed drop that Icy Wind provides is occasionally useful (especially in VGC play), a Special Attack drop is nowhere near as helpful. Try finding more useful support and attacking options before using Snarl; it usually isn't very hard.</p>
