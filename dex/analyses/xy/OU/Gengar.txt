Overview
########
Gengar is a rather interesting choice in XY OU. Its stats are not impressive; a rather generic frail specially offensive build with a good speed tier remeniscent of mediocre pokemon such as Espeon, or Azelf. However its allure lies in a wide offensive and utility movepool as well as useful typing and  ability that grant excellent STAB, a number of handy 4x resistances, and three immunities. These  attributes render Gengar very unpredictable, offensively threatening and challenging to play around. Gengar is a Pokemon that can fit on nearly any team, adapting to any play style the opponent may use.

Moves
========

Destiny Bond is what seperates Gengar from other frail all out specially offensive attackers such as Greninja. Destiny Bond lets Gengar take a defensive check or counter down with it allowing it to wall break against ghost counters and always pull its weight. Shadow Ball is Gengar's primary offensive move, only Dark-types and Normal-types have an advantageous match up to it, and these pokemon are few. Though its 80 base power is disappointing, with a Life Orb it really stings being capable of 2HKOing a large portion of the tier. Focus Blast is extremely valauble to Gengar, it confers super effective coverage against the few Ghost-type resists in OU such as Tyranitar. Sludge Bomb or Sludge Wave is a secondary STAB move that gives Gengar a bit more power  against neutral targets, as well as some useful super effective coverage against Fairy-types. Sludge Wave has the ability to hit Chesnaught and has an iota more power, while Sludge Bomb's poison chance  is useful to hassling switch ins. Thunderbolt is a useful move in the final slot that achieves a convincing 2HKO on Mandibuzz who otherwise causes issue to Gengar. Thunderbolt has more numerous super effective targets in comparison to Sludge Wave as well. Finally Taunt is something  that can be considered in the last slot. It is useful for stopping a Pokemon that is trying to play around Destiny Bond with status moves, as well it can let Gengar beat some very passive defensive  threats like Chansey. 


Set Details
========

The EV spread is simple and optimal. Gengar has pitiful defenses, and requires maximized offenses to function as an attacker. A Timid nature is compulsory to exceed the large positive natured base 100 speed tier. Life Orb is necessary conferring far too much power to pass up and the recoil is of little concern to such a frail Pokemon. 


Usage Tips
========

This is Gengar's best set at fighting offensive teams being nearly impossible to switch into for  them. Should your team need a better match up to offense this set will perform well. That being said  Destiny Bond ensures that Gengar will also thrive against heavy defenses. Some utilities Destiny Bond is capable of is counterplay to Sucker Punch users. Destiny Bond will move last against them thus forcing them to either lose to Destiny Bond next turn or move last, giving you a safe turn to attack. Destiny Bond also ignores Substitute, therefore Gengar can be used to revenge kill slower attackers behind substitutes. Fighting, Normal, and Ground-type  moves can be switched into of course, but the opponent must be pressured into usng them! If an opposing Terrakion is facing something that does not threaten it at all its unlikely to use Close  Combat when Gengar is alive. Pressuring the opponent into using moves Gengar is immune to is most  easily achieved by boosting with teammates, then relenquishing these boosts for momentum when the  opponent switches in a counter that uses Ground or Fighting type moves.


Team Options
========

For many teams Aegislash is a go to check for Gengar using its Shadow Sneak to KO. Bisharp is a  marvelous partner to Gengar being able to switch in on Shadow Sneak and use Pursuit to trap and Kill  Aegislash. Bisharp is also capable of pressuring the opponent into using Fighting-type or Ground-type attacks for Gengar to switch in on. Mandibuzz is also a reasonable Aegislash switch in for more  defensively oriented teams. Mega Venusaur with the right moves handles a number of priority abusing  checks to Gengar such as Azumarill, and Scizor, as well as pokemon naturally faster than Gengar such  as Thundurus and Manectric. Venusaur also absorbs Knock Off targeted at Gengar without any issue. Stealth Rock support is incredibly useful to Gengar as not only does it let Gengar break through the opponent easier, but it deters Talonflame and Mega Pinsir from using their strong priority to check it. This goes a long way to persuading the opponent into using slower Pokemon that can tank a hit from Gengar and OHKO back such as Keldeo, to check, which then makes Destiny Bond far more effective. 


Other Options
########

Gengar has a couple of miscellaneous coverage options but these moves have limited application.  Dazzling Gleam may seem appealing as Ghost and Fairy in tandem achieve good neutral Coverage, however  Dazzling Gleam is pathetically weak against Relevant Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Bisharp.  Psychic hits a small number of Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Scolipede and Keldeo for big damage but  there's usually not enough room for it on any set. Energy Ball OHKO 4x weak targets such as Gastrodon  and does little otherwise.  A Choice Specs set thanks to Gengar's coverage and the lack of resistances  to just Ghost-type moves may seem appealing, however it requires a hell of a lot of support to  function. Hung out to dry against pursuit and sucker punch users outside of trick, as well as any  strong priority or choice scarf user in general make it quite easy to check. Thanks to Gengar's poor  bulk it really just can't switch in enough to make a large mark on the opponent. Despite these  failings it can beat pretty much every counter with coverage, or trick and the power behind Specs  makes it very hard to switch into. Overall it is inefficient compared to the other sets.

Checks & Counters
########

**Tyranitar**: Tyranitar has been one of Gengar's greatest enemies for a long time. It resists  Gengar's STAB moves, receives a massive special defense stat thanks to Sand Stream, and it traps it with a strong Pursuit. Despite this Focus Blast is quite threatening to Tyranitar, Life Orb Gengar  OHKOs max HP variant of Tyranitar, however the tables turn in Tyranitar's  favor if it runs a max  Special Defense spread as Focus Blast fails to KO, while Crunch destroys Gengar. The assault vest set  is so beefy that a Focus Blast from Gengar that lacks a boosting item can not even 2HKO it.

**Chansey / Blissey**: These two wall all sets, and cripple with Thunder Wave, however they can lose to cleverly played Utility Attacker sets, as well as to Destiny Bond.

**Pursuit Users**: Scizor, Escavalier, Bisharp, and Tyranitar are all capable of trapping with Pursuit, though the right coverage moves from Gengar as well as Will-O-Wisp can deter them.

**Assault Vest users**: Conkeldurr, Escavalier, Tyranitar, and more Assault Vest users really ruin Gengar's day, unless they can be 2HKO'd Gengar is fighting a losing battle. 

**Strong Choice scarf users**: Garchomp, Terrakion, Landorus-T, and what have you are all quite good  checks to a Gengar that is not behind a substitute as they all cleanly outspeed and KO.

**Strong priority moves**: Scizor, Azumarill, Talonflame, and other pokes like these have no trouble checking Gengar due to its frailty.

**Offensive Pokemon that outspeed it**: Thundurus, Greninja and a number of other Pokemon that outspeed Gengar can easily check it due to Gengar's frailness.

**Paralysis**: Paralysis makes Gengar basically useless, though most can be dodged with Substitute due to Gengar's high speed. However, priority users of Paralysis such as Thundurus and Klefki will force Gengar out if it not already behind a substitute.
