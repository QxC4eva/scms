<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A lot of you may know me as a stall player. At the current time I’ve been seeing a lot of stall teams around and I myself have got sick of playing stall. I wanted to see if Offensive teams were still viable and with my success on the ladder...well you be the judge of that. When you look at my team, you notice 3 things: </p>

<p>1) Every pokemon is immune to toxic spikes. This is huge when I’m facing stall teams.</p>

<p>2) Two pokemon are weak to Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>3) Four pokemon are immune to Spikes.</p>

<p>So the team is pretty good as far as passive damage is concerned. Offensive teams are built on resistances so the player can make switches around the team, so having my pokemon taking minimal passive damage is essential when playing with no walls.. This team can beat all styles of play, but then again it can lose to all styles of play. </p>

<p>I personally have loved playing with offensive teams, the fast paced tempo is great and even though some pokemon involve exploding and revenge killing to beat, that doesn’t mean offensive teams are any worse than others. I want to encourage you all to try offense and the suspect ladder, it’s fun, fast and invigorating.</p>

<p>Anyway, without further adieu, I present to you, the team...</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/376.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Metagross</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Meteor Mash<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Bullet Punch</p>

<p>Metagross is a great lead. There are only two leads which I lose against: Infernape and Heatran. Outside these two, no common lead can OHKO it, hell not many can 2HKO, Metagross is that bulky. I don’t use Aerodactyl because I feel wasting a pokemon just to set up stealth rocks is not a good idea. Against Aerodactyl and Azelf, they only set up stealth rocks, nothing more. If aerodactyl taunts, they get no SR, if he doesnt taunt, I get SR and kill aerodactyl.</p>

<p>One of the best leads in my opinion. If I get a Meteor Mash attack raise Metagross can sweep unsuspecting teams, (I’ve swept 6-0 with this guy alone). To get an idea of his power and bulk, if I get an attack raise from meteor mash, I will outdamage Bronzong , even if he has Earthquake. This guy usually sets up Stealth Rocks and is pretty much guaranteed a KO with explosion if I predict right.</p>

<p>Max attack allows me the possibility of OHKOing Hippowdon with Explosion. Max HP allows me to survive lead Azelfs Fire Blast. Yanmega’s Bug Buzz is a 3HKO as is Aerodactyl's Earthquake.</p>

<p>Metagross lures out Bulky grounds such Hippowdon and Swampert. If these two lead, I just explode right away and forgo Stealth Rocks. These two commonly carry Stealth Rocks themselves, so neither team gets SR, while I eliminate a major threat to my sweepers. As already mentioned, a timely explosion is gamebreaking. In short Metagross is a suicide lead that is meant to last. I emphasise the word “suicide” because Metagross usually ends up exploding to make way for my sweepers to clean up. Metagross’s steel typing also makes it a great switch into draco meteors and outrages.</p>

<p><strong>Gyarados</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 74 HP / 252 Atk / 184 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Bounce</p>

<p>Standard Life Orb set with Leftovers and Bounce. I tried life orb, but Gyarados ended up dying too quickly. Plus it doesn’t push too many 2HKOs into OHKOs in my experience, now that Garchomp has been banned and pokemon are running less special attack and more HP / Defense, unless I use Bounce and life orb, but that is a bad idea as they can stall me out too easily then. If I get a DD, watch out because the opponent will often lose a poke or get significantly weakened. This guy doesn’t always die early and is monstrous late game if their counter has been eliminated.</p>

<p>Max Attack is fairly obvious to deal as much damage as possible. 184 Speed EVs allow me to outspeed base 115s after a DD, notably starmie. The rest is thrown into HP for extra survivability.</p>

<p>Gyarados deals massive damage to most pokemon. A lot of teams rely on scarfers just to take him out so if I can keep chipping away at their counter, a Gyarados sweep becomes very likely. I try to save this guy until late game, where he can clean up.</p>

<p>Electric type attacks aimed at Gyarados should be redirected to....</p>

<p><strong>Latias</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 156 HP / 252 SpA / 100 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Surf<br />
- Recover<br />
- Psycho Shift</p>

<p>Latias’s job is to lure in Scizor and T-tar and nail them with Surf and Draco Meteor. Latias is also useful because it is a great bulky water counter (vaporeon’s Ice Beam doesn’t 2HKO), infernape counter, magnezone counter, just a great switch-in to a lot of special attacking threats in general.</p>

<p>Max Special Attack allows me to score the 2HKO on Scizor and Tyranitar (and some metagross for that matter). I have no idea what the speed EVs are for (I will ask RaikouLover eventually as this is his spread) and some HP EVs allow great survivability against things like Heatran’s HP Ice (which does around 37%).</p>

<p>Latias combos well with Gyarados, beating most of its counters as well as resisting the main type of attack used to defeat it. When playing on the standard ladder I use Flygon here, but I am much more successful with Latias because she takes so little from special threats compared to Flygon. With Recover and Psycho-Shift, Latias should 
last a while.</p>

<p>Bug, Ice and Dark Type attacks aimed at Latias should be directed to....</p>

<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 246 HP / 252 Atk / 12 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- Superpower<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Pursuit</p>

<p>Pretty much just a standard CB set. Scizor is just such a great pokemon. Once I have eliminated the opposing Zapdos / Magnezone / Rotom, scizor can plow through a team with bullet punch alone. Scizor makes a great check to Mamoswine, Weavile and Metagross.</p>

<p>Max attack is obvious for dealing as much damage as possible. 12 Speed Evs allows me to outspeed opposing Scizors and Vaporeon, while the rest is thrown into HP for extra survivability.</p>

<p>Scizor adds some much needed power in priority and takes on Latias / Weavile / Mamoswine (although I must be careful to not switch in to Earthquake). Scizors U-turn allows me to keep myself in control of the battle, while wearing down Scizors counter on the switch. Scizor is a good first switch into blissey with a resistance to thunder-wave and doesn’t care too much about paralysis.</p>

<p><strong>Salamence</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 16 Atk / 240 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>Salamence is the real star of the show. There is only one pokemon that can repeatedly switch in and that is Cresselia. Salamence hardly ever fails to get me a KO, and usually ends up getting 2 or 3. This is, in my opinion the best wall breaker in the game and an invaluable asset. Draco Meteor + Outrage will destroy nearly all walls, while Flamethrower and Earthquake provide coverage on things that resist its STAB.</p>

<p>252 Speed Evs is to at best, tie with opposing base 100s, most notably opposing salamence and zapdos. 240 Special Attack is to boost Draco Meteor, which is my main sweeping move and 16 attack EVs provide a little power to Outrage and Earthquake.</p>

<p>Salamence usually takes out the opposing teams Zapdos, Bulky ground or Rotom (If I switch Salamence into Rotom after a kill, they usually stay in to will-o-wisp). Then scizor can clean up late game. Essentially, salamence should take out at least one pokemon and once that pokemon is gone, one of my pokemon should have an easier time sweeping.</p>

<p><strong>Azelf</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 16 HP / 20 Atk / 252 SpA / 220 Spe<br />
IVs: 29 / 31 / 31 / 31 / 30 / 30<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Hidden Power Ground</p>

<p>Take Deoxyes-S. Take away some speed, and add it to attack and special attack. Throw in Explosion and Flamethrower, while removing Ice Beam and Super Power and you have Azelf. Azelf is mainly here for a fast Special Attacker and an unexpected Explosion. Pretty standard Life Orb set with leftovers to prevent Scizor from OHKOing me with bullet punch after a couple of attacks.</p>

<p>220 Speed EVs lets Azelf outrun base 110’s, 252 Special Attack, because Azelf is primarily a Special Attacker, 16 HP prevents Scizor from OHKOing with bullet punch after Stealth Rock damage (i think) and the rest is placed into attack to boost explosion.</p>

<p>I usually save Azelf until late game. Azelf usually ends up exploding on a key member (like blissey for example), which allows my other sweepers like Latias to clean up. I would consider replacing Azelf with Gengar, for more special attack and because Tyranitar is pretty annoying.</p>
