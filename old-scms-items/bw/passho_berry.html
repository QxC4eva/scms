[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by a Pokemon, reduces the power of a damaging Water-type move that would hit the holder for super effective damage by 50%. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Water-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Though many Pokemon are weak to Water, only a few can competitively use Passho Berry. This item works only once, which greatly reduces its usefulness. Offensive Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon can use this item to absorb a hit from a Water Pokemon and attack back or set up. Note that many Water-weak Pokemon cannot break through many bulky Water-types well even with Passho Berry, therefore it sees very limited competitive use. Typically the Passho Berry is most useful in fast-paced metagames such as VGC, where surviving even one hit can be crucial.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Wild Pansear (5%).</p>
<p>Receive from Fennel on first visit to Dream Worldâ€”however, you only get one of the seventeen damage-reducing Berries, and this event cannot be repeated. If you do not receive a Passho Berry in this way, you must trade for it using Share Shelves in the Dream World.</p>
