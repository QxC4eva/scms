[Overview]

<p>Blastoise would be an above average Pokemon if it weren't for his movepool. Although Blastoise is definitely the weakest of the starters, he can still do very well in UU play.</p>

[SET]
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Surf
move 2: Blizzard
move 3: Body Slam
move 4: Mimic

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>You use him at 100% just like you would at 5%. What does that mean? It means to hit and not hold back. The only exception is Mimic, and that is to help make up for his bad movepool. Mind you, this should only be used if you predict a switch, such as after you switch Blastoise into a Golem/Rhydon Earthquake.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Earthquake can be quite useful against Gengar in OU and Electabuzz in UU. Hydro Pump is a possible replacement for Surf, as with Blastoise's average Special stat he can use all the power he can get. Other possible options include Seismic Toss, Counter, Submission, and Substitute.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Electric-types, Starmie, Chansey, and Lapras all counter Blastoise as they can utilize Thunderbolt and for the most part outspeed Blastoise. With his mediocre Special, Blizzard is only a 3HKO on Zapdos, so it can switch in without worrying too much. Venusaur can also survive two hits unless both are close to max damage, and it is slightly faster than Blastoise, so it can bring him down with Razor Leaf.</p>
