Overview
########
The ability to run two completely different, strong sets with different typings makes Charizard a top-tier threat.
Charizard-Y, the more useful option, makes Sun viable in Doubles, supporting its team greatly in addition to wielding a strong Fire-type STAB. However, its coverage misses out on common threats depending on which attacks it uses.
Charizard-X is a surprising sweeper that can plow Charizard-Y's checks. With a strong, STAB attacks it has no problem spamming with its excellent physical coverage.
While countering Charizard is near impossible, the best way to beat Charizard is through its Speed stat since faster threats can expose its defensive-typing easily.
Mega Charizard-Y
########
name: Mega Charizard-Y
move 1: Heat Wave
move 2: SolarBeam / Focus Blast
move 3: Fireblast / Overheat
move 4: Protect
ability: Blaze
item: Charizardite Y
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========
Heat Wave is Charizard-Y's most reliable attack since it is a STAB spread move, has a nifty burn chance, and is boosted under the sun.
SolarBeam is a strong attack that hits the Water- and Rock-types that switch into Charizard-Y's Fire-type STABs really hard.
Overheat allows Charizard-Y to hit like a nuke under the sun, even granting 2HKO's on most Fire-type resists. However, it forces Charizard-Y to switch the next turn which can hurt its momentum greatly.
Fire Blast allows Charizard-Y to hid hard and play around Wide Guard users. It also doesn't make you switch like Overheat, it's just weaker.
Focus Blast also hits Rock-types in addition to Heatran, but its accuracy is annoying.
Protect allows Charizard-Y to scout for moves, stall opposing field conditions, and wreck gang-up strategies.
Set Details
========
A Modest nature allows Charizard-Y to hit like a fucker.
Timid is still a good option because Charizard-Y hits the important base 100 Speed tier, with threats such as Mega Kangaskhan equal in Speed.
Hidden Power Ground can be used for a reliable and efficient way to counter Heatran.
Ancientpower can be used to hit opposing Charizard.
Dragon Pulse can be used to hit Dragon-types for good damage reliably outside of a sun boosted Overheat.
Usage Tips
========
Should mega evolve on the first turn to power up its STAB Fire-type attacks.
Charizard-Y does a great job at keeping offensive pressure on the opponent with its strong Fire-type attacks in the sun and its great coverage.
Charizard-Y makes a great late-game sweeper with a strong Heat Wave and its good Speed.
Team Options
========
Chlorophyll Venusaur is a great partner because it outspeeds the almost all of the tier under the sun and can sleep or damage the opponents. It also covers Charizard-Y's Electric-type weakness and checks rain teams well.
Heatran enjoys using sun-boosted Heat Waves and Charizard-Y is immune to/resists Heatrans Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses, as well as weaking its Water-type weakness under the Sun.
Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop and Scrafty, can check the Rock-types such as Terrakion and Scarf Tyranitar that scare Charizard-Y.
Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Hitmontop can handle Charizard's Rock Slide, Surf, and Discharge weaknesses.
Speed Control really helps because most of Charizard-Y's counters simply outspeed it. Cresselia is a good option due to its bulk and Icy Wind. Togekiss also has good bulk and access to Tailwind.
Partners with Feint, such as Hitmontop and Mega Pinsir, allow Zard to spam Heat Wave even against Wide Guard users.
Charizard-Y enjoys partners with Helping Hand because it can do devastating damage with its spread move Heat Wave. Good partners with Helping Hand include Cresselia and Meowstic-M.

Mega Charizard-X
########
name: Mega Charizard-X
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Flare Blitz / Fire Punch
move 3: Dragon Claw
move 4: Protect / Substitute
ability: Blaze
item: Charizardite X
evs: 40 HP / 208 Atk / 32 Def / 228 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Dragon Dance allows Charizard-X to boost its Attack while outspeeding the entire tier.
Flare Blitz is Charizard-X's strongest STAB option, doing good damage to even most resists at +1.
Fire Punch has no recoil, but it hits way less hard.
Dragon Claw is a decently base powered reliable STAB attack that has good coverage with Flare Blitz.
Protect can be used to scout for attacks, stall field conditions, and wreck gang-up strategies. But, Charizard can take advantage of status users and Electric-type attacks aimed at the predicted Charizard-Y to set up Substitute, easing its sweep.
Set Details
========
Outspeeds Landorus-Therian and below at +0, and outspeeds Deoxys-A at +1.
Survives Landorus-Therian's Earthquake with the bulk.
252 Speed + Jolly is optional so Charizard-X can tie with threats such as Kangaskhan, Timid Charizard-Y, Jirachi, and Volcarona.
Burn-immune physical attackers are pretty rare in Doubles which is cool.
Earthquake is an option to beat Heatran.
Swords Dance could be used for greater immediate power at the risk of being revenge killed more likely.
Usage Tips
========
Generally just Dragon Dance until it is fast enough to outspeed the opponent's team. It has no trouble picking off threats with its attacks after a boost or two.
Charizard-X works best with its surprise factor, emerging as a physical sweeper when the opponent presents its answers to Charizard-Y, such as Electric-types like Rotom-W and Thundurus.
Keep Charizard out of play until it has the best chance to set up, because you don't want to spoil the mega evolution before the attempt to sweep.
Team Options
========
Follow Me/Rage Powder users make Charizard-X set up much easier. Togekiss is immune to Charizard-X's Ground-type weakness and Charizard handles the Electric-types aiming for it. Amoonguss can also sponge almost any attack aimed Charizard-X as well, or it can put to Sleep Charizard-X's threats making the sweep much easier.
Landorus-T can handle the Ground- and Rock-types that threaten Charizard-X in addition to Heatran, who walls the set.
Bisharp makes a good partner since it can pick off threats that outspeed Charizard-X with Sucker Punch and it punishes Pokemon with Intimidate switching in on Charizard-X.
Charizard-X appreciates speed control on its side. Popular Tailwind users are Togekiss, and Whimsicott. Pokemon with Thunder Wave, including Cresselia, Togekiss, and Thundurus, also make it much easier to set up and sweep.
Other Options
########
The necessity of a Mega Stone limits Charizard's other options.
Both Charizard-X and Charizard-Y could use Flame Charge to boost its Speed for a sweeping attempt, but it is typically too situational to work.
Charizard-Y could use Air Slash to stand a fighting chance against rain teams.
Charizard-X could attempt a sweep with Belly Drum, but it is risky and requires a lot of team support.
Both could use Will-O-Wisp to surprise their checks.
Charizard has access to Tailwind, which it could use to support the team.

Checks and Counters
########

**Attack Control**
While immune to Burns, Charizard-X can still be kept at bay by Intimidate users. Gyarados is the best example because it resists Flare Blitz, but Scrafty, Hitmontop, and Landorus-T can play around it as well as long as Charizard-X doesnt have Substitute up.
**Offensive Typing Advantage**
Charizard-Y struggles mainly with Dragon-types, as they can switch into most of its attacks and reply with strong STABs or super effective coverage.
Rock-types can also switch into Charizard-Y's Fire-type STABs and retaliate with their quadruple super effective STABs.
Most bulky Fire-types can switch into Charizard-Y's attacks. Heatran has Flash Fire and can 3HKO with Heat Wave under the sun. It cannot take too many Focus Blasts, though, and it is annihilated by Hidden Power Ground.

Most bulky Fire-type resists can switch into Charizard-X and not take much damage from Dragon Claw and its low Base Power.
Heatran completely walls the set if it lacks Earthquake.
**Opposing Weather**
Rain completely stops Charizard-Y. It weakens Charizard-Ys Fire-type attacks and prevents it from using Solar Beam. Politoed brings automatic rain and Ludicolo and Thundurus are popular setters.
Sand also stops Charizard, because Tyranitar has an easy switch in.
Rain also weakens Charizard-X's strongest STAB: Flare Blitz.
**Speed**
Popular Pokemon that can outspeed and hurt Charizard-X and Charizard-Y are Terrakion, Latios, Shaymin-Sky, Garchomp, and Thundurus.
Good Choice Scarf users that can outspeed and KO Charizard-X and Charizard-Y are Landorus-T and Tyranitar.
Choice Band Talonflame can do devastating damage and it lies on a faster priority bracket.
**Speed Control**
Thunder Wave severely hinders both Charizard-X and Charizard-Y's performance, becaue many more Pokemon can outspeed and KO them. Popular users are Cresselia and Thundurus.
The same thing applies for Tailwind, because many more threats can outspeed and KO both Charazards with it. Good setters include Togekiss, Talonflame, and Whimsicott.
Trick Room really hurts both Charizard megas since many threats can outslow and KO them, such as Rhyperior and Ampharos.
**Utility Moves**:
A fast encore can catch Charizard-Y in a Protect or Charizard-X in a Protect or Substitute. Good users are Whimsicott and Infernape.
Fake Out users can stop both megas and allow a teammate to freely attack them. Mega Kangaskhan's can do some decent damage, and other users include Scrafty, Hitmontop, and Meowstic-M.
While uncommon, Stealth Rock limits the amount of times either set can switch in drastically.
