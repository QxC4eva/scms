<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by a Pokemon, reduces the power of a damaging Ghost-type move that would hit the holder for super effective damage by 50%. Consumed after use. If the holder uses the move Natural Gift, this Berry will provide a one-time 60 Base Power Ghost-type attack.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The only Pokemon that can use this Berry are Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, as they are the only types that are hit super effectively by Ghost-type moves. However, most of these Pokemon would rather use another item. For example, Gengar and Mismagius might appreciate temporary resistance against Ghost-type moves, but they would rather prefer items that greatly increase their sweeping potential, such as Life Orb or Choice Specs.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
