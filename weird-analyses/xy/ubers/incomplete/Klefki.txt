-good typing, bad stats
-taunt bait, but will move before taunt thanks to prankster

    Thunder Wave = emergency stop to speedy mons like Xerneas, Blaziken, Mewtwo etc
    Toxic punishes defogers, grounds, ho-oh
    wip


Set Details
========

    max sdef+hp makes you a little durable, takes on yveltal and xerneas quite well
    also good evs for support arc, who you annoy like hell


Usage Tips
========

    attempt to get up lure in defogers and toxic them, and spike when given room
    toxic is very useful to throw out on many switches to mons like ho-oh, groudon etc
    switch on yveltal can be good, beware of taunt though
    generally, if your opponent has a speedy sweeper that you can stop, save klefki even if its low. prankster para comes in a handy a lot
    don't recklessly try to wall dragons, most can bust through you easily even if you are immune to their STAB


Team Options
========

    lando-t lando-t lando-t
    ground immunes generally good, yveltal likes spikes to pressure arceus formes
    water resists, kyogre/palkia can pressure grounds and ho-oh p well
    mons that appreciate spikes: ekiller, lucario, blaziken etc
    gengar can remove defoger, but gengar fits on every goddamn team anyway
    generally builds appreciate prankster t wave so they don't have to carry extremely solid blaze/geoxern counters

Checks & Counters
########

    grounds are immune to t wave
    ho-oh
    p much everything that can hit it hard and doesn't mind toxic or t wave TOO much
    heatran
    sdef kyogre
    it's not really hard to counter, but toxic/t wave screws with a lot of mons making it quite annoying anyway
