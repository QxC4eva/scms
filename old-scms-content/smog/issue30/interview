    <div class="aside">
        <p>I was awoken from my drunken slumbers late at night by the sound of another phone call. Seeing "Mysterious Voice" on the caller ID, I popped the battery out of my phone without answering and rolled back over. Just as I was drifting back to sleep, I heard another ringing. Looking around, I noticed my DS was apparently getting a phone call. I swore and flipped it open. "Hello?"</p>

        <p>The Mysterious Voice yelled out, "JELLICENT! Your very own POKEMON legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures with POKEMON awaits! Let's go!" My head began to swirl as I felt myself getting smaller and smaller. Then suddenly, I blacked out.</p>

        <p>I woke up drooling on a school desk. "The hell? Am I back at school?" I murmured, glancing about. I was in a classroom, though no other students appeared to be in the room. At the front, I could see a strange little pixelated man behind a professor's desk. Remembering the call from earlier, I realized at once what this must be and straightened up to give another interview.</p>

    <p>Alright Stellar, can you tell us a bit about yourself outside of Smogon? Where you're from, what you do, that sort of thing~</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>Sure thing! I'm a twenty-two-year-old guy from Brentwood, Tennessee. Currently, I'm a student at Vanderbilt University. I'll be graduating this year with degrees in English and Secondary Education. I've already completed student teaching and the other difficult parts of my degree, so I'm sort of just bumming around taking English classes that interest me until I graduate in December. When I'm not taking classes, I teach creative writing to middle school students as part of an after-school program. It's weird to think that some of Smogon's users are younger than the kids I interact with on a daily basis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker jelli">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_jelli.png" alt="Jellicent" />
    <p>That must feel strange. Do you have any hobbies besides the obvious Pok&eacute;mon and writing?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>Growing up in the '90s and 2000s, pop culture has served a pretty big role in my life. I love playing video games, reading books, and finding new artists and albums to listen to (although I am definitely not as musically sophisticated as most of the people who post in the Smogon music thread). I tend to stick to Nintendo franchises or games that are similar to Pokémon&mdash;I've never had the coordination necessary to hang with the pros on games like Halo or Call of Duty.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="aside">He twiddled his fingers a bit as if playing intensely on a controller before straightening back up and continuing.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>If you talk to any of my friends or family in real life they'll probably mention that I have a bit of a television addiction: I watch everything from Game of Thrones and Doctor Who to Gossip Girl and the Vampire Diaries. I think I'm just a sucker for a good story and engaging characters, whether it be in the form of a book or something I get to look forward to on a weekly basis. I also tend to read a lot of manga, so in a sense I'm just a really huge geek in all senses of the word. In high school I played a number of sports, most notably tennis and bowling. My school's bowling team actually made it to the finals of the state championship my senior year, which was a pretty cool experience. If I remember correctly, my high score is around 249.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker jelli">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_jelli.png" alt="Jellicent" />
    <p>Damn, 249! Not too shabby.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>I try, I try.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker jelli">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_jelli.png" alt="Jellicent" />
    <p>Shifting gears a bit, you joined Smogon over 5 years ago. What first got you interested in the site?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>To get to that answer, I'm going to have to back up a couple more years. My "Pokémon-on-the-Internet" phase kicked off the summer of 2006 as I waited anxiously for news of Diamond and Pearl (much like we've been doing the last few months with X and Y!). Being fourteen at the time, I experienced the need to discuss absolutely everything about everything, so I joined Serebii forums and quickly racked up thousands of posts. DP brought us the ability to battle on Wi-Fi, and I definitely milked that ability for all it was worth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="aside">As Stellar talked, I peered out the window for a moment. Squinting at a tree, I could've sworn I saw a Spearow roosting on a branch. I shook it off and looked back towards my friend.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>From the beginning of fourth gen, I always played "competitively" and loved coming up with new sets with all the new moves we had at our disposal. As my interest in competitive Pokémon grew, my sights shifted toward Smogon and the vast resources it offered. I created an account and immediately started posting sets (albeit for strange Pokémon like Flareon and Magcargo) and checking grammar. I got a badge before I hit one hundred posts and stuck with what I knew for a while. I eventually moved up to moderator of C&amp;C before shifting my focus to other sections of the site.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker jelli">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_jelli.png" alt="Jellicent" />
    <p>GPing is definitely a great way to get your feet wet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>Yeah, it was a bit different back in 2008 though, haha. Things weren't as streamlined as they are now, despite the best efforts of great users like Aldaron and Caelum.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker jelli">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_jelli.png" alt="Jellicent" />
    <p>Were there any particular sections of the community that caught your eye after moving past C&amp;C?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>For about a year, I was pretty intensely focused on CAP. As with C&amp;C, I started participating in the project when it was experiencing a period of inactivity, and I did my best to get things jump-started again. Strangely enough, I don't even remember being a major part of any one CAP's creation, I sort of just helped with organization. I was one of the people who worked to get the first version of CAP's hub up and running. As with C&amp;C, I eventually moved up to a moderator position in the forum for a short while. My memories of my time in CAP are a bit fuzzy, but I remember having great times on the server with Elevator Music, Flounder, Plus, Beej, and tons of other people whom I've sadly fallen out of contact with over the years.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="aside">Seemingly unbeknownst to Stellar, a small Mime Jr. had crawled up on the table behind him. I did my best not to giggle as it cutely mimicked his hand motions.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>I ended up "quitting" Smogon for a period of about half a year after that in order to focus on school (like this ever actually works… Smogon is like the Hotel California: you can check out but you can never leave). When I returned, I started becoming more involved with Smogon's simulator server. I had pretty much always been a moderator on Shoddy and helped out a bit with our attempted move to Pokémon Lab, but Pokémon Online is where I really hit my stride. As with CAP, I ended up serving a largely organizational role, helping to revamp an outdated moderator list (causing a bit of a backlash, whoops!) while dealing with ban appeals and that sort of thing. Eventually, I moved up to server administrator and served in that capacity for a while before having to take another break due to school.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="aside">Without turning around, Stellar pulled out a Poké Ball and coolly called back the Mime Jr. I couldn't help but frown a bit.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker jelli">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_jelli.png" alt="Jellicent" />
    <p>In more recent times, you've become known for your work in Orange Islands. Was there anything in particular that motivated you to get involved there?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>I like to think of Orange Islands as a well-earned vacation after the many years of work I put into the site. Despite years of dedication to the competitive sphere (participating in suspect tests, SPL, cheerleading during World Cup, etc.), I've never lost the sense of wonder I get from just playing the actual game. I was a bit of a laughingstock when BW was released because I must have played it at least fifteen times in a row. While I'm not a champ at Pokémon Snap like most of Orange Island's regulars, I do love me some Puzzle Challenge and Rumble Blast. Games aside, I just really love the people who frequent the forum and its general vibe. Things are more relaxed, and the people are a bit less gung-ho. Some of my fondest memories on Smogon have come from the last couple years. Racing Mekkah through Pokémon Sapphire and his failing miserably to defeat Maxie is probably something I'll never forget.</p>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>Recently, I attended VGC Nationals in Indianapolis and Worlds in Vancouver and had the opportunity to meet a lot of the people I've been interacting with on IRC in real life. As much as I dislike using the world surreal, it really is the perfect word to describe the experience. I know people have said this before, but it was astounding how easily I was able to translate my online friendships into offline friendships. The sense of camaraderie among Pokémon players is amazing and it was a joy just to be at the events. I met zerowing (makiri), Huy, and Cassie in Indianapolis and latched onto them. I also got to meet Mekkah and Layell in person in Vancouver, which was really cool.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker jelli">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_jelli.png" alt="Jellicent" />
    <p>Do you have any recommendations for more casual players that want to get into the competitive scene?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>I think Professor Oak had it right when he sent Ash off on his adventure to fill up the Pokédex: the more you know about Pokémon's movepools, stats, typings, and abilities, the more prepared you will be to make appropriate decisions in the thick of battle. Competitive Pokémon just comes down to who has more knowledge and who can apply that knowledge to team building and decision making. It might just be the teacher in me speaking, but study up!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker jelli">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_jelli.png" alt="Jellicent" />
    <p>Definitely some good advice there. So, you've recently been named head of OI; do you have any plans for the future about how to lead it?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>I definitely want to work to craft a more cohesive community. Tying together IRC and the forums is one of my main goals, and one that I've been working for a few months to bring to fruition. I've attempted to integrate a lot of the newer users that the XY thread is attracting into our community by drawing them to IRC. So far this has worked pretty well: we have a few new IRC regulars like Yveltal and Shockwave527 who are always ready and willing to discuss new info. I attempted to make Google+ hangouts happen, and they did for a while (check out Deinosaur's article in last month's Smog for more details), but the interface just wasn't conducive to multiple people chatting and playing at the same time. Recently, Jimera0 and TheMantyke have been streaming their gameplay every Friday and these streams have attracted a good number of users, so I'm incredibly proud of the effort they continue to put in every week. My most recent attempt at strumming up a sense of community is the XY Giveaway Contest. It was actually a bit inspired by your Orange League from a while back! I'm anteing up the cash to provide two winners with a copy of XY each. I think the prize really incentivizes everyone to try their hardest, so the competition so far has been pretty brutal. Each round is a throwback to a previous generation, starting with RBY and ending with BW in the finals. It's been good fun so far, so if everything goes as planned, I'd love to host more prize competitions in the future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker jelli">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_jelli.png" alt="Jellicent" />
    <p>Haha, awesome! Now, for the only question that people bothered reading this thing for anyway: what's your favorite Pokemon?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="aside">Stellar's demeanor changed from lighthearted to frustrated in a flash.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>FU! This is the most difficult question I get asked because I have 100. Ugh, I was dreading this question the entire time. My favorite Pokémon shifts on a daily basis, but let's see.. If I had to pick one it would probably be Togekiss. I very vividly remember dreaming about Togetic before the release of Gold and Silver (and no, this was not one of those crazy Theorymon dreams). It sound a bit hokey, but I've always felt like I shared a connection with Togetic's evolutionary line. DP took something I already loved and made it better competitively, something that was really important to me back then.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker jelli">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_jelli.png" alt="Jellicent" />
    <p>Aww, that's pretty cool. So, do you have any closing comments you'd like to leave us with?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>I'd like to thank everyone who has been a part of my Smogon journey so far. I've mentioned a few names above, but I would never be able to do everyone justice. Also, if any of you are looking forward to XY as much as I am, hold on to your seat belts because it's going to be a bumpy ride. The beginning of a new generation is the best time to become more involved with the Smogon community, so if you see an area of the site that interests you, jump in head first and don't look back.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker jelli">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_jelli.png" alt="Jellicent" />
    <p>So true, my man. Anyway, it was a pleasure interviewing you ^.^</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-speaker stellar">
    <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue30/interview_stellar.png" alt="Stellar" />
    <p>The pleasure was all mine~ ^.^</p>
    </div>

    <div class="aside">
        <p>As I walked outside, I realized I had no idea where I was. Spotting a snoozing Stoutland in the shade, I remembered just how groggy I felt and rested my head on the fluffy beast.</p>

        <p>When I awoke the next morning, I was back in my own bed. I was about to shake it all off as a dream, but decided to boot up my DS. I noticed Stellar's Friend Code had been added to my Pal Pad, and a new Stoutland was in my party. Be it a dream or reality, this vivid experience was certainly... stellar~</p>
