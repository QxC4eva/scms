
Overview
########

    Great Special Attack and strong special bulk, which is even better in Mega forme
    Decent Psychic / Fairy typing which allows it to take on plenty of threats
    Excellent movepool both offensively and in support, so it is very versatile
    Can cover many threats in its coverage moves
    Immune to Dragon helps
    Extremely vulnerable on the physical side, so it will fold to literally any physical attack


Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Hyper Voice
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Hidden Power Ground / Focus Blast
move 4: Taunt / Shadow Ball
item: Gardevoirite
ability: Trace (Pixilate)
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Hyper Voice provides a strong, reliable Fairy STAB move that smashes Dragons; with Pixilate the move hits very hard
    Psyshock hits past Blissey, Venusaur, and Scolipede while also getting good neutral coverage against Talonflame
    Hidden Power Ground hits Steel- and Fire-types who resist Hyper Voice
    Focus Blast provides a powerful coverage move to maul Ferrothorn and to a smaller extent hitting Scizor hard
    Taunt is useful to stop status moves and also makes Gardevoir a good stallbreaker
    Shadow Ball is primarily for the omnipresent Aegislash, who resists Gardevoir's other moves
    Calm Mind though is usable if you want more special bulk and power


Set Details
========

    Trace is a good ability for non Mega Gardevoir, as it can trace things like Klefki's Prankster and the like to pull off more tricks
    Gardevoirite is useful to activate Mega Garde
    You could run Modest, but Gardevoir prefers to have all the speed it needs
    Hidden Power Fire could be used if you're really scared of Forretress, Scizor, and Genesect, but beyond that is very situational
    Destiny Bond could be usable to do a double down against Aegislash or if it's in general about to go down


Usage Tips
========

    This set is a boosting sweeper, mainly aiming to hit hard with Pixilate Hyper Voice and great coverage moves, while CM gives it more power when it gets such chance to boost
    This should get in when it gets the chance, Trace is a useful ability to switch in as is its typing, and you can then activate Mega Gardevoir to start spamming Hyper Voice


Team Options
========

    Bisharp and Mandibuzz are good teammates to handle Aegislash, the former also appreciates the removal of Fighting-types
    Talonflame can handle most Steels barring maybe Aegislash
    Fighting-types are also very good bets


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Moonblast
move 2: Shadow Ball / Psyshock
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Destiny Bond / Healing Wish / Trick
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Trace
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Moonblast is Gardevoir's most reliable Fairy STAB, which provides good coverage
    Shadow Ball hits Aegislash while Psyshock hits Blissey and Scolipede
    Focus Blast is there for Ferrothorn and Heatran
    Destiny Bond can bring a double down against something like Aegislash or Gengar
    Healing Wish though can be used for quick suicide if Gardevoir is no longer useful, healing a weakened teammate is always very helpful
    Trick though is nice to pester walls like Blissey and Skarmory

Set Details
========

    Timid maximizes Speed to utilize Scarf with
    Trace is just an amazing ability, copying certain abilities to provide good switch-in opportunities
    Memento is a good option over Healing Wish or Destiny Bond to provide something like SD Talonflame a nice setup opportunity

Usage Tips
========

    This set is a great revenge killer, being able to take on a number of fast offensive threats such as Greninja, Garchomp, and the Latis
    With Gardevoir's rare support options like Healing Wish, it can sacrifice itself to do a number of useful things

Team Options
========

    Bisharp and Absol both make viable teammates, and both sport good offensive synergy with Gardevoir
    Garchomp can handle Aegislash rather decently
    Fighting-types like Terrakion and Keldeo can handle Steel-types besides Aegislash rather well


Other Options
========

    Healing Wish / Memento on non Scarf sets
    Hypnosis
    Psychic, but Moonblast is a better STAB
    Sunny Day / Rain Dance
    Specs

Checks and Counters
========

    Scizor / Genesect
    Talonflame
    Aegislash
    Scolipede
    Special walls; namely the blobs
    Any physical attacker that is faster; it's really frail on the physical side and its Speed isn't exactly amazing
