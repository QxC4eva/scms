<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Predictably started the crew off with Jolly LO Darmanitan. I'm not exaggerating when I say it kills everything. I wanted Stealth Rocks and a way to deal with problem pirates so I went with a Tank Rhyperior. Its the pillar that supports this crew, and it stops it from being overrun by a bunch of annoying threats. The team was pretty weak to Water-types, so LO Roserade was chosen to deal with them. Roserade is the special equivalent of Darmanitan(somewhat), it fasts and it hits hard. I picked Blastoise as the token spinner and bulky Water-type. Without him, the team (Darmanitan especially) wouldn't last a turn against those spike stacking teams. I noticed that this crew could use a speed boost, so I decided to run Choice Scarf Krookodile. Krookodile can check some of the strongest threats in UU, and it makes short work of most Ghost / Psychic types. Mew was added to the crew as secondary special sweeper and because we needed proper Fighting sweeper.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Darmanitan</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Sheer Force<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Superpower<br />
- U-turn</p>

<p>The undisputed king of physical attackers in UU! LO Darmanitan is a monster in OU, few teams can outright counter it, and its coverage moves weaken most of its counters anyway. Sheer Force LO boosted Flare Blitz is one of the strongest attacks in the game, and it flat out annihilates anything that doesn't resist. I can't think of a Pokemon who takes neutral damage from Flare Blitz that can avoid the 2HKO from this monster. Even a physically defensive Dusclops with maximum defense EVs gets 2HKOed with Stealth Rock, so hold DAT. Earthquake provides Darmanitan with obvious coverage, and it ruins Chandelure/Arcanine. Darmanitan has no problem bluffing a choice set, so I users switch into Darmanitan's FlareBlitz fairly often and get killed by EQ afterwards. Superpower seems a bit redundant alongside EQ, but Darmanitan has nothing else, and the extra damage against Rhyperior / bulky waters is nice. U-turn is a cowards move, but scouting switches has always been fun. Darmanitan is this crew's primary physical attacker, and is surprisingly agile given its base speed stat. I typically use it as a lead against Roserade and Deoxys-D or midgame usually via revenge killing. I used to run an Adamant nature for even more power, but missing out on outspeed Roserade, Jolly Heracross and possible modest base 100's was stupid. It never lasts for the entire match, but it takes down like 2-3 pirates. </p>

<p><strong>Rhyperior</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Solid Rock<br />
EVs: 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 SpD<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Megahorn</p>

<p>Rhyperior is such a good tank, its no wonder that I end up using it on most of my teams. It only got better this gen, with top tier physical attackers like Darmanitan, Stoutland and Honckrow showing up so having it on my team is usually priority Uno. Rhyperior is the crew's only hazard user, so ensuring his survival early game is a priority. I usually play him safe, but there are times where his death is nearly unavoidable (dealing with HP grass Raikou / HP Grass Honckrow) and if I don't set up SR (especially when dealing with stupid strong SR weak mons) this team struggles. Anyway, Earthquake obliterates things and Stone Edge slices things to pieces (I use Stone Edge because I can't afford to miss the OHKO on Zapdos and other rock weak pirates who can avoid the OHKO from Rhyperior) Megahorn is used to target Slowbro for an easy breezy 2HKO, and Flygon. The spread seems odd, but I use it to avoid the 2HKO from HP Ice Raikou after SR. I dropped those speed evs after Donphan got sent up to OU. Rhyperior is the first to deal with several of the "problem" pirates that plague the tier. Its my first defense against the likes of Zapdos, Raikou and Darmanitan, something I admit is a bad thing, but it does a decent job due to its incredible bulk.</p>

<p><strong>Roserade</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe <br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Leaf Storm<br />
- Sludge Bomb<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Rest</p>

<p>LO Roserade is just brutal. I know everyone is bent out of shape over that spike stacking set, but damn this set just blows holes into teams. Not many teams can take on Roserade, especially now that Chansey is gone and Registeel is almost nonexistant. Its the special equivalent of Darmanitan, with some extra tricks to keep opposing pirates on their toes. Leaf Storm hits hard, so hard in fact, it will OHKO most Suicune even after a Calm mind boost. Sludge Bomb is an underrated move because it obliterates every non-steel Roserade check. Heracross takes over 65%, Moltres gets wrecked, Darmanitan keels over and dies, Zapdos hates taking them (etc you get the idea) and oftentimes i'll throw them out to catch any Sleep fodder Pokemon too. Speaking of Sleep, if Sleep Powder manages to put a Pokemon to sleep, this team gets a huge advantage. Giving free turns to the likes of Darmanitan is not something you want to deal with. Rest is used because I absolutely need Roserade to stick around, because it checks practically every singly bulky-water type in the tier, and they ruin this team otherwise. Without Roserade, I'd outright lose to teams with strong long lasting bulky water types like Roserade because then i'd have no way to directly hurt them. </p>

<p><strong>Blastoise</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Torrent<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Scald<br />
- Roar<br />
- Ice Beam</p>

<p>Man Blastoise is so underrated. Its known as that "2 for 1 deal" but Blastoise is so much more than that. Ok maybe its not, but the point still stands, it pulls double duty well. IMO, Blastoise is the strongest spinner after Donphan left because it gives most of the common spin blockers trouble. (Froslass, Chandelure, etc) Every time Blastoise burns a spinblocker with Iconic, a devil gains its horns. Anyway, as a Rapid spinner Blastoise is second to none due its balanced defensive stats and typing. Iconic is a solid attacking move as always, there have been many battles where I was saved by a triple burn. Roar is an undervalued move on Blastoise (I don't like playing games with ghost types using foresight) and forcing out problem pirates mid - lategame is always stellar. Ice Beam is a staple, and it wrecks Flygon so I can't go without it. </p>

<p><strong>Krookodile</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Moxie<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Pursuit</p>

<p>Krookodile is cool, very cool. Its my favorite choice scarf user in UU and was flat out a necessity on most of my teams back when Alakazam was UU, but its still useful even with the big man gone. Earthquake strikes fast and fierce, but I wish I ran EQ for more power. It nets me so many more random OHKOes (guaranteed OHKOed on things like Roserade, bulky Arcanine, etc) and it works hand in hand with moxie. Crunch and Pursuit takes out Dark weak (specifically ghost types so Blastoise can Rapid Spin) and Stone Edge targets flying types like Zapdos. Its the worst move in the game, so games hinging on a Stone Edge hit are almost always lost. Krookodile provides this team with extra speed, and is a top notch revenge killer. Its list of revenge kill-able targets is quite wide, and it serves them up for brunch like a rich dude gets served on a butler island. Even the problem pirates like Raikou and Zapdos are covered. Jolly is used because there are times where I lost because I couldn't outspeed Jolly Heracross and Adamant Darmanitan. After it gets a kill, it has no problem sweeping through entire teams because of moxie, and is one of (if not the best) choice scarf cleaner in the game. </p>

<p><strong>Mew</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Synchronize<br />
EVs: 74 HP / 252 SpA / 180 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Aura Sphere<br />
- Shadow Ball</p>

<p>Mew is my secondary special attacker and top tier fighting resist. I had several other pirates in place of Mew, but none of them "fit" as much as Mew did. I tried the support set, but it wasn't strong enough and it let Darmanitan / Chandelure come in to easily. Anyway, Nasty Plot kicks some serious ass, its so underrated in OU. After a Nasty Plot boost, Mew can OHKO pretty much anything in UU, and its so damn bulky so its also impossible to OHKO it in one shot. Nasty Plot boosted Psychic wrecks shop, and now that Chansey is gone there is no reason to use that piece of crap Psyshock (seriously, its noticeably weaker than Psychic) Aura Sphere gives me coverage (yada yada yada) and takes annoying Bisharp who overstep their bounderies (gotta play the Sucker Punch game though...) and Shadow Ball kills opposing psychic type & ghost types. The EV spread lets me outspeed timid Roserade and Moltres (I was thinking of running enough speed to outspeed Darmanitan, but most of them are choiced/he's covered by 3 pokemon) Mew is one of the few Pokemon on this team that can actually take "hits" so if it goes down I know i'm in a world of trouble, especially against slower bulkier teams. On top of this, its the second fastest member on this team, so It really needs to stick around against faster frailer teams. </p>
