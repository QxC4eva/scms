[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Causes one target to have its positive evasion stat stage set to 0 while it is active. Normal- and Fighting-type attacks can hit the target if it is a Ghost-type. The effect ends when the target is no longer active. Fails if the target is already affected. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Foresight serves a possibly gamebreaking role of ensuring that a spinner is able to use Rapid Spin against a Ghost-type, getting entry hazards off of the user's side of a field so that a teammate can enter the battlefield safely. However, the strategy is more commonly seen in the lower tiers, particularly in UU and RU. In UU, Blastoise and Hitmontop are common users of the strategy, while in RU Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee are often seen using the strategy.</p>

<p>The combination of Rapid Spin and Foresight is such a force in the lower tiers that teams will often employ a "double Ghost" strategy, where the team will use two Ghost-types on the team to ensure that entry hazards will stay on the opponent's side of the field since the effect of Foresight disappears once the target is switched out. This allows double Ghost teams to constantly switch between the two Ghosts to never allow the opponent to get a Rapid Spin off.</p>
