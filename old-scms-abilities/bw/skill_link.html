<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Multi-hit moves used by the wielder will always hit the maximum number of times. The number of hits is determined before the move is executed, so even if the wielder loses Skill Link mid-attack (via <a href="/bw/abilities/mummy">Mummy</a>), it will still hit the maximum number of times. When <a href="/bw/moves/triple_kick">Triple Kick</a> is used by the wielder, it has only one accuracy check instead of three; if it hits the first kick, it will hit all three.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Skill Link is most commonly seen on <a href="/bw/pokemon/cloyster">Cloyster</a>, who is definitely a Pokemon to prepare for. After a <a href="/bw/moves/shell_smash">Shell Smash</a>, an effective 125 Base Power <a href="/bw/moves/icicle_spear">Icicle Spear</a> due to Skill Link is going to hurt everything that doesn't resist it. Cloyster also has <a href="/bw/moves/rock_blast">Rock Blast</a> to watch out for as well. It allows multi-hit moves to become viable and moves such as Icicle Spear to become extremely powerful without any drawbacks, besides possibly accuracy. The only other notable user is <a href="/bw/pokemon/cinccino">Cinccino</a>, who possesses monstrous power in RU thanks to its combination of high Speed, decent Attack, and Tail Slap, Rock Blast, and <a href="/bw/moves/bullet_seed">Bullet Seed</a>, all of which are maximized by Skill Link.</p>
