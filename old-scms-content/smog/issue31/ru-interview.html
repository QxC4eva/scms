<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>With BW RU is coming to a close, I've decided to interview four veterans of RU&mdash;Molk, Nails, Oglemi, and SilentVerse&mdash;and get their opinions on RU's first generation. When I put out the call, I received a message to travel to the deserts of Egypt. After a few flights, I had finally arrived and followed a guide by the name of "Aroo", who led me to a mighty temple with statues of Slowking, Druddigon, and other powerful Pok&eacute;mon from RU. In the temple, there were four paths. I decided to choose the one that was titled "Nails's Throne Room". As I walked in, I noticed the walls were decorated with various paintings of red pandas. In the center of the room was Nails himself, sitting on a throne. After a quick moment of surprise, I decided to start the interview.</p>

<div class="interview">

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Hello.</p></div>

<div class="speaker nails"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_nails.png" alt ="nails" /><p>What's up?</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>After some chit-chat, I decided it was time to start the interview itself.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>So what attracted you to RU?</p></div>

<div class="speaker nails"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_nails.png" alt="nails" /><p>As soon as the tier was announced, I registered all of the channels I could think of relating to RU. I think I got #rarelyused, #genvru, and there was probably one more that I can't remember. I don't remember why I did it. Oglemi showed up and said he wanted to lead the tier and asked if I wanted to lead it with him: I said yes. He did some behind-the-scenes stuff and a few months later posted a thread saying he wanted me as his second-in-command.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>And how long did it take you to become the skilled battler you are today?</p></div>

<div class="speaker nails"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_nails.png" alt="" /><p>That's a loaded question. Let's see... I joined Smogon in May 2010 and played mostly Little Cup for a year and a half, then diversified into other metagames when BW came out; partly because I hated what Eviolite had done to my beloved LC and partly because everybody was learning instead of just me, which made jumping into late DPP OU both difficult and unwelcoming. My main strength as a player is creativity, and in a brand new metagame with new mechanics, I could shine. I'm not really sure how to answer the question, as I've gotten a lot better from where I started. But, I still often doubt my skill as a battler and relative to other top players, I don't consider myself to be that skilled (august always kicks my ass in everything). I guess I've developed as a player the whole time, and I can't really pinpoint a time when I made a huge jump, just over time I've gradually improved. Interesting question, tricky to answer.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Cool. In all your time in RU, is there specific Pok&eacute;mon or playstyle that you feel that never got a chance to shine?</p></div>

<div class="speaker nails"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_nails.png" alt="nails" /><p>I love coming up with new sets and generally trying to innovate, and a lot of individual Pok&eacute;mon that were underused have risen a little in popularity; everyone on #rarelyused is pretty open about the stuff they use and like sharing new ideas, so nothing's really that surprising. It's a really great environment. I'm gonna give a shout-out to Protox (Protect and Toxic) Entei and Poliwrath as both of them are really solid when used correctly, but it's pretty weird for most people so I don't worry too much about those. As for playstyles, I have pretty much exclusively played balance, and that was the dominant style for my entire run as RU tiering leader. The metagame shifted a bit more towards offense after, and august crushes everyone with his stall team. I guess stall has been a bit neglected, but that's really just because there are no special walls so it's not like it hasn't been tried. I'm happy with how RU went during BW overall.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Good answer! Has there ever been a suspect test banning that you haven't really agreed with?</p></div>

<div class="speaker nails"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_nails.png" alt="nails" /><p>Never. Everything that was banned had it coming; the only thing I disagreed with was Cresselia's unbanning. I thought about Sharpedo back in the first half of BW, and was bitter about Durant's unbanning, but testing just showed that they were strong, but not broken.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>It's nice to hear that the suspect tests have almost always been solid. What about things you felt were overrated?</p></div>

<div class="speaker nails"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_nails.png" alt="nails" /><p>I've always thought Galvantula, Manectric, and Omastar were bad Pok&eacute;mon in RU because of their frailty and as a result, how easy they were to revenge kill. I thought Feraligatr was pretty overrated when people started using it because I didn't think it was fast or strong enough to bother setting up, but I've had a change of heart. I'm not a huge fan of Emboar which is currently getting a lot of love, but that's because I don't like any Pok&eacute;mon that can't effectively deal with Slowking (this is why I use Protox Entei and Poliwrath). I always thought Absol was trash because it's so frail. Scyther, Typhlosion, Ferroseed, Whimsicott (how is this thing still in RU lol), and Hariyama were all popular in BW1 and I thought they were terrible Pok&eacute;mon relative to other choices available. Also ShakeItUp is very overrated.</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>I was about to say, "I know right? My little sister watches that show all the time. It's so annoying!" before I realized he was talking about the user.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>I gotta agree with you on Whimsicott. You've been quite vocal on how you wish Eviolite never touched Little Cup. If Eviolite had been banned from LC, would you have played more BW RU or would LC have be your tier of choice?</p></div>

<div class="speaker nails"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_nails.png" alt="nails" /><p>I have no clue how things would've gone in retrospect. There were other, lesser reasons I stopped playing Little Cup (among them was it was not in the SPL and I wanted to practice for major tournaments) and I'm not sure that I would've liked a format without Eviolite either.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Either way, RU seems to suit you really well. So, big question here: What was your favorite Pok&eacute;mon to use in RU?</p></div>

<div class="speaker nails"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_nails.png" alt="nails" /><p>Slowking. There is no second place; Slowking is my first love and it has never changed. It's the best wall and can be the best attacker in the tier depending on the set you want to run. Calm Mind sweeps are incredibly difficult to stop. Nasty Plot Slowking can chunk down an unsuspecting team alarmingly quickly before switching out to safety. Choice Specs is impossible to switch into safely, except, somewhat ironically, by opposing Slowking (Cradily and Regice are both pretty much irrelevant in RU though they can too I guess). Trick Room Slowking is mostly a gimmick as far as I'm concerned because it can be used more effectively in non-sweeping roles but even that's still solid. Yeah, I love me some Slowking.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Thanks for your time. Final question: RU ready to say goodbye?</p></div>

<div class="speaker nails"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_nails.png" alt="nails" /><p>Yeah, I can't wait for XY.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Okay, thanks. I'll see you around.</p></div>

<div class="speaker nails"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_nails.png" alt="nails" /><p>Sweet dreams.</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>After leaving Nail's throne room, I walked into the next room; aptly called "SilentVerse's Room of Bugs". In this room, the walls were decorated with various adorable Bug-types such as Butterfree and Surskit. The room was quite calm. In it, SilentVerse was relaxing in a comfortable looking sun chair, with a Butterfree resting on his shoulder. I walked up to him, said a few greetings, and began the interview.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>So what attracted you to RU?</p></div>

<div class="speaker silentverse"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_silentverse.png" alt="silentverse" /><p>Honestly, when the tier was first announced, I actually wasn't that interested in it. At that time, I was playing BW UU pretty extensively, and I didn't really see any need to pick up a new, lower tier. However, after a while, I wasn't really liking the direction UU was taking as it seemed like it was starting to become more like DPP OU (which I was absolutely terrible at) rather than DPP UU like I had hoped, and I just didn't seem to have much fun playing BW UU in comparison to DPP UU. So, around Round 2 of RU or so, I built a five minute team that used Butterfree and a similar structure to the teams I had built in DPP UU, and messed around on the ladder for a bit. I actually ended up enjoying myself quite a bit, ultimately getting ranked at around #2 on the ladder or so. Eventually, I found #rarelyused, and with some encouragement from Nails, I ended up chatting a bunch in the channel, and from that moment, I was hooked!</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Cool, I now see the inspiration for your DPP UU vs BW RU article. Out of the two, which do you prefer?</p></div>

<div class="speaker silentverse"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_silentverse.png" alt="silentverse" /><p>For nostalgia reasons, I'd have to say DPP UU. It was probably the first metagame that I actually became half-decent at, and it had a very large role in shaping me into the player I am today. In my opinion, DPP UU itself was just such an amazing metagame; nothing ever seemed overly powerful or unmanageable for most of the tier's life, and there was just so much freedom in teambuilding that you really felt like you could use anything and win. BW RU does capture a lot of those things in a similar manner, but I do feel there's a lot of stuff that's far too restricting for my tastes, teambuilding-wise (coughdurantcough). Even though it's similar, I still feel that as a metagame, DPP UU is better.</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>At that moment, I felt a bit of regret about never getting into DPP UU.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Interesting. Looking at some of your RMTs I noticed your latest was a stall team. Do you feel that stall was underused?</p></div>

<div class="speaker silentverse"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_silentverse.png" alt="silentverse" /><p>I think stall was a highly unexplored playstyle before DittoCrow and I had popularized it with our RMT Foundations. I mean, while there were certainly a couple of people who had experimented with stall before Foundations (such a user named Avira), stall wasn't really big at all beforehand, with most people favoring bulky offense or balance; after all, those were by far the most accessible playstyles, not to mention the fact that a lot of people seem to think that stall is a stupid, boring playstyle (which I heavily disagree with but whatever). I also think that a part of the reason stall hadn't been explored until then was also the fact that incredibly powerful threats such as Lilligant, Porygon-Z, etc. all seemed incredibly hard for stall to deal with; so many people just gave up on the playstyle as a whole, especially given all the power creep BW brought. It wasn't really until Foundations destroyed a lot of prolific RU players at the time that stall finally became a major player in the tier, and forced people to adapt to its presence.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Hopefully stall will be more popular in XY RU.</p></div>

<div class="speaker silentverse"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_silentverse.png" alt="silentverse" /><p>Perhaps. Hopefully it only becomes popular when the tier gets an established playerbase though, or it might turn people away from the tier!</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>I hope so as well. What were your favorite NU Pok&eacute;mon to use in RU?</p></div>

<div class="speaker silentverse"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_silentverse.png" alt="silentverse" /><p>Well, I've always had this thing for making a lot of those really bad, early-game Bug-types work in RU, but of those, Butterfree and Mothim were probably my favourite. Butterfree was a ridiculously fun Pok&eacute;mon to use because despite its reputation for being a terrible Pok&eacute;mon, a lot of teams actually didn't have a solid answer for the Quiver Dance set, and it set up on a lot of the common Pok&eacute;mon in the tier at the time (Gligar, Claydol, and Uxie), so it was actually a surprisingly effective sweeper that was absolutely hilarious to sweep with. Similarly, Mothim was cool because it was a hilariously anti-meta Pok&eacute;mon that wrecked all those silly Tank + OTR Cofagrigus cores that were used all the time back in the day. I honestly can't think of anything more satisfying than smashing people with 400 BST Bugs!</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Yep, I can tell you're a fan of Bug-types. What would you say were the best Bug-types that you could use in RU? Also, would you say Butterfree and/or Masquerain were your favorite Pok&eacute;mon to use in RU?</p></div>

<div class="speaker silentverse"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_silentverse.png" alt="silentverse" /><p>Outside of shitty bugs, Escavalier is definitely the best Bug-type in RU currently. It has a fantastic typing, it's stupidly strong, and it just checks so many important threats that I honestly find myself slapping it on the teams I don't use Steelix on. Durant is a close second though, mainly because it's incredibly fast and is super strong too.</p>

<p>Yeah, Butterfree is my favorite. Sweeping with a Pok&eacute;mon that seems as bad as Butterfree is honestly just one of the best feelings you can get from playing competitive Pok&eacute;mon.</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>The feeling of youth and nostalgia filled me when I thought about when I tried to sweep with bad Pok&eacute;mon in the past.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Yeah, it really is a lot of fun sweeping with bad Pok&eacute;mon. I used to do the same with Moxie Krokorok. Now, time for the final question: RU ready to say goodbye?</p></div>

<div class="speaker silentverse"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_silentverse.png" alt="silentverse" /><p>RU has been such a blast for me and there's a lot of things I'm going to miss as we move into XY. #rarelyused, the drama, the tier itself... I've really enjoyed these things through my time in the tier, and they will be sorely missed going into XY. Still, even though BW RU has been a blast, I'm excited for XY, so I suppose that yes, I'm ready to say goodbye!</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Very heartfelt answer there. Thanks for your time!</p></div>

<div class="speaker silentverse"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_silentverse.png" alt="silentverse" /><p>No problem.</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>After leaving SilentVerse's room and wiping a few tears from my eyes (I'm allergic to Butterfree pollen), I stumbled upon a room titled "Molk's Dojo". Inside were paintings of Dragons across the wall, all looking as awesome as possible. There were also a memorial in the corner dedicated to Cofagrigus's greatest sets in RU. In the center of the room was Molk, meditating on a mat. He opened his eyes and motioned to me to come towards him. I sat down in front of him and we began the interview.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Hello.</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>Hey.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>So what about RU convinced you to join?</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>Let's see... I was playing OU quite a bit during the early part of BW1 and it started to get a bit boring to me. I was considering trying out UU but I heard that there was a fresh new tier called RU being made. I thought it'd be a fun new thing to try so I played a few matches, liked the tier, and I've been playing it ever since.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Same thing kinda happened to me. Did it take you a little while to warm up to RU or did you fall in love with it immediately?</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>I actually fell in love with it immediately: I really liked a lot of Pok&eacute;mon in the metagame. The community was also really nice, even though I had a really rough start with them at first. Anyone around back then will remember. When I first joined the RU community, I was pretty young and immature (I actually only missed being COPPA-banned by a few months). I was also pretty impulsive and tended to act before I thought about the consequences. Because there was a lot of strain between me and the rest of the RU community, and I ended up getting kicked or banned from IRC channels and the battle server quite a bit because of my behaviour and stuff. It took me a pretty long time to get rewarded for my work in C&amp;C, taking like double or triple the amount of work it took other people to get a ladybug even after I was badged. I was still pretty immature and I did a lot of dumb stuff (most notably RU Metang 2012, I seriously have no clue why I did that lol). Eventually, I started getting used to the community a bit more and became less immature and impulsive, and everything turned out fine in the end.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>It's quite nice to hear you've managed to reach where you are now after hearing how you started out.</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>It was quite surprising to be chosen as a tier leader, given my track record, heh.</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>At this point, I noticed there was a rather large flower next to me. It felt so out of place that I kept on wondering what it was doing there.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Despite how mature you've gotten, you still use joke teams quite a bit. Do you feel that joke teams have helped formed what we all know now as BW RU?</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>Most of the time I just use joke teams and Pok&eacute;mon for the fun of it, often just to see if I can win with them, although there are some joke sets / Pok&eacute;mon I've actually used on serious teams because they managed to perform well through my time playing RU. I'm not sure if they helped form the metagame themselves, but using joke teams kinda helped bring the community together, if you know what I mean. It's always fun to make a team with the most absurd Pok&eacute;mon and sets possible, then try and make it work.</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>Trying to sniff the flower, I close in a little, only to be sprayed in the face with water. Oh, that trickster. After wringing out my tie, I asked the next question.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Yeah, I totally understand what you mean. What was your favourite period in RU?</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>I'd have to say I liked three periods of RU in particular: the metagame just before Honchkrow and company moved up to UU, the very end of BW1 RU, and right now.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>What was it about those periods that made you like them so much?</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>The Late-Krow meta was probably the metagame I played the most, and it had a lot of old favorites of mine such as Honchkrow, Cofagrigus, and Sharpedo (Cofagrigus didn't move up until a bit later though). Teambuilding and battling was always a blast during that period. The very end of BW1 was probably the most balanced the metagame has ever been, with nothing really standing out as really overpowered in my opinion. There was a decent balance between all playstyles being viable, and because of how balanced everything was, it seemed like you could use almost anything with any shred of viability and make it work. Late BW1 was incredibly balanced and almost always fun to play. Today's metagame is sort of similar to that period, but with the loss of Pok&eacute;mon such as Cofagrigus, some buffs, and a few newcomers along with the freeing of Durant, it's a bit different and more offensively-leaning. Still though, I find the current metagame to be pretty fun.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Fascinating. It is known by many that your favorite Pok&eacute;mon to use in RU is Druddigon. What is it that makes you love it so?</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>Well, Druddigon is easily one of the most powerful and threatening Pok&eacute;mon in RU at the moment, and it fits on quite a few teams effectively due to its good overall stats, decent movepool, and Dragon typing (it has pretty much no competition as a fully evolved Dragon actually, as the other Dragons are either Altaria or NFE, although Fraxure has a niche as a DD user). Choice Band Druddigon has always been a monster, and it's a great Pok&eacute;mon to have just to punch holes in the opposing team and make it easier for something else to sweep. Of course, Stealth Rock and mixed sets are good too, but CB just takes the cake as the best set, in my opinion.</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>At this moment, a random person ran in and starting yelling about how terrible Druddigon is. Molk explained to me later that it was his friend who hated Druddigon with an extreme passion.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>RU is known for Fire/Water/Grass cores. Do you hope that this trend continues in the next generation?</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>FWG cores are always pretty solid and RU most definitely has a lot of them (almost half of the RU by usage Pok&eacute;mon can be part of a FWG core actually). I'm not sure if I specifically want the trend to continue into XY, but it's always pretty neat to have multiple cohesive FWG cores to work with that cover each other so well.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Were there ever any Pok&eacute;mon that you were upset to see leave the tier?</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>I'd have to say I was pretty annoyed that Cofagrigus left RU. Cofagrigus was one of those Pok&eacute;mon that was always solid and very effective; its offensive Trick Room set was always amazing despite having to take 2 turns to fully set up. It was great as both an offensive and defensive spin blocker and is probably the best defensive Ghost to ever enter RU as it kept a lot of annoying things in check too. Right now for bulky Ghost-types we have Spiritomb and Dusknoir, which aren't worth using.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Yeah, by the end of the format, we ended up with the short  end of the stick on Ghost-types. Were there any other types that you felt that RU needed more of?</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>The relatively low amount of Ground-types in the post-Nidoqueen meta was pretty annoying (the only Pok&eacute;mon in RU by usage that are Ground-types are Steelix, Sandslash, Quagsire, and Rhydon, two of which are really niche). That Electric-type immunity is pretty invaluable, especially when there are quite a few Electric-types running around, and I would've liked to see more in the tier. Of course, we could pick out Ground-types from NU too, most notably Golurk (fun fact: Golurk would essentially be RU by usage this month if we had one more tier shift, just barely missed out on the last chance it got); otherwise I never really had too much of a problem with type balance. There weren't too many Dragons, but perhaps that was for the better, especially when you look at how strong they are in the higher tiers.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Yeah... Well, at least NU community is happy. What was your favorite team that you made? Also, is it necessarily your best team that you made?</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>I don't really think I have one team that I like much more than all my others, but one notable team I liked a lot was probably my Trick Room team I used before Cofagrigus moved up. It was always pretty solid for me and I had quite a bit of success using it, especially considering that there are quite a few top-tier threats that either benefit from or set up Trick Room, such as Slowking and Druddigon. Trick Room + Healing Wish Mesprit made it all the better as I could bring any Pok&eacute;mon back from near death and go for another round; overall, really fun and effective team. I'm not sure if it was the absolute best team since it had problems with certain Dark-types such as Absol, but it was definitely one of the teams I played best with.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Thanks for all your great answers, Molk. So, RU ready to say goodbye?</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>At first, I wasn't too sure but XY most certainly seems interesting and fun to play, and I'm excited to see how it turns out in XY, so I guess I'm ready.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>See you later.</p></div>

<div class="speaker molk"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_molk.png" alt="molk" /><p>See ya.</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>After leaving Molk's Dojo, I approached what would be my final challenge: an interview with Oglemi. I approached his room, titled "Oglemi's (Better) Throne Room". The room had a quite gothic design, but it also had quite a few rainbows on its wall decorum. There was Oglemi, sitting on a throne made of swords with two Simisear sitting on both sides, both of which were glaring at me to make sure I didn't harm their master. Suddenly, Oglemi clapped his hands and a disco ball came from the ceiling. The room immediately became glittery and all the tension I had felt disappeared. After greeting Oglemi, I began the interview.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>So, what made you want to join and help RU get made?</p></div>

<div class="speaker oglemi"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_oglemi.png" alt="oglemi" /><p>I was a strong proponent of the creation of the tier from the beginning of BW, because with the past amount of Pok&eacute;mon available, NU was going to be over-flooded with Pok&eacute;mon, so the creation of another tier would allow for more Pok&eacute;mon to be used in a metagame where they'd be useful. I was an advocate for the creation of a tier in between UU and NU because "NeverUsed" made it seem like it would be the very last tier in the line of tiers if they were to be named. RU just happened to be the name that came up that seemed to fit best. I was also for the creation of another tier because UU actually had a really strong community in DPP, and Smogon is only growing so I knew that RU would be able to have a sustainable community of its own. I knew I was going to help out the community in any way I could since its inception, and I just kinda threw myself into the leadership position from the start and I pushed for its recognition as an official Smogon tier. I don't think there's a real reason I wanted to get so involved, but I just wanted to see it be successful given that I pushed so hard for its creation.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Do you feel that RU could've worked in any of the past generations?</p></div>

<div class="speaker oglemi"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_oglemi.png" alt="oglemi" /><p>No, not with the community available and the culture for side-tiers at the time; also, there simply weren't enough Pok&eacute;mon available for the tier to really work in the past generations. While it could be argued it would've worked in DPP, NU would have just the very bottom of the barrel Pok&eacute;mon like it was in ADV, and I don't think it would have been a very fun metagame or would have had a community behind it. Smogon has come an extremely long way in appreciating and recognizing alternate metagames to OU in the past couple years. RU would have never have gotten off the ground before BW.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Interesting. Were there any Pok&eacute;mon that you wish would've been in RU but were unable to be a part of the metagame?</p></div>

<div class="speaker oglemi"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_oglemi.png" alt="oglemi" /><p>Rhyperior is one that was only RU in Round 0; it would have been a really cool part of the metagame I think. Houndoom and Mismagius were really close to dropping near the end of BW and it would have been interesting to see the metagame develop around those two, though I'm not sure if they would have made the metagame better or worse. The unique thing about RU is that it has been fun almost the entire time since its creation, regardless of the Pok&eacute;mon available to it. Anything could have happened and it still would be the most fun tier. I don't think there are really any Pok&eacute;mon on a wish list that I would have liked in the metagame. Like I said, I think the tier would just be able to roll with it and adapt.</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>At this point, I noticed both of the Simisear were singing karaoke to The Bee Gees in the back corner. This basically distracted me for the whole interview.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Did you feel any particular Pok&eacute;mon that remained in RU should've been banned or moved up?</p></div>

<div class="speaker oglemi"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_oglemi.png" alt="oglemi" /><p>No. I've always leaned on the side of "the fewer the bans, the better". Even so, I don't think there was really anything that was left in the tier that needed to leave or be dealt with in the end. Honchkrow and Nidoqueen both probably could've been looked at again before moving up, but RU would still have been fine with them in the tier.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>What would you say were the best types in RU?</p></div>

<div class="speaker oglemi"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_oglemi.png" alt="oglemi" /><p>Grass, Bug, Fire, Dark, and Water&mdash;those were the top types throughout the existence of RU. Toward the end, Dragon became a top type as well, but that was solely on the shoulders of Druddigon so I'm not sure it actually counts, lol.</p></div>

<div class="speaker flavour"><p>In an attempt to lean over and see more of the two Simisear performing karaoke, I ended up falling over. I got up, straightened my suit, and made sure to pay more attention to the task at hand while Oglemi stared at me quizzically.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>What do you feel never got its due in RU?</p></div>

<div class="speaker oglemi"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_oglemi.png" alt="oglemi" /><p>Some of the biggest underdogs throughout RU were Bouffalant, Crawdaunt, and Klinklang; while they had their faults, I believe they were definitely good enough to see far more use than they did. Other examples would be the Dragons I used in my RMT Daenerys Storm, particularly Fraxure and Dragonair, as well as top Normal-types such as Zangoose and Tauros.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Do you feel that BW RU will be a tier that players will often return to in the future?</p></div>

<div class="speaker oglemi"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_oglemi.png" alt="oglemi" /><p>Very much so. Out of the BW tiers, most people only have good things to say about RU and NU. I feel they will always have tournaments and activities dedicated to them.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>What was your favorite Pok&eacute;mon to use in RU? Also, would you say your favorite Pok&eacute;mon to use is the best Pok&eacute;mon to use in RU?</p></div>

<div class="speaker oglemi"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_oglemi.png" alt="oglemi" /><p>My favorite Pok&eacute;mon to use in RU was Kabutops, followed closely by Rhydon. Kabutops, I would definitely say, was one of the best Pok&eacute;mon to throw on a team if you needed a hard hitter + a spinner in one. Rhydon definitely had its shortcomings but it was still a top-tier Pok&eacute;mon. It was also simply really fun to use.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Would you say the most fun part about BW RU was the ability to experiment?</p></div>

<div class="speaker oglemi"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_oglemi.png" alt="oglemi" /><p>Definitely, the variety is incredible in the tier and even obnoxiously gimmicky sets were still fun to use; they could win games if used right.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Lastly, RU ready to say goodbye?</p></div>

<div class="speaker oglemi"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_oglemi.png" alt="oglemi" /><p>I'm afraid so; it's sad to move on from BW RU but XY is shaping up to look really fun and I have a feeling XY RU will be just as fun as BW RU was, so I'm excited for it.</p></div>

<div class="speaker mack"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_mack.png" alt="mack_the_knife" /><p>Thanks for your time!</p></div>

<div class="speaker oglemi"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/ru_oglemi.png" alt="oglemi" /><p>mhm</p></div>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>After my departure, I got on a plane back to my country and wondered to myself the same question I had asked my interviewees over and over: RU ready to say goodbye? After hours of pondering, I came to this conclusion: yes. I'm excited about what this new generation has to offer RU (such as Toxicroak probably dropping from OU or the new addition of Pangoro), and knew that if I ever felt a sense of nostalgia for the past, I could always return and play a few games of BW RU just for fun. Let's look forward and make sure that XY RU is just as creative and fun as last gen.</p>
