[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 100% chance to lower the target's Speed by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Low Sweep has little competitive use outside of Pokemon with Technician. Its Base Power is too low, and it is outclassed by stronger moves. Even so, its secondary effect is somewhat useful, especially for catching fast switch-ins and temporarily crippling them, and Fighting is an extremely good attacking type in BW. Low Sweep is a popular choice on Pokemon with Technician, such as Breloom and Ambipom. For Technician users, Low Sweep is the whole package of power, reliability, coverage and packing an excellent effect.</p>
