Overview
########
- Technician + great movepool
- Its Bullet Seed is one of the strongest moves in the game (187.5 BP)
- Incredible base 130 Attack
- Base 70 Speed not that amazing
- Lackluster defenses
- Spore nerf hampers its utility slightly; Grass-types and Overcoat Pokemon now immune to Spore
- Its STABs are resisted by top-tier threats in the metagame (Mega Venusaur, Talonflame, Dragonite, etc.)
- Many common weaknesses to types such as Fire, Flying, and Ice


Physical Attacker
########
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Spore / Force Palm
move 2: Bullet Seed
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Rock Tomb / Force Palm
ability: Technician
item: Life Orb / Focus Sash
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========
- Takes advantage of Technician using low BP moves to hit super hard
- Spore incapacitates a foe and is useful for getting rid of something Breloom or the rest of the team can't handle as well. Also useful for getting check/counter neutered on the switch (unless Grass-type)
- Bullet Seed is Breloom's strongest STAB attack when Technician is considered. It can also break Sturdy and Focus Sash thanks to being multi-hit
- Mach Punch is useful STAB priority that also gets a Technician boost. Good for hitting weakened or faster Pokemon and hits quite hard
- Rock Tomb can get rid of or weaken popular threats like Talonflame or Dragonite on the switch, as well as slowing a few threats down to the point that Breloom can finish them off (Gengar, Latios)
- Force Palm is another STAB attack Breloom can use if Mach Punch just won't do and Breloom is faster or can take a few hits from the opposition. It is useful for hitting defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn or Mandibuzz. It can also be used over Spore because Mega Venusaur, a common threat, is immune to it, as are other Grass-types.


Set Details
========
- EVs maximize Attack and Speed
- Adamant is recommended for maximum power, though Jolly lets Breloom outspeed neutral invested base 70 Speed Pokemon or tie those with a positive nature.
- Life Orb maximizes power
- Jolly also outruns Adamant Mamoswine so it can Mach Punch before taking an Ice Shard
- Focus Sash can be used to guarantee a Spore early-game

Usage Tips
========
- Since Grass-types are immune to Spore, if you anticipate one of them is going to switch in, use a Fighting-type attack, or a coverage move if it resists Fighting.
- Using Spore on a predicted switch-in to a check or counter that isn't Grass-type is a great way to clear the path for a Breloom sweep
- Using Rock Tomb on a predicted switch-in slows the opponent's Pokemon, sometimes to the point where Breloom can outspeed and finish it off (in cases which it can't KO otherwise)
- Spore is also useful for neutering checks and counters of a teammate you are trying to support
- Used mostly mid-game for breaking walls or early-game to fire off a quick Spore and break things

Team Options
========
- Fire-type or teammate with Fire-type moves to get rid of Grass-types immune to Spore. Heatran is especially good because it resists Flying, as well as x4 resisting Ice and being immune to Poison.
- Stealth Rock setters to chip away at Fire- and Flying-type threats who have an easy time against Breloom
- Rock-types to take care of the above
- Hippowdon takes care of Aegislash, Dragonite, and Talonflame
- Excadrill is immune to Poison and can switch into all of Breloom's weaknesses bar Fire.


Leech Seed
########
name: Leech Seed
move 1: Leech Seed
move 2: Drain Punch
move 3: Protect
move 4: Rock Tomb / Spore
ability: Poison Heal
item: Toxic Orb
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========
- Leech Seed for chipping away HP from opponents while giving Breloom passive recovery for longevity
- Drain Punch is primary STAB attack
- Protect is good for Leech Seed stalling and basically gives you a free recovery turn, as well as doing consistent passive damage to your opponents
- Rock Tomb can be used on a predicted switch into a check or counter to this set, as it will slow it down and make it easier to handle by teammates or even Breloom itself
- Spore can be used instead of Rock Tomb; 100% accurate sleep move is always nice, though the Spore nerf means that Grass-types like Mega Venusaur can come in more easily


Set Details
========
- Poison Heal + Toxic Orb for a lot of recovery
- EVs and nature max out Breloom's stats towards HP and Special Defense to make it as great a special wall as possible.

Usage Tips
========
- Use Rock Tomb on an incoming check or counter to this set - it will slow down opposing Pokemon and make it easier to either KO with a coverage move or with a teammate
- The above tip work with Spore as well. It will put a switch-in to sleep and render it useless for a lengthy period of time. Just watch out for Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, as they are immune to Spore and Leech Seed

Team Options
========
- Fire-types like Heatran or Talonflame are great for handling the Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed and Spore
- Excadrill has good type synergy with Breloom and can spin hazards away
- Hazard setters like Smeargle or Forretress will force anything coming in to lose a chunk of HP

Other Options
########
- Swords Dance
- Poison Heal sets
- SubPunch
- Bulk Up
- Choice Band
- ThunderPunch (bypasses Skarmory and Gyarados)

- Talonflame (as well as Flying-types in general)
- Dragon-types (Dragon/Flying in particular) such as Dragonite
- Aegislash (resists both STABs - Breloom becomes setup bait)
- Gengar
