<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and lowers the user's Special Attack by two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Draco Meteor is a force to be reckoned with, thanks to its whopping 140 Base Power. As it is a Dragon-type move, it hits everything bar Steel-types neutrally, dealing high damage in the process. Thanks to its unfortunate effect of lowering the Special Attack of the user, it fits a hit-and-run playstyle, favored by Choice Specs and Choice Scarf users. It also has great distribution (every single Dragon-type Pokemon can learn it). This is the Dragon-type special move to use if power is preferred over consistency, and what makes some Dragon-types, such as Latios and Hydreigon, so especially terrifying to face.</p>
