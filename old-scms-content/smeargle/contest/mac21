[page]

<p>How would it look like if Pokemon were shown to be courageous, brave, or valiant? Showing them at their best, that is what the artists at Smeargle's Studio aimed to do. Which Pokemon is going to be portrayed as the hero? The villain? Who's the damsel in distress? This month's theme was all about capturing the essence of heroism!</p>
