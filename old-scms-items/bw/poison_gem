<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder uses a damage-dealing Poison-type move, then the holder consumes this item and the power of that move is increased by 50%. One-time use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In single battles, Poison Gem is not typically a useful item, unfortunately. While the one-time boost to Poison-type attacks is nice, most Pokemon using Poison-type attacks would rather have the more reliable power of Life Orb or Choice items.</p>

<p>Typically Gems are more valuable in the VGC and similar environments, and Poison Gem is rarely used here to boost the power of Poison-type attacks; however, given the poor coverage of most Poison-type attacks, it is possibly the least used of all the Gems, particularly as all the viable Poison-types have better STAB options they could be using. For those that do not have a choice, however, the one-time power boost can come in very useful in such a fast-paced metagame, especially as it comes without any drawbacks.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Occur randomly in Dust Clouds.</p>
