<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts user's Speed two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Being faster is very important in any RBY metagame. Agility helps you achieve that in one single move, making the user faster and more dangerous than anyone else on your team. Moreover, if you use Agility when your Pokemon is paralysed, the speed drop will be negated. This is very useful, given that spreading paralysis is the most common tactic in RBY OU. Agility is also part of the most deadly and annoying tactic&mdash;AgiliWrap is a tactic used by Dragonite that grants it an OU position when Wrap was not banned. Agility makes Dragonite the fastest OU Pokemon and lets it spam Wrap until everything is weak enough to to be picked off with Hyper Beams. The only check to this tactic is Gengar, which takes no damage but is still immobilized, so you can still use Wrap as a defensive pivot to get free switch ins.</p>
