<p>Tutoring Tournaments are going to be run concurrently every couple of rounds as a new addition to the Smogon Apprentice Program! These are meant to provide an opportunity for program participants to show off just how much they are learning from their mentors as well as build camaraderie between players. Apprentices are encouraged to take advantage of their tutor's team building and battling expertise throughout the tournament!</p>

<p>Due to time constraints, only the first 16 people who indicate interest in the Apprentice Program sign-up thread will be allowed to participate. Entire tutoring rounds last for only three weeks at a time, so do not be discouraged if you miss out. You can always try again the following round!</p>

<p>Please familiarize yourself with the rules below that are specific to Tutoring Tournaments:</p>

<ol class="long_list">
<li>Battles will be standard XY OU played on the main server of the Pokemon Showdown simulator.</li>
<li>Tournament rounds will last a maximum of one week. No extensions will be granted. It is up to the discretion of the tournament administrator to determine who will advance in the event of an incomplete match.</li>
<li>Pokemon that are considered "Uber" are banned from use on all teams. Smogon's tier list is supreme. Smogon's XY OU ban list can be found <a href="/dex/xy/tags/ou">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following clauses outlined in the ban list must be followed and enabled for all Tutoring Tournament matches.</p>
