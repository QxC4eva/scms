########

    Amazing offensive stats and great Speed in Mega form
    Awesome ability in Magic Bounce, so it can deter hazard and status use; also makes it immune to Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp
    Swords Dance and STAB Sucker Punch make it a frightening sweeper, especially with the fact that Steel doesn't resist Dark anymore
    Awesome offensive movepool, so it can hit many threats with great coverage
    Immense frailty is the nail in the coffin though
    Sucker Punch is very shaky and has low PP
    Absol needs to be in Mega Form to be viable

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Sucker Punch
move 2: Pursuit / Knock Off
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Play Rough / Superpower
item: Absolite
ability: Magic Bounce (Justified)
nature: Naive
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    This set makes use of Absol's great offensive movepool to smack around its opponents
    Sucker Punch is great STAB that hits very hard and has priority
    Pursuit is great to hit Pokemon wanting to flee from Absol
    Knock Off though provides a more reliable STAB move, and the item loss is big
    Fire Blast hits Aegislash, Ferrothorn, Forretress, etc.
    Play Rough hits Fighting-types as well as Dragons
    Superpower if one wants to use Knock Off, hits Heatran and Tyranitar which is cool


Set Details
========

    Naive nature is used to maximize Absol's Speed and allow it to utilize its great Special Attack in conjunction with that absurd Attack
    Absolite is necessary since Absol needs to mega evolve in order to be viable
    Iron Tail could be useful if you're scared of Fairies, but the accuracy is shaky


Usage Tips
========

    This Absol is a good revenge killer and trapper, using its power and speed to hit hard
    It also wallbreaks well with Knock Off, and its coverage helps in this as well
    Use it to wallbreak and revenge kill, and avoid trying to switch Absol into anything because it's frail
    Mega Evolve quickly since Absol's Mega Evolution is viable but not without its Mega Evolution


Team Options
========

    Aegislash is fine since it can come in on Fighting-types, Talonflame can also smash Fighting-types as well
    Fighting-types themselves can benefit from Absol breaking down Alakazam and Gengar
    Fairies are viable as well, Sylveon, Azumarill, and Gardevoir are all perfectly viable


Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Night Slash / Knock Off
move 4: Play Rough / Baton Pass
item: Absolite
ability: Magic Bounce (Justified)
nature: Jolly / Naive
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Swords Dance is also viable to make Absol a frightening sweeper, and its Sucker Punches are more fearsome than ever
    Sucker Punch is STAB that is priority, so Absol revenge kills
    Night Slash is a secondary STAB choice that is more reliable
    Knock Off is the more powerful choice that removes items but is illegal with Play Rough
    Play Rough hits Fighting-types such as Terrakion for great damage while
    Baton Pass is a very good move for Absol to escape from its counters and resort to a teammate, while allowing them to make use of its SD boost


Set Details
========

    Naive or Jolly to make use of Absol's Speed
    Magic Bounce is an incredible ability which blocks status and the likes
    Justified has occasional use before Mega Evolving, so Absol can switch into a Dark Pulse or Knock Off to get an Attack boost


Usage Tips
========

    It's a sweeper, and Magic Bounce should be used to allow it to set up on defensive threats
    Absol's frailty will get in the way, but being able to use things like Chansey as setup fodder is useful
    Mega Evolve quickly, since Absol is mediocre without its Mega Form

Team Options
========

    Counters to Fighting-types are great, Aegislash is a very good teammate
    Talonflame is also usable to smack around opposing Fighting-types like Keldeo
    Special attackers can be useful to pester physical walls, namely Pokemon like Scarf Gardevoir can be useful

Other Options
########

    Ice Beam is usable to hit Dragons like Garchomp and friends
    Has BoltBeam coverage overall
    Calm Mind
    Baton Pass
    Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are cool support moves but Absol's lack of bulk prevents it from making good use of the move
    A bunch of other moves that Absol has no time for


Checks & Counters
########

    Scarf Terrakion/Keldeo
    Sylveon
    Pick on its weak defenses
    Gamble with Sucker Punch, likely with Substitute
    Typically quite difficult to counter due to Sucker Punch
