Chlorophyll Sweeper
########
name: Chlorophyll Sweeper
move 1: Return
move 2: Seed Bomb
move 3: Jump Kick
move 4: Work Up / Wild Charge
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Life Orb
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

• STAB Return is quite powerful, OHKOing Meditite.
• Seed Bomb is the other STAB, and is super effective on Rock-types who resist Return.
• Jump Kick OHKOs Berry Juice Munchlax, who would stop this set with Fire Punch; it also hits Steels hard.
• Work Up is Deerling's only physical boosting move, and a +1 Deerling OHKOs or 2HKOs many other notable Pokemon, such as Vullaby.
• Wild Charge guarantees an OHKO on Fletchling after Rocks; Fletchling would otherwise KO with priority Acrobatics. It also lets Deerling get past Vullaby with some prediction.

Set Details
========

• EVs and Chlorophyll enable it to reach 34 Speed in Sun, letting it outspeed and OHKO +2 Carvanha.
• EVs maximize Speed and Attack, with 1 extra point of HP and Def
• Life Orb gives it enough power to get crucial KOs, such as Jump Kick on Munchlax.

Usage Tips
========

• Bring it in on anything lacking a super-effective or crippling move.
• Begin your sweep.
• Be careful when using Jump Kick, as Ghosts can switch in, causing you to lose half of your health.

Team Options
========

• Sun makes this set function; Vulpix is almost a required partner
• As Ghost-types are immune to half of this set's attacks, a way to defeat them, such as Pursuit trapping, is appreciated.
• Deerling is somewhat weak, so Knock Off users are appreciated, as they can remove Eviolites.
• Pawniard can perform both of the above tasks, but compounds weaknesses to (Sun-boosted) Fire and Fighting attacks.
• Slow VoltTurn users can also help get Deerling in safely.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Return
move 2: Seed Bomb
move 3: Wild Charge
move 4: Jump Kick
ability: Sap Sipper
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

• Return is very powerful, OHKOing Meditite.
• Seed Bomb is the other STAB, and is super effective on Rock-types who resist Return.
• Wild Charge hits Flying-types, such as Fletchling.
• Jump Kick OHKOs Berry Juice Munchlax, who would stop this set with Fire Punch; it also hits Steels hard.

Set Details
========

• With a Choice Scarf, it reaches 25 Speed, allowing it to outspeed most common scarfers.
• EVs maximize Speed and Attack, with 1 extra point of HP and Defense.

Usage Tips
========

• Switch into a suspected Grass-type attack, like if your opponent sends a Chespin in on your Chinchou.
• Gain the attack boost, putting you at +1/+1.
• Attack, trying to hit as much of their team at least neutrally as possible.
• You'll usually have only 1 shot to get the Attack boost, so it is best to use this later in the game.
• Be very careful when using Jump Kick, as Ghosts can switch in, causing you to lose half of your health. Do not be locked into it while your opponent has a Ghost-type.

Team Options
========

• Deerling is somewhat weak, so Knock Off users are appreciated, as they can remove Eviolites.
• Slow VoltTurn users also help get Deerling in safely.
• A Grass-weak Pokemon, like Goldeen, whose Lightningrod ability makes it only weak to Grass, which Deerling can switch into with Sap Sipper.


Other Options
########

• Double-Edge's MOAR POWARRR is not generally needed, but is an option, especially on the Choice Scarf set.
• SubSeed or support sets are possible, but done better by Cottonee, Foongus, and so on.
• A Baton Pass set with Agility and possibly Work Up is possible, but mostly outclassed by Torchic.
• Thunder Wave and Synthesis could be used on a support/defensive set.
• Toxic to hit unsuspecting walls, like Spritzee, on the switch-in.
• Synthesis could be used on the Chlorophyll set, as it rejuvenates 2/3 of your HP in the sun.
• GrassWhistle, but its accuracy is so bad that it's generally not worth it.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ghosts**: They are immune to Return, Deerling's most powerful attack, as well as Jump Kick; Phantump and Pumpkaboo also resist Seed Bomb and Wild Charge, and many ghosts can burn Deerling.

**Physical Walls**: Koffing and Spritzee aren't 2HKOd by anything, and can stall it out.

**Flame Body**: Pokemon with Flame Body can burn Deerling, stopping it cold. Larvesta gets a special mention for quad-resisting grass, resisting Jump Kick, and having recovery in Morning Sun, which is boosted by sun to 75%!

**Dwebble**: Can switch in, get back to full health, and attack with X-Scissor for a guaranted OHKO.

**Snover**: Changes the weather, resists Seed Bomb, outspeeds and OHKOs with Blizzard, but must watch out for Jump Kick on the switch-in.
