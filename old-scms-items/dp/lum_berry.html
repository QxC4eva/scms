<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cures freeze, sleep, poison, paralysis, burn, and confusion. Activates when the holder is afflicted with a status, or when a Pokemon acquires a Lum Berry (through Trick, Recycle, etc.) while afflicted with a status. If a Pokemon is suffering from both confusion and one of the major status ailments at the time it acquires a Lum Berry, it will be cured of both conditions. This item is consumed after use. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Flying-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Lum Berry is an extremely versatile item, curing every status ailment upon use. Because of its versatility, the Lum Berry can be used in a multitude of manners.</p>

<p>Offensively, a Lum Berry is used on Pokemon such as Salamence or Kingdra, in conjunction with the high-powered Dragon move Outrage. Since Outrage causes confusion after its two to three turn usage, holding a Lum Berry might be just the item to prolong a potential sweep. Defensively, a Lum Berry can act as a "status absorber" of sorts. For example, Metagross that are used specifically to counter Gengar may hold a Lum Berry to bypass the possible Hypnosis or Will-O-Wisp.</p>

<p>While the Lum Berry has definite benefits, downsides do exist. If the opposing team has no form of status, the Lum Berry is an essentially useless item to be holding defensively. Offensively, the Lum Berry provides no extra power boost to attacks, which might negate some possible KOs with a stat-boosting item.</p>
