Overview
########

With a very unique typing and outstanding defensive stats, Slowpoke easily distinguishes itself as one of the tier's most solid walls. Its ability, Regenerator, gives it a unique niche that allows it to switch in and wall a multitude of threats without sustaining too much damage in the long run. This, coupled with Slowpoke's high HP and Defense, useful resistance to Fighting, and access to support moves such as Thunder Wave, Slack Off, and Scald, makes Slowpoke a very difficult wall to muscle past. Unfortunately, Slowpoke does have quite a list of weaknesses and a pitiful Special Attack stat, making it relatively easy to defend against. Still, its bulk and longevity make it one of the tier's best walls.

Moves
========

Scald is Slowpoke's STAB attack of choice, being able to hit things decently hard and also potentially burn them. Slack Off is a reliable form of recovery, letting Slowpoke heal itself while continuing to wall the opposition. Thunder Wave can cripple offensive opponents, making it easier for teammates to handle them later. It also helps Slowpoke cripple Murkrow, something not many Psychic-types can do. Finally, Psychic is a secondary STAB move that hits the Fighting-types that Slowpoke walls for a fair amount of damage. It also hits Poison-types, an added bonus, and can help deter them from trying to inflict status on Slowpoke. Fire Blast can also be used in the last slot to nail Steel-, Bug-, and Grass-types that give Slowpoke problems, making it harder to switch into.

Set Details
========

This set's main goal is to wall physical attackers and act as a bulky tank to support Slowpoke's team. A high Defense stat and Regenerator make Slowpoke a very solid Pokemon that can be difficult to take down and almost impossible to wear down. With Scald and Thunder Wave, Slowpoke can easily wall and cripple loads of common powerhouses and outlast them. Slowpoke's longevity and ability to switch in many more times than its opponents make it a long-lasting support Pokemon that can easily sponge attacks and cripple offensive sweepers. Its typing also helps it wall Fighting-types, and it should be noted that Slowpoke is a solid counter to the best Fighting-type in the tier, Meditite. Unfortunately, the buff to Knock Off has made it slightly more risky to wall certain Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr, but Slowpoke can still get the job done. In addition, Slowpoke's weaknesses to common attacking types and attacks such as Volt Switch and U-turn make it difficult to wall many common top-tier threats.

Usage Tips
========

Because of its ability, Slowpoke can easily heal itself of most minor misplays. Despite this, Slowpoke isn't a Pokemon that can be used just randomly. It should be used against physical attackers that can't reliably and continuously hit it super effectively; good examples are Mienfoo, Meditite, and Murkrow. Once in, Slowpoke should cripple its opponent with either Scald or Thunder Wave, depending on the opponent. The EVs give Slowpoke a small boost in power, so Scald and Psychic will deal decent damage to anything they hit super effectively. If Slowpoke sustains too much damage or the opponent switches into a counter, Slowpoke can either heal itself with Slack Off or switch out and heal with Regenerator. It should be noted that Slowpoke should watch out for mixed attackers, as its Special Defense stat isn't very high and it is susceptible to repeated strong special STABs. Slowpoke also has to watch out for the now buffed Knock Off, which hits hard and cripples it.

Team Options
========

Slowpoke can easily fit into a multitude of defensive cores due to the fact that it doesn't fear switching out because of Regenerator. Grass-types are the best partners for Slowpoke, because they resist Grass and Electric, two types Slowpoke is weak to, and can use Slowpoke to absorb Fire- and Ice-type attacks. Notable Grass-types include Foongus and Ferroseed. The newly introduced Fairy-types also work well with Slowpoke. They can absorb Dark- and Bug-type attacks while Slowpoke kills Poison-types, the Fairies' bane. Spritzee gets a special mention, as it can provide Aromatherapy and Wish support for Slowpoke, two things that Slowpoke really appreciates. In general, Pokemon that can handle Grass-, Electric-, and Dark-types are ideal partners for Slowpoke. Pawniard also gets a mention as it has good type synergy with Slowpoke and appreciates paralysis support. Vullaby, too, gets a special mention as it can easily wall the things that Slowpoke can't, such as Tangela and Scraggy. Together, they can handle most of the tier aside from Electric-types, forming a very solid core.

Other Options
########

Slowpoke has a load of other options it can use. Yawn can be used to put troublesome opponents to sleep and force switches. It also makes Slowpoke difficult to switch into. Surf can work if Slowpoke wants more power at the cost of the ability to burn. Slowpoke can use Zen Headbutt if it chooses to attack physically, as its Attack stat is a bit higher. It can also run a neat Trick Room set, and while it doesn't have the power to take advantage of it effect, it does have the useful ability to switch in and out to set it up. Finally, Slowpoke can run Trick with a Choice item to try to catch a bulky opponent off guard.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: In general, Grass-types are the best answers to Slowpoke. They don't mind Scald or Psychic and can stomach paralysis. They can KO Slowpoke with Grass-type STAB attacks. However, certain Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Snover must watch out for Fire Blast, which will deal serious damage to them.
**Dark-types**: Dark-types are also scary. While they don't appreciate burns or paralysis, they can come in and Knock Off Slowpoke's Eviolite, removing much of its bulk and dealing tons of damage. Dark-types such as Carvanha and Pawniard can deal heavy damage with their super effective STAB attacks.
**Electric-types**: Electric-types get a mention as they are immune to Thunder Wave and don't mind sponging a few hits in order to KO Slowpoke. Chinchou is one of Slowpoke's best counters, as it can heal itself against Slowpoke's Thunder Wave and resists Scald. It can also heals its teammates of Slowpoke's status with Heal Bell. Magnemite too can switch in against Psychic and KO with Thunderbolt.
**Knock Off**: Knock Off is severely crippling to Slowpoke. Not only does it deal super effective damage, but also remove Slowpoke's Eviolite, severely reducing its bulk.
**Misdreavus**: Misdreavus can also give Slowpoke a lot of trouble with its super effective STAB Shadow Ball. It has to watch out for paralysis, however.
**Toxic**: Slowpoke in general doesn't mind Toxic, but it is a useful status condition to keep Slowpoke on its toes, putting a timer on it.
