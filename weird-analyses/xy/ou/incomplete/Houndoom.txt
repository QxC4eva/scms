    Fantastic 115 speed tier
    High special attack clocking in at 140
    Hits obscenely hard under the sun, thanks to Solar Power
    Competes against a very formidable Mega Charizard-Y as the mega sun sweeper
    Large upgrade to physical bulk when mega gives quite respectable 70/90/90 defenses
    Rather sparse offensive movepool, though enough to make work
    Stealth rock weakness coupled with Solar Power recoil incurs a large amount of residual damage against Houndoom

Moves
========

    As Drought is not permanent anymore self induced Sun allows Houndoom to act independently of sun support, as well as catching switch ins attempting to stop Solarbeam, such as Tyranitar, and Politoed.
    Fire Blast is your primary STAB. Under the sun, with Solar Power, an effective 2.25x boost is conferred, sweetly outdamaging a +2 boost
    Solarbeam acts as solid coverage breaking through water types, and rock types that otherwise wall you, of course the sun must be up for it to be effective
    Dark Pulse is a nice secondary STAB that can be applied to Fire and Grass resists
    Without any form of sun induction Hidden Power Fighting is solid coverage, and patches up a Tyranitar vulnerability, 2HKOing all but Assault Vest variants
    Destiny Bond instead of Dark Pulse allows Houndoom to take down a slower foe who can survive one of its hits and KO back, such as Heatran. Be careful as Solar Power induced death won't take hte foe with you, only them damaging you.
    Hidden power ground cleanly 2HKOs specially defensive Heatran, even without Solar Power boosts
    Not all move combinations are valid. Houndoom can take on a role of a 3 attack + Destiny Bond wall breaker, and hole puncher that requires Sun support. Solarbeam for coverage is not recommended on this set as you will have no way to reset your own sun making it very unreliable. A sunny day day set is the other role where Houndoom takes on a role of sun setter, utilizing powerful Fire Blasts, Solarbeam for coverage, and a secondary STAB or Destiny Bond which allows Houndoom to pick off an important sun counter while giving a few safe turns of sun for a teammate to work with.

Set Details
========

    Max Speed and Special attack optimize HOundoom's Sweeping ability, with a timid nature, as without a boosting nature a large number of important Speed tiers are missed
    4 Defense EVs as opposed to 4 HP gives more favorable hazard and solar power damage
    Flash Fire is the ideal ability as the Flash Fire boost persists after mega evolution, and gives Houndoom a free switch in if played correctly

Usage Tips
========

    With such power behind Fire Blast often resists, even bulky ones are cleanly 2HKO'd, there is no need to "overpredict"
    Trying to Solarbeam when an opposing Tyranitar, or Politoed is alive and well is tantamount to suicide, don't do that
    Unfortunately due to Solar Power recoil a lot of opponent 2HKOs are turned into 1HKOs, avoiding using turns setting up with teammate sun support allowing you to dodge hits and just deal damage improves survivability vastly.
    Houndoom's typing is convenient for beating ghosts that which spam will-o-wisp such as Sableye, Trevenant, these are perhaps the best switch in opportunities


Team Options
========

    Assault Vest Conkeldurr is a strong partner to Houndoom as it breezes through many of its checks and counters, while absorbing status targeted at Houndoom and receiving a guts boost

    Stealth Rock is a serious issue for HOundoom, and defog/rapid spin support is a fantastic option, Scizor performs this relatively well as it lures Will-o-wisp and offensive fire moves for HOundoom's flash fire, as well Scizor is a reasonable switch into one of Houndoom's best counters; Tyranitar
    Drought Ninetales, especially with a heat rock gives Houndoom a huge amount of power without any need for set up
    Landorus-therian is excellent at absorbing strong ground, and fighting moves aimed at Houndoom, while also taking some Rock-type moves comfortably. Landorus-therian can defeat Talonflame as well.
    Pokemon that attract Will-o-wisp burns blend well with Houndoom's Flash Fire allowing for an initial switch in and a nice power boost. Due to Houndoom's typing it can beat a number of fire and ghost types that use Will-o-wisp, such as Sableye, easily.

Other Options
########

    Taunt is a solid move for nearly any pokemon, and can allow Houndoom to beat some pokemon that would otherwise beat Houndoom with Status moves. If taunt is elected, it is ideal on a Nasty Plot set, as turns taken to taunt and defeat defensive pokemon that can not be muscled past with just one attack or two will cause the Sun to expire, and recoil damage to accumulate
    Sucker Punch is Houndoom's only option for priority, and can mitigate issues against opposing priority and choice scarf users
    Nasty Plot is a solid, and straightforward way to buff up Houndoom's Special Attacks, however in general it isn't hard enough to check, thus the immediately stronger Sunny Day set that supports the team, or a set that uses sun support itself to simply start knocking out opponents is far more efficient.
    Nasty Plot on top of sun, especially with a flash fire boost grants utterly absurb power behind MEga Houndoom's Fire Blasts, however the support, number of turns and Recoil involved with this makes it nearly impractical.
    Will-o-Wisp screws with some switch ins, Tyranitar and Terrakion most prominently, however some others like Heatran and Guts Conkeldurr can benefit from it.


Checks & Counters
########

    Strong Scarfers with super effective coverage moves: Garchomp, Salamence, Keldeo, Terrakion
    Strong priority moves with super effective damage: Vaccuum wave Lucario, Mach Punch Breloom, Mach Punch Conkeldurr, Aqua Jet Azumarill.
    Tyranitar replaces sun with sand, resists dual STAB, and has the bulk to take anything else while retaliating with Stone Edge
    Blissey / Chansey sponge almost anything and cripple with status
    Terrakion, Hydreigon, Greninja, Keldeo resist Dual STAB, however Solarbeam, and Hidden power fighting, as well as sun boosted Fire Blasts will sting
    Banded Talonflame cleanly OHKOs after any residual damage prior
    Protect users really screw with Houndoom thanks to Solar Power recoil, and stalling out precious turns of Sun
    Stealth Rocks put a huge dent in Houndoom's lasting power
