[Overview]

<p>The better of the two Nidos, Nidoking has good Attack and decent Special, so he can make his awesome movepool work better. However, it's hard to switch him in in standard play because his typing really hurts himâ€”with weaknesses against moves like Earthquake, Blizzard, and Psychic. If you do switch him in and predict well though, he can do some damage because he has so many options.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Blizzard
move 3: Thunder / Thunderbolt
move 4: Body Slam

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Unlike most Ground-types, Nidoking can use special attacks well; he also has less Attack and Defense than most Ground-types. To use the set best, try to predict what your opponent will switch into Nidoking and damage it with a super effective attack. Nidoking can cover some of its weaknesses with Blizzard for Exeggutor, Thunderbolt or Thunder for Starmie, and Body Slam for Alakazam. Thunder on Nidoking isn't a bad idea because it's a 2HKO on Starmie and a 3HKO on Slowbro.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Surf can be used against Rhydon and Golem. Ice Beam can work as an alternative to Blizzard if you're feeling unlucky or you want more PP. Rock Slide can work against Flying-types, especially against Moltres, Articuno, and Charizard. If OHKO moves aren't banned, Horn Drill is a good option.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Alakazam and other Psychics are at the top of Nidoking's counter list, even though they should all beware when switching in. Starmie and Slowbro wouldn't want to switch into a Thunderbolt, much like how Exeggutor wouldn't want to switch into a Blizzard. Other Water-types such as Lapras and Vaporeon counter Nidoking well too since they have enough HP to handle Nidoking's attacks and then fire back with STAB Blizzards and Surfs, respectively.</p>
