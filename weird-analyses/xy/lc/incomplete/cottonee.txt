Checks and Counters
########
Poison Types such as Grimer and Tentacool
Tentacool also has liquid ooze which can damage cottonee with a switch in to Leech Seed
Natu completely walls Cottonee with its magic bounce
Grass types such as Tangela, Foongus, and Ferroseed can switch in undisturbed and Cottonee can only taunt them
Abra is immune to Cottonee's passive damage thanks to magic guard
Sap Sippers such as Blitzle, Deerling, and Goomy can switch in and nab an attack boost. Goomy however, fears Cottonee's dazzling gleam and does not need the attack boost anyway, as it is normally physically offensive.
Snover is particularly dangerous as it can switch in on a Stun Spore and destroy Cottonee with a STAB Blizzard.
Fletchling is a major threat as it can take out Cottonee in one hit with a gale wings STAB acrobatics
