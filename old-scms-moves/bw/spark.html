<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to paralyze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Spark lost its lone competitive niche as Luxray's only usable STAB attack when Wild Charge was introduced this generation. Its 30% paralysis rate is neat and all, but you'll almost always want the larger Base Power Wild Charge provides.</p>
