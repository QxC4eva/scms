<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/376.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Metagross</strong> @ Occa Berry<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Meteor Mash<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Explosion</p>

<p>Very standard lead at the moment...I had a lot more success with it a few months ago when Azelf was the big dog but now people have caught onto it and his impact has been limited a bit. I think the main advantage this had was that many people expected Stealth Rock or Trick and seldom expected to be smacked by 405 Atk in the first turn.
</p>

<p>Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch gets Azelf and Aero out of the way early, whilst EQ + BP in conjunction with Occa Berry puts LeadApe on his arse. Other common leads like Tyranitar, Gengar and Jirachi all lose out. The only common lead I ever really switch out of is Bronzong. The Fire-resist berry also occassionally allows me to catch out a Scarftran who might otherwise give Infernape problems later. After taking out the opponent's lead, I'll look to use Explosion on anything worthwhile. A true suicide lead.</p>

<p><strong>Starmie</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 160 HP / 40 Def / 92 SpA / 216 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Surf<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>Starmie will always have a special place in my heart but this is the teamslot I've always been the least comfortable with. Salamence is such a key member of this team that I'd really rather keep SR away. It's also bad news for Infernape who is already delicate enough. Only one of my team resists Spikes and I hate TS so I feel a Spinner is necessary.</p>

<p>She's excellent at switching into random assortments of threats and forcing them away or just generally stalling against something like Vaporeon or Blissey till an opening comes up. Most importantly perhaps, she counters DD LO Gyara thanks to the defensive investment, and handily deals with enemy Infernape.</p>

<p>With the already high usage of CBTar and the increase in popularity of CBScizor, I think this is the last time in the foreseeable future that I'll have a Starmie on one of my teams. Having said all that, she has been a great team member.</p>

<p><strong>Salamence</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Hydro Pump</p>

<p>That's right - Specsmence! I'll occassionally have people shout at me and call me a noob for using this over the admittedley superior DDMence or MixMence but that's usually just because they're bitter that their switch-in just got OHKO'd. I'll usually take every chance to switch this guy in and start raining death down on the opponent. Tbh, I rarely predict with this guy and just rely on the Dragon attacks. They're so powerful that even Steel types lose huge chunks of their health. Interestingly enough Hydro Pump sees a lot more use than Fire Blast here. It's neutral coverage and high base power make it a great choice when I'm in a tough spot.</p>

<p>I do die a little inside when I get walled by Blissey though so I did test out DM/FB/BB/Roost MixMence for a week or so and found him to be very effective but his lack of a consistent sweeping attack led me to make the decision to go back to Specsmence and his formidable Dragon Pulse.</p>

<p>Intimidate is massively helpful in all sorts of situations.</p>

<p><strong>Swampert</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Torrent<br />
EVs: 200 HP / 228 Def / 80 SpA<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Swampert is such a fantastic Pokemon and functions as the lynchpin of the team and my "go-to-guy." Very rarely fails to lay Stealth Rock unless I get stung by a surprise HP Grass from Heatran or Zapdos. Stealth Rock is obviously incredibly important to both Scizor and his U-Turn and Infernape. Not much to say here, you all know how this guy rolls.</p>

<p>Hydro Pump gets the nod here as it allows him to combat Rotom formes a little better (usually 3HKOs whereas Surf 4-5HKOs and Waterfall is just crap against a Poke that spams WoW). Sometimes I get to unleash a Torrent boosted Hydro Pump which packs a lot more power than most people are used to seeing from a Swampert.</p>

<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 208 HP / 252 Atk / 40 SpD / 8 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Pursuit</p>

<p>Another set that has decreased in effectiveness as it becomes more and more popular. I wouldn't be surprised if next months usage stats show that the Choice Band set has surpassed the SD set...it is far more effective after all. Pursuit takes care of the usual suspects that completely shut down Infernape such as Starmie and even Tentacruel and stops Gengar from his revenge-killing duties. U-Turn chips away at Pokemon such as Zapdos, Rotom and Gyarados to put them in Infernape's KO range. Bullet Punch is insurance against a lot of sweepers and a fantastic one at that. Superpower doesn't see much use except on the odd Blissey who wants to stay in and Flamethrower me.</p>

<p><strong>Infernape</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Blaze<br />
EVs: 12 Atk / 252 SpA / 240 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Grass Knot<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>If Carlsberg made Pokemon it would probably be this chimp right here. The best late game sweeper since Deoxys-E in my opinion. Most importantly, he doesn't require any set-up (note that my team has zero set up Pokemon as I have came to question the value of set-up moves in Plat). I hold this guy back for as long as possible then break him out when I can see the opponent is defenseless against him. Flamethrower over Fire Blast and I have never once regretted that choice...by the time 'Ape comes out the opponent is usually sufficiently weakened that Flamethrower can do everything that Fire Blast can. </p>

<p>EVs are a little different here. This dude lands at 342 Speed, one point ahead of the old standard 'Ape who runs at 341 (I understand people are starting to run 330 now so I might change that sometime). This is mainly because I'm quite weak to enemy Mixape myself if the foe manages to Pursuit away my Starmie so it's nice to have a revenge killer.
