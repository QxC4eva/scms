<h2>History</h2>

<p>Zapdos, hands down the best of the original legendary trio, has been one  of the top OU Pok&eacute;mon throughout each of the previous four generations.  BW was not kind to Zapdos, however, as the shiny new Thundurus usurped  its role as the premier Electric-type special attacker; even though it  has since been voted Uber, Zapdos's fall to UU is yet to be reversed.  This is probably due to the fact that many common OU Dragon-types, such  as the Lati twins and Hydreigon, have little trouble dealing with it due  to its lower Speed and lack of access to Focus Blast, respectively. If  not that, perhaps it's simply because OU players have failed to  recognize its excellence. Either way, the fact that Zapdos is now one of  the most dangerous Pok&eacute;mon in UU remains true, and you should always  keep this in mind when building your team.</p>

<h2>Zapdos's Qualities</h2>

<p>Zapdos is one of those Pok&eacute;mon that you  simply won't find many flaws with, no matter how hard you look. Defensively, its Electric / Flying  typing is a blessing that grants it only two weaknesses, a multitude of  useful resistances, and an immunity to the ubiquitous Earthquake. Its  ability, Pressure, lets it stall out low-PP moves such as Heracross's  Stone Edge, while its decent 90 / 85 / 90 defensive stats give it plenty  of opportunities to switch in and wreck havoc. Offensively speaking, it  gets even better, as Zapdos has access to a ridiculously strong STAB  Thunderbolt and excellent coverage moves in Heat Wave and Hidden Power,  all of which hit extremely hard off its incredible base 125 Special  Attack and base 100 Speed stats. In case you haven't already figured it  out, this means Zapdos is more than capable of using both defensive and  offensive sets, making it hard to play around when it first hits the  field. All in all, the god of thunder is a true terror to face in  battle.</p>

<h2>Playing with Zapdos</h2>

<p>When playing with offensive Zapdos sets, your main priority should be to  make sure it switches in safely. You can then proceed to blow up the  opposing team with its awesome power and coverage, using Roost whenever  it gets a chance and needs to heal up. Defensive sets play differently,  as they check or counter specific threats, and either spread status or  use Roar to shuffle opponents around and take advantage of hazards laid  down by teammates. The physically defensive set is a great check to physical threats such as Heracross, Honchkrow, and Machamp,  especially since it can take advantage of Pressure to stall out their low-PP moves, such as Stone Edge and Sucker Punch. The specially  defensive set makes for an excellent check to Pok&eacute;mon such as Shaymin  and Yanmega and has a much easier time switching into and phazing out  Water-types and Calm Mind users; it can also check many other threats by virtue of its typing alone.</p>

<h2>Playing against Zapdos</h2>

<p>Unless you carry Snorlax, Toxic Umbreon, or Raikou, trying to counter  Zapdos is probably going to be an uphill battle. In the likely scenario  that you lack one of these, the first thing you should to is try to  figure out which Hidden Power it carries; Grass and Ice are the most  common, but Flying and Water are also seen occasionally. A good way to  do this is to switch a Pok&eacute;mon weak to a certain Hidden Power type into a  Thunderbolt, then immediately switch to another Pok&eacute;mon that resists  the specific type as it uses Hidden Power in an attempt to kill off the  first switch-in. Once you know its exact moveset, you can proceed to  make more calculated switches in order to prevent it from tearing your  team apart. If Zapdos carries Hidden Power Grass, then Flygon and Toxic  Gligar can take it on pretty easily; on the other hand, if it's a Hidden  Power Ice variant, then Swampert and specially defensive Rhyperior can  take it on pretty handily. Keep in mind, however, that some of these  checks, namely Gligar and Swampert, will get stalled out by defensive  sets with Toxic, so it's always a good idea to carry other means of  dealing with those.</p>

<h2>Fitting Zapdos onto your Team</h2>

<p>As long as your team isn't already stacked with Pok&eacute;mon weak to Rock or  Ice, getting Zapdos to do work for you should not be a problem at all.  Nevertheless, like any Pok&eacute;mon, providing it with the appropriate  support and teammates will ensure Zapdos maximizes its utility every  game.</p>

<p>The biggest, and possibly only, negative thing about Zapdos is its  weakness to Stealth Rock. The best way to remedy this, of course, is to  pair it with a Rapid Spin user. Blastoise and Hitmontop both have a  decent amount of defensive synergy with Zapdos, as the former is able to  switch into Ice-type moves aimed at it, while the latter can switch  into Rock-type ones. Both of them also have access to Foresight, which  makes the removal of the floating stones almost guaranteed. Another  issue that plagues primarily offensive variants of Zapdos is Sand  Stream. While 6.25% might not seem like much at first, after a while  you'll realize that this added residual damage forces Zapdos to Roost  more often, which, in turn, costs it quite a few turns where it could be  attacking. Unfortunately, unless you also happen to be running  something like Rain Dance Kingdra or Sunny Day Arcanine, there's not  much you can do about this. Finally, as previously mentioned, any  variant of Zapdos can make very good use of entry hazards set up by its  teammates. Offensive Zapdos appreciates the residual damage on opponents  so that they crumble to its attacks even more quickly; defensive  variants, on the other hand, can very easily take advantage of Roar to  spread said hazards damage for another teammate to sweep.</p>

<p>Offensively speaking, pairing Zapdos with Raikou forms what is probably  one of the most brutal offensive cores in the entire metagame. Keeping  up with either one of them individually is already hard enough as it is,  but stopping both of them is virtually impossible, especially when you  consider they weaken the other's checks. Shaymin is another excellent  offensive partner, but for a different reason—it's one of the few  Pok&eacute;mon with the ability to threaten almost every single one of Zapdos's  checks or counters in one way or another. Swampert, Rhyperior, and  Gligar are all straight-up demolished by Shaymin, while dedicated  special walls such as Snorlax and Umbreon will be forced to switch  into it to take its hits and risk a potential 2HKO, thanks to the 40%  Special Defense drop rate that Shaymin's Seed Flare is so famous for.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Whether it's spreading status and entry hazard damage with a defensive  set or relentlessly sweeping teams with its amazing offensive set,  Zapdos is definitely one of the top Pok&eacute;mon in the current UU metagame.  As said before, the only time you shouldn't consider Zapdos for a spot  on your team is when you're already loaded with Ice and Rock weaknesses,  but even then, you may want to consider Zapdos over one of those other  Pokemon—it's really that good. So, what are you waiting for? Go and see  for yourself just how devastating the god of thunder can really be!</p>
