[SHORT DESC]
Doubles the effect of status boosts and drops. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>Whenever this Pokémon has a stat boost or drop, it acts as if it is twice that many levels. One boost would act as two boosts, two boosts would act as four boosts, etc. The user can still only have a max of six effective boosts; no effect will be noticed from fourth or higher boosts. The same applies to stat drops. If this Pokémon is Baton Passed to, the boosts received are affected by this ability. If it uses Baton Pass, the boosts return to normal.</p>
