<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There are several instances in competitive Pokemon in which one member of an evolutionary family struggles to stand out while another member of that same family is a top-tier threat. In some families, such as those of Ferrothorn and Conkeldurr, all of the members of their evolutionary line are worth using in competitive battling. However, there are some families in which only one Pokemon is good in its own right, but its other family members are less fortunate when it comes to the battlefield. This third installment of "Viability Doesn't Always Run In The Family" will cover a few more specific examples of this. First-stage evolutions play in the Little Cup tier, which is where their viability will be analyzed. In addition, their fully evolved counterparts will be evaluated on their performance in the most played tier: Overused.</p>

<h4>Meowth</h4>

<p>At first glance, Meowth may seem like a very weak and simple creature, with its somewhat limited movepool and poor stats. However, a closer look at the way it functions yields that there is certainly more to Meowth than meets the eye. It reaches the 19 speed tier, which is highly significant in Little Cup, and it also gets Fake Out, which is boosted by its Technician ability; this adds up to be quite a chunk of damage after factoring in STAB as well, which is boosted even further if Life Orb is equipped. The fact that so many boosts can be stacked into one attack that has +3 priority and a 100% flinch rate makes Meowth the greatest abuser of chip damage in the tier, and the opponent doesn't even get to hit back while this is being carried out. Another approach Meowth can take is with Normal Gem, which activates when Fake Out is used and then frees up Meowth's item slot so that it can use Covet, which also benefits from STAB and Technician, to steal what its opponent is holding.</p>

<p>Being the Normal-type attack that Fake Out is, there are obviously targets that aren't affected by it or don't mind it very much (those being Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types), but Meowth is gifted with other things that let it get around them. Knock Off is a nasty surprise for any Ghost-type hoping to avoid damage from Meowth's STAB attacks, and its access to U-turn combined with 19 Speed lets Meowth easily pivot out of anything it can't take advantage of, while bringing in a teammate more suited for the situation. Meowth's ability to take hits is absolutely horrible, but that isn't what it's designed for. It's designed to get a huge chunk of free damage with Fake Out, use its high Speed to U-turn out so it can avoid damage and improve one's matchup, and come back in later to continue the process. Its access to Knock Off to remove items and punish Ghost-types is just icing on the cake. Meowth isn't a top-tier threat, but it's good enough at what it does to let it make a great impact if used properly, at least until it evolves...</p>

<h4>Persian</h4>

<p>Persian is a sad case; its good Speed is one of the only things it has going for it. It has a great movepool and even Technician to boost a few of its weaker coverage moves, but its base 70 Attack and base 65 Special Attack are just not going to do the job. For perspective, Persian's Silk Scarf Return has a chance of failing to 2HKO Keldeo. Base 115 Speed is good to have versus offensive teams, but the problem is that Persian is likely not going to OHKO its opponent, meaning that there is a high chance it will be taken out due to its pitiful 65 / 60 / 65 bulk. It has Taunt too, but Persian isn't breaking walls anytime soon so it really just has to U-turn out of them.</p>

<p>Persian's biggest problem is that there's pretty much no reason to use it over Greninja. Greninja's coverage, while not quite as good as Persian's, is still plenty good enough. Additionally, Greninja is a bit faster, bulkier, and hits way harder. Like Persian, Greninja can learn Taunt and U-turn, but it prefers being really annoying to offensive teams because it actually checks a lot of offensive Pokemon. Ultimately, Persian will continue to be NU, as it has been for a while, with its only potential rise to glory being a really good Mega Evolution.</p>

<h4>Ponyta</h4>

<p>Ponyta is easily the most reliable and self-sufficient offensive Fire-type in Little Cup, boasting a godly 19 Speed stat and carrying a nuke in Flare Blitz that hits every bit as hard as Murkrow's Brave Bird did, down to the decimal. It can make conventional use of Will-O-Wisp to cripple physically inclined enemies, and it definitely has the Speed to get it off before the foe can move in the vast majority of cases. It has reliable coverage in Wild Charge for giving Water-types a nice shock, and it also has Morning Sun as reliable recovery to help it take hits as well as deal with Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>In addition to Ponyta's already impressive offensive prowess, it can use Sunny Day to make its Flare Blitz even more dangerous while also aiding it with its weakness to Water. Morning Sun also recovers more health in harsh sunlight. Even though Ponyta's specially offensive potential is subpar compared with what it can do physically, it can also run an effective Solar Beam set with Sunny Day, giving it a powerful Grass-type coverage attack that obliterates all three types that give Fire-types problems. With great Speed, offensive power, and recovery, Ponyta is one of the all-around best Pokemon in Little Cup, and it is also the Pokemon with the highest base stat total of all Pokemon in the tier as of Misdreavus's somewhat recent ban.</p>
  </div>

<div class="interview-speaker mattl">
<img src="/smog/issue36/interview-mattl.png" alt="mattl" />
<h4>Rapidash</h4>

<p>The fire horse unfortunately loses a lot of its flair upon evolution, though. On paper, Rapidash doesn't look completely horrible. Base 105 Speed certainly isn't bad when coupled with a usable base 100 Attack, and it also has access to nice attacks in Flare Blitz, Wild Charge, and Megahorn. In practice though, Rapidash is underwhelming. Due to a weakness to Stealth Rock and tendency to take lots of recoil, often times Rapidash is in a "kill or be killed" situation, especially due to subpar 65 / 70 / 80 bulk. Life Orb and Choice items are the best choices for offensive Pokemon such as Rapidash, but Rapidash doesn't appreciate taking even more recoil or having to switch after being locked into a move when Stealth Rock is down.</p>

<p>Although Rapidash has some neat tools, there's no reason to use it in OU. It's checked by so many common Pokemon on offense such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Greninja, Azumarill, and even Latias. Although it has a solid amount of power, it still has plenty of counters such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Gliscor. Flash Fire is a nice ability, but it doesn't make up for the many flaws that prevent Rapidash from being a Pokemon that should be used in OU.</p>

<h4>Archen</h4>

<p>Despite what might appear at first glance to be a bad Pokemon with a horrible ability and a subpar typing, Archen is actually quite the commodity in Little Cup. With a colossal base 112 Attack and a Speed stat that maxes out at 17, it poses a certain offensive threat to the majority of the metagame. Berry Juice is a very handy item for Archen that accomplishes three things: it restores its health, pulls Archen out of Defeatist range after being taken to below half its maximum HP, and it doubles the power of its Acrobatics after consumption, which then allows it to steamroll through many important Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Foongus and deal heavy damage to others. Earthquake as offensive coverage crushes most Pokemon that resist Acrobatics, and Archen even has access to U-turn to maintain momentum as it forces switches with its great offensive presence. Last but not least, Archen is a good controller of entry hazards, having access to both Defog and Stealth Rock. Eviolite sets can utilize Roost to maintain health and to keep Defeatist from getting the best of Archen.</p>

<p>Fletchling and Diglett form a highly potent offensive core that can really mess with players; the idea is that Fletchling's offensive presence and its Gale Wings-assisted Acrobatics threat lures in Flying-resistant Pokemon, and all Flying-resistant types are weak to Ground. Fletchling uses U-turn as they switch in, and then pivots out to Diglett, which traps and kills them with a super effective Earthquake, thereby removing the team's Fletchling answer so that it can freely sweep. What makes Archen's typing so great is that it resists Flying but is also immune to Diglett's Earthquake and Arena Trap, being able to handle the core single-handedly in the vast majority of cases. Archen's Rock typing also warrants it a use on teams for new reasons as well: the ban of Misdreavus from the tier has given rise to Normal-type hard-hitters in Bunnelby and Zigzagoon, and having a Normal resist around is definitely handy to check those.</p>
  </div>

<div class="interview-speaker mattl">
<img src="/smog/issue36/interview-mattl.png" alt="mattl" />
<h4>Archeops</h4>

<p>The few important defensive qualities Archen has in its playground become obsolete once it achieves evolution. In Archeops' defense, it would likely be usable in OU if it had just about any other ability. It has fantastic offensive capabilities, but is put into Defeatist range too easily by its mediocre defensive typing and less than stellar bulk. Because of this, and especially due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Archeops has trouble switching into nearly anything without Defeatist activating, which limits how well Archeops can be used in battle.</p>

<p>Additionally, OU has too much priority that makes Archeops' good Speed irrelevant. Archeops has the unfortunate quality of being weak to Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Bullet Punch, but pretty much every priority attack seen in OU brings Archeops into Defeatist anyway. Archeops definitely has the potential to punch holes in teams and clean up; it's just the fact that it's massively crippled way too easily, making it not worth the effort.</p>
  </div>

<div class="interview-speaker briyella">
<img src="/smog/issue36/interview-briyella.png" alt="bri" />
<h4>Cleffa</h4>

<p>Azurill and Igglybuff are horrible, but at least they have abilities that are helpful to them and a unique immunity to Shadow Ball. To put it bluntly, Cleffa is by far the worst Fairy-type in Little Cup and is outclassed in every way possible by better Pokemon in the tier. Cleffa's stats are absolutely horrendous; its bulk is not that great, its Speed is literally equal to that of Slowpoke, and its offensive capabilities don't go far beyond a good special movepool that it can't make good use of. Even Flabebe, a Fairy that's totally outclassed by Spritzee, is a better choice as a Fairy-type than Cleffa, and both of its abilities are useless outside of Double battles.</p>

<p>Magic Guard is a great ability that makes all indirect damage have no effect on its bearer. However, it's not nearly enough to salvage Cleffa when just about every decently powered attack in the tier easily 2HKOes it; it doesn't have the Speed or power to dish out decent enough damage in retaliation. Cute Charm is never good to rely on in serious battles and Friend Guard has no use in singles. Sadly, Cleffa's stake in the pit of forgotten Little Cup Pokemon is going to be there for a long time.</p>
  </div>

<div class="interview-speaker mattl">
<img src="/smog/issue36/interview-mattl.png" alt="mattl" />
<h4>Clefable</h4>

<p>It might be surprising how a Pokemon with such mediocre stats is a top threat in OU, but if you underestimate Clefable, it very well might end up sweeping you. Fairy is a really good defensive typing, and any good team has easy answers to the Pokemon which utilize the somewhat uncommon Steel- and Poison-type attacks. Clefable also has two fantastic abilities in Magic Guard and Unaware, both of which have their uses depending on what the team needs. Although there are other Pokemon that do it better, Clefable can be a viable choice as a Stealth Rock setter or cleric due to its access to Heal Bell, Wish, and Soft-Boiled.</p>

<p>Where Clefable really shines, though, is as a Calm Mind user. 95 / 73 physical bulk isn't fantastic, but it's just good enough to do the job with correct investment. Due to its good typing, abilities, and reliable recovery, Clefable can set up on a surprising number of Pokemon. To top it off, Clefable can learn Flamethrower, which stops many of its would-be counters. It's still walled by Heatran, but fortunately Heatran doesn't have reliable recovery, making it a little easier for Clefable's teammates to wear it down. Overall, Clefable is a Pokemon that can fit well on offense, balance, and stall teams. Its stats aren't great, but just about everything else about it is, making it one of the better Pokemon in OU.</p>
  </div>

<div class="interview-speaker briyella">
<img src="/smog/issue36/interview-briyella.png" alt="bri" />
<h4>Happiny</h4>

<p>Happiny has great special bulk and a handful of support options, which might initially make it seem like a solid choice for a Little Cup team. However, it's totally nonviable for a long list of reasons. Happiny's role as a cleric is hindered by the fact that it doesn't have access to Wish, whereas many Little Cup clerics do. Additionally, Happiny is totally outclassed as a bulky Normal-type by both Lickitung and Munchlax. Lickitung has Wish, much greater overall bulk, and Knock Off, while Munchlax's stats are all higher than Happiny's with the exception of Speed, which it doesn't mind being without; Munchlax is also a commendable offensive force with a nice base 85 Attack. Spritzee also largely outclasses Happiny as a bulky cleric, having Wish, better allocated stats, and a better defensive typing. As a result, Happiny is not recommended for use on a Little Cup team at all... it just has nothing going for it that other things don't already do notably better, and there's not much else to be said about it as far as its viability in Little Cup.</p>
  </div>

<div class="interview-speaker mattl">
<img src="/smog/issue36/interview-mattl.png" alt="mattl" />
<h4>Chansey</h4>

<p>Things change with Happiny evolves, however. Chansey isn't even the final evolution, but its ability to use Eviolite to augment its bulk makes it much better than Blissey, even with the increased prevalence of Knock Off. Chansey continues to be a staple on OU stall with its titanic bulk. The Chansey line has problems with physical defense, but with full investment, a Bold nature, and Evoilite, Chansey has plenty of bulk on the physical side, while still losing only about 30% of its health from a Modest, Choice Specs Kingdra's Hydro Pump in rain. It completely walls a pretty decent fraction of the tier.</p>

<p>Chansey has two forms of reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled and Wish, two reliable ways to heal itself of status in Heal Bell and Natural Cure, and is a good user of Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and Toxic. Although Chansey has just about no offensive presence, Seismic Toss is usually enough to do the job unless it's up against something with reliable recovery of its own, though Chansey does tend to be very passive. The increased presence of Mega Heracross, Mega Medicham, and Mega Gardevoir after the Aegislash ban has crippled stall's viability, and as a result Chansey is no longer as good as it used to be, but as far as stall is concerned, Chansey is still a solid Pokemon in OU.</p>

<div class="interview-speaker briyella">
<img src="/smog/issue36/interview-briyella.png" alt="bri" />
<h4>Swinub</h4>

<p>Swinub is a very unfortunate case. It's common knowledge that Ice-types have always been defensively poor, and in Little Cup there is no exception. To be honest, Ice-type coverage isn't that great in the tier either. You know Ice is a bad offensive type in LC when the most viable user of STAB Ice-type moves is Protean Froakie, which isn't even an Ice-type. The only other remotely viable Ice-type in the metagame is Choice Scarf Snover, which lost most of its relevance when XY's auto-weather nerf made sand much less threatening, meaning the latter no longer needs to be checked so closely. If you're reading this and wondering why Swinub isn't being talked about here, it's because that's about how relevant it is. Ice-types in general are that horrible here.</p>

<p>A unique immunity to both Sandstorm and Hail granted by its typing hardly helps when both weathers have become very uncommon in this generation of Little Cup. Access to dual screens is pretty cool for it, but it doesn't have the stats or defensive typing to make reliable use of this tactic. The only meaningful things Swinub can lay claim to are its access to Stealth Rock, neutrality to Rock due to its Ground typing, and Thick Fat to make it also take neutral damage from Fire-type attacks, but none of these attributes are enough to save it from its horrible reality of being a typical Ice-type in Little Cup.</p>
  </div>

<div class="interview-speaker mattl">
<img src="/smog/issue36/interview-mattl.png" alt="mattl" />
<h4>Mamoswine</h4>

<p>When Swinub grows up, however, it can hold its own quite well on the OU battlefield; Mamoswine's always been a solid Pokemon. It's not a dominating force, but it's more of a nuisance as offensive teams tend to struggle to switch into it because Ground and Ice is really good coverage, especially in tandem with Mamoswine's nice base 130 Attack stat. Additionally, it has nice priority in Ice Shard, which helps compensate for Mamoswine's mediocre base 80 Speed at times. Icicle Spear, while a bit unreliable, is an option that allows Mamoswine to check lead Focus Sash Breloom.</p>

<p>Although Mamoswine is often a Life Orb attacker, it can be used as a Focus Sash lead itself, as it has access to Stealth Rock and Endeavor, which allows it to wallbreak under the right conditions. XY gave Mamoswine Freeze Dry, which, although fairly gimmicky, allows it to 2HKO Rotom-W, one of Mamoswine's would-be counters. Stone Edge and Superpower are also alternatives which can be used depending on what its team needs. Overall, Mamoswine's good power, coverage, and priority make it useful versus offense, and although it isn't a centralizing Pokemon, it's definitely worth considering for a teamslot.</p>
