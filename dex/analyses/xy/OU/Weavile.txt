Overview
########
Weavile is, for the most part, a forgotten offensive threat. However, it actually functions very well in the Overused metagame due to its high Attack stat and immense base 125 Speed, the latter of which allows it to outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame. In addition, its typing gives it great dual STAB coverage. Weavile also has great utility, as it can revenge kill a multitude of threats with its high Speed and Ice Shard as well as cripple defensive Pokemon with Knock Off. While Weavile has great offensive potential, it also has virtually nonexistent bulk, taking even neutral hits badly. Its typing gives it an unfortunate weakness to Stealth Rock, a 4x weakness to the common Fighting-type moves, and weaknesses to two common priority moves: Bullet Punch and Mach Punch. Nevertheless, Weavile can provide great support as a revenge killer and a Knock Off user, so it is definitely a threat to look out for in Overused.

Moves
========
Weavile has everything it needs to perform its role effectively. Knock Off is a powerful STAB move that Weavile utilizes to great success; it can do hefty damage to most threats while also removing their items. Ice Shard allows Weavile to revenge kill many threats, such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Noivern, as well as faster threats such as Choice Scarf Salamence and Venusaur in sun. As a secondary STAB move, Ice Punch is used to take out Gliscor, Hippowdon, Togekiss, and Mandibuzz. Low Kick rounds off Weavile's coverage as its best option against Heatran, Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Terrakion; it also deals reasonably well with other Steel-types. Pursuit is an excellent alternative option as it allows Weavile to weaken or eliminate many Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Gengar, Latios, Celebi, and Starmie.

Set Details
========
Life Orb is the standard item for a frail sweeper, combining power with the ability to switch moves. The EVs give Weavile the most power it can have, and the Jolly nature allows Weavile to outspeed Timid Starmie, Timid Latios, and Timid Gengar. Enough Speed is invested to outrun Greninja, which is the fastest relevant threat that Weavile can outrun in OU. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense so that Weavile can take priority attacks a bit better.

Usage Tips
========
Weavile primarily plays as a hit-and-run attacker, as it has high offensive stats but often can't stay in for long because of its frailty. In general, Weavile's main role is revenge kill threats to the whole team, which it does effectively. Switch it in on a Pokemon that bothers your team but is weak to one of Weavile's moves, such as Latios, and simply use the appropriate move, which is Knock Off in this case. There is no need to worry about mispredicting with Knock Off because any Pokemon that the opponent switches in will have its item removed. Between its high Speed and access to Ice Shard, Weavile is excellent at checking threats holding a Choice Scarf as well; it is especially good at checking Pokemon 4x weak to Ice, such as Salamence, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Weavile's main STAB move is often powerful enough to revenge weakened neutral threats, but you can also try and predict the switch-in by using a move more suited to taking down that Pokemon instead. When a Pokemon that threatens Weavile comes in, simply switch out and come in again later when needed.

Team Options
========
Because of Weavile's ability to easily eliminate Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, good teammates are Pokemon that can benefit from having Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon gone. Terrakion, Thundurus-T, and Starmie all appreciate these Pokemon removed. It is almost mandatory to have Rapid Spin support to manage Weavile's Stealth Rock weakness, so Tentacruel and Starmie are good partners. Tentacruel in particular has great defensive synergy with Weavile, as Tentacruel can take the Fighting- and Fire-type attacks aimed at Weavile and Weavile can eliminate the Ground- and Grass-type Pokemon that give Tentacruel trouble. Anything that appreciates Knock Off and Ice Shard support makes a good partner; Keldeo appreciates Weavile's ability to remove Celebi, Jellicent, and Latios, and Keldeo can also eliminate some of Weavile's counters, such as Skarmory and Forretress. A lot of the aforementioned Pokemon also really love Pursuit support, if Weavile happens to be using the move.

Other Options
########
Weavile can run a Swords Dance set to boost its Attack to great levels, setting up when it forces something out, but this strategy is very risky due to Weavile's frailty and it relies heavily on prediction. Choice Band can enable Weavile to hit with more power, especially with Pursuit if the opponent tries to stay in, but it makes Weavile very easy to play around. Weavile can learn Icicle Crash, which is more powerful than Ice Punch, but it is illegal with Low Kick, which is an essential move. Finally, Weavile can run a gimmicky Focus Sash + Fake Out + Counter set, but dedicated leads are uncommon and this set doesn't really take advantage of Weavile's defining qualities, so it is generally inferior.

Checks & Counters
########
**Mach Punch**: Mach Punch users that don't take much from Ice Shard can easily KO Weavile due to its 4x weakness to Fighting. This includes Conkeldurr and Infernape; Infernape in particular resists Ice Shard. A healthy Breloom can check Weavile with Mach Punch, but as it takes around 80% damage from Ice Shard, it is a shaky check at best.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf users that can outspeed and KO Weavile while also taking little damage from Ice Shard, such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Magneton are very effective checks.

**Offensive Threats**: Pokemon that can take all of Weavile's moves and KO back or use it as setup bait are good counters. This includes Infernape and Conkeldurr due to Mach Punch and Fighting STAB, Azumarill due to Play Rough, and Gyarados, which can set up Substitute and Dragon Dances against Weavile.

**Defensive Threats**: Many bulky Steel-types, such as Skarmory and Forretress, can wall Weavile. In addition to that, many Pokemon with reasonable bulk can capitalize on Weavile's relatively low-powered moves. Examples include Chansey, Keldeo, Vaporeon, and Rotom-W. Tangrowth and Hippowdon can check variants without the very uncommon Icicle Crash. Politoed, Tentacruel, and Avalugg also shrug off Weavile's moves; the first two can KO Weavile with rain-boosted attacks, while the third can retaliate with Gyro Ball or simply Recover off the damage. There are many defensive threats that Weavile just cannot break through.

**Stealth Rock**: As Weavile is weak to Stealth Rock and also takes Life Orb damage, it can be worn down very quickly. Anything that can set up Stealth Rock can seriously damage Weavile's ability to do its job effectively. This includes Forretress, Excadrill, and Terrakion.
