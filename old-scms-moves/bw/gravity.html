<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When Gravity is activated, numerous effects occur for the move's duration. All Pokemon on the field are affected by these effects, even in doubles and triples. All immunities to Ground-type moves, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Arena Trap are removed. Pokemon who previously had a Flying-type take neutral damage from Ground-type attacks, but Pokemon with Levitate act as though they have no ability. The moves Magnet Rise and Telekinesis are also negated. It also prevents the moves Bounce, Fly, Jump Kick, Hi Jump Kick, Sky Drop, and Splash from being used, and immediately cancels Bounce and Fly if they are in the middle of an attack. It also negates the effect of Air Balloon. Fails if this move is already in effect. It also changes the effective evasion of all Pokemon in play, multiplying all evasion stats by 3/5, or a two-stage decrease.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Gravity is a pretty interesting move that brings lots of different effects for players to abuse. Making a team around Gravity is a legitimate strategy that focuses on either abusing the high powered moves that were once inaccurate or making full use of entry hazards which now damage every single type of Pokemon bar Magic Guard users. Unlike teams centered around Trick Room, Gravity-based teams have the benefit of not changing Pokemon too much; most abusers have the same EV spread and moveslots. This field effect just makes their attacks much more reliable to use. Thus, it is more likely that those Pokemon still function well even if Gravity is not in effect.</p>

<p>Since Gravity nullifies Ground immunities, most Pokemon that abuse said moves or gain STAB on it become even more threatening. Take Excadrill as an example; in normal conditions, Pokemon such as Skarmory and Bronzong would be relatively safe to switch in thanks to their immunities. However, in Gravity, both will lose to a now-super effective Earthquake. While Gravity is in effect, Dugtrio can hypothetically trap every Pokemon in the game and also KO with Earthquake if they are weakened enough. Moves that were once inaccurate can also be used as if they had perfect accuracy; a Starmie with Hydro Pump, Blizzard, and Thunder is a common sight on Gravity teams.</p>

<p>This strategy is not without its weaknesses; for starters, unlike Light Screen or Reflect, nothing prolongs this field effect. After using Gravity, there are only four turns to abuse it; this situation becomes even worse if you need to switch to another Pokemon, meaning it only gets three turns to make full use of the added effects. Finally, as it is a field effect, your opponents can also benefit from the raised accuracy.</p>
