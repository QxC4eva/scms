[Overview]

<p>Blissey has been the premier special wall since her release in GSC. It's not difficult to see why: Blissey has an absurd amount of Special Defense, the highest HP stat in the game, and an incredible support movepool. But it's not all good news for Blissey; her Defense stat is pitiful, and her offensive stats are mediocre to say the least. To make matters worse, Eviolite makes Blissey's pre-evolution, Chansey, much bulkier than she is. However, Blissey does have some advantages over Chansey, namely a usable Special Attack stat and the ability to choose between Shed Shell and Leftovers. Unfortunately, Blissey is setup bait for many competent DW threats, such as Excadrill, Keldeo, and Chandelure. Don't let these faults deter you from using Blissey, though, as she can wall many of the threats in the DW metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Blissey makes for an excellent Wish user due to her high HP stat and excellent bulk. Wish is mandatory for healing Blissey and her teammates. Protect is useful to guarantee Wish recovery and scout for Trick, Knock Off, and Fighting-type STAB moves, all of which greatly threaten Blissey. However, Blissey can use Softboiled instead to increase her walling capabilities. Toxic is Blissey's main method of dealing damage to foes, as her offensive stats are mediocre. Seismic Toss is useful to deal consistent damage to all Pokemon bar Ghost-types, while Flamethrower lets Blissey take down Steel-, Grass-, and Bug-types, such as Ferrothorn, Breloom, and Genesect.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Shed Shell is the item of choice, as it prevents Blissey from being setup bait for Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure. If your team deals with Chandelure quite easily, then feel free to run Leftovers. The EV spread maximizes HP to make Blissey's Wishes more effective. Maximum Defense investment enables Blissey to take all but STAB Fighting-type physical moves. An EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD can be used if you're not concerned with passing enormous Wishes to your teammates; one of the benefits of this EV spread is the ability to avoid 2HKOs from Modest Choice Specs Politoed's Hydro Pump and Heatran's Flash Fire-boosted Fire Blast in the sun.</p>

<p>Any sturdy physical wall, such as Slowbro, Gliscor, Amoonguss, or Skarmory, makes for a decent partner to Blissey. Skarmory gets a special mention because of its ability to set up Spikes for Blissey, who in turn can force many switches with her excellent bulk. Similarly, other entry hazard setters, including Ferrothorn and Forretress, also pair well with Blissey.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Blissey makes for an excellent support Pokemon with her excellent HP, Special Defense, and movepool. Aromatherapy is useful for removing poison from members of more defensive teams and removing paralysis from those of more offensive ones. Softboiled gives Blissey a reliable recovery move and allows her to survive hits throughout the battle. Toxic is Blissey's main means of dealing damage to foes, as her offensive stats aren't great. Seismic Toss lets Blissey deal consistent and reliable damage to everything excluding Ghost-types. Flamethrower can be used to hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, which might try to set up hazards, or Excadrill, which might attempt to set up a Swords Dance or two.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Shed Shell enables Blissey to escape the wrath of Chandelure, a Pokemon that can switch into her with impunity and freely set up with Substitute and Calm Mind. If your team is able to lure in and defeat Chandelure with ease, feel free to use Leftovers. The EV spread maximizes HP and Defense because Blissey can easily take special attacks even without investment. An EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD with a Bold nature is a viable alternative if you don't want to invest in Blissey's enormous base HP stat; this spread also lets Blissey avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Politoed's Hydro Pump in the rain and from a Flash Fire-boosted Fire Blast from Heatran in the sun. If your team needs a Stealth Rock user, Blissey can run the move in the third moveslot.</p>

<p>Teammates that can take on Fighting-types make for good partners; notable examples include Gliscor, Slowbro, and Jellicent. Slowbro and Jellicent can also check Keldeo, one of the few special attackers that can defeat Blissey without resorting to Trick. Entry hazard users, such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Tentacruel, are also good teammates to Blissey, who forces many switches. In particular, Tentacruel is a fantastic teammate, as the Toxic Spikes it provides can let Blissey stall out opponents. Additionally, Tentacruel checks Keldeo and can take on Fighting-types with its Poison typing and decent bulk.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Counter set can surprise and OHKO physical attackers. Thunder Wave can replace Toxic if you want to cripple fast sweepers that switch into Blissey such as Lucario. Blissey has access to Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, but they are generally outclassed by Flamethrower because of its ability to hit the common Steel-types in DW. If using Blissey on a rain team, Thunder is a good offensive option, though. A Calm Mind set can allow Blissey to make better use of Serene Grace but would leave her outclassed by nearly every other Calm Mind user. Blissey can use Psych Up to laugh at Substitute + Calm Mind users such as Jirachi, which generally can set up all over her.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything with a Fighting-type STAB move, such as Breloom, Conkeldurr, or Terrakion, will hit Blissey so hard that an RBY Chansey in the Safari Zone will whimper. Swords Dance Scizor and Excadrill can set up on Blissey, as they only fear the uncommon Flamethrower. Toxic Spikes are an excellent indirect check to Blissey, as they limit her ability to stay on the battlefield for a long period of time; these can be easily set up by Roserade and Tentacruel. Trick users, such as Latios, can cripple Blissey, as she is incredibly reliant on Shed Shell to avoid the wrath of Chandelure or Leftovers to give her consistent recovery. In DW, Keldeo stands out as one of the only special attackers that can beat Blissey, as Secret Sword targets Blissey's pitiful Defense stat. Other special attackers that can overcome Blissey's defenses include Reuniclus, Growth Venusaur in the sun, and Wish + Calm Mind Jirachi. Finally, Forretress and Ferrothorn can set up hazards all over Blissey, as they only fear the rare Flamethrower.</p>
