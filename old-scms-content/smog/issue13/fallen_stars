<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>They were great not too long ago, but as Generation 5 rolled  along, they were left in the dust. Each of the featured Pokemon enjoyed  high usage in the Generation 4 metagame, as they were top notch, but now  their moment in the sun has passed. In this article we will analyze the  cross-generational changes that took place, and ultimately sealed these  Pokemon's fate.</p>

<h2>Those Fallen Stars</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/499.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Rotom-A</strong></p>

<p>This guy used to be awesome. I could use him as a RestTalker, a Choice user,        or a SubCharge user,  to name a few options. But B/W changed everything. Rotom-A's handy  Ghost typing is gone, so he can no longer serve as a spinblocker.  Additionally, with most of the formes already outclassed, the better  Rotom formes acquired bad typings. An  exception to this may be Rotom-W, but this guy is little more than a  stronger Lanturn, and with so many other options available, he is just  not that useful. Typing is extremely important in Pokemon, and it goes  to show that Rotom-A's Ghost typing was the true source of his  greatness. Oh well, c'est la vie!</p>

<strong>Infernape</strong></p>

<p>I was particularly upset when I realized that one of the  strongest wallbreakers was no longer useful. While there are many  factors that contributed to the fire monkey's decline, the emergence of  Blaziken and the proliferation of speedy Water-types played a major  role. Blaziken, who was previously outclassed by Infernape, acquired a  nifty new ability with the advent of B/W. With Speed Boost, Blaziken is  able to automatically increase his Speed, and, with better attacking  stats, he makes Infernape look obsolete. Thanks to the likes of Kerudio  (the most prominent new Water-type), Infernape's unorthodox Speed tier  is further populated by a foe who can easily OHKO it. With Kerudio  likely to be extremely common, Infernape is going to have a tough time  pulling off sweeps.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/143.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Snorlax</strong></p>

<p>Back in the day, he was phat. Now, he can't keep up with the  times. Curse Snorlax, Belly Drum Snorlax, and Choice Band Snorlax just  don't pack the same punch. The new metagame is full of plenty of faster  physical Fighting-types, who love to come in and set up on this guy.  Roobushin, Meloetta, and their friends have come into the equation, and  Snorlax is nonviable as a result. The big guy likes slower games so he  can setup, as his Speed is abysmal. With B/W even faster-paced than DPP,  it looks like the end for Snorlax. Maybe he'll be a good UU.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/330.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Flygon</strong></p>

<p>He was already a late-bloomer in DPP. With Garchomp, Latias,  and Salamence banished to Ubers, he finally enjoyed top-tier viability.  Now, not only are these stronger dragons unbanned, but the 5th  Generation has introduced many more vicious Dragon-types into the  metagame. Say hello to Sazandora, Crimgan, and Kyurem. Flygon isn't  unaccustomed to being overshadowed. His best bet to return to prominence  is a mass banning of all the mentioned dragons. Until then, so  long.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><img src="/media/smog/13/fallenstars_swampert.png" alt="" /></div>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/260.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Swampert</strong></p>

<p>Reliable no longer, Swampert is old news. B/W brought many new  Pokemon who can set up against him, along with a plethora of viable  Grass-types. A particularly troublesome foe is Nattorei, who can setup on, or OHKO, Swampert.  Shandera is also a major threat, as with proper timing he can switch in  and OHKO Swampert via Energy Ball, and Swampert is a sitting duck  thanks to Shadow Tag. While Swampert can remedy this by running Shed  Shell as his item of choice, the lack of Leftovers recovery  significantly decreases his longevity. He can still be used, but there  are better options.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So there you have it. Anyone thinking that the DPP success of  these guys gave them an automatic ticket to B/W success is dead wrong.  With a brand new metagame, everything is different, and people are  finding out through empirical testing that the same old reliable  standbys will no longer cut it. With a new generation waiting to be  defined, only time will tell who the new leading OU Pokemon are.  Unfortunately, the Pokemon in this article will be classified as being  left behind.</p>
