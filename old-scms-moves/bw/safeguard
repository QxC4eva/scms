[SHORT DESC]
Protects the user's team from status conditions for 5 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prevents status conditions including confusion from being inflicted on all Pokemon in the user's party by the opponent for five turns. It also protects from Toxic Spikes. It does not prevent self-inflicted status such as that from Toxic Orb, or the confusion side-effect of Outrage. Does not prevent the effect of Yawn if Yawn was used prior to Safeguard. The effect is canceled by Defog. The move fails if the effect is already active.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Safeguard has a very interesting effect in protecting the team from status, but there are so few usable Pokemon with access to Safeguard that can afford the moveslot it takes up to use it when there are more important moves that can be used instead. Not to mention the fact that protecting the team for only 5 turns is much harder to do than to heal an already statused team with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy. However, there is one Pokemon, Wobbuffet, that has both a small enough movepool and enough bulk to set up and abuse Safeguard successfully. Even then, Wobbuffet rarely has time to use it, though it can be used to protect a stat boosting teammate from status as they switch in on a recent KO by Wobbuffet.</p>
