<h2>Description</h2> 
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance of poisoning the target.</p> 

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In spite of its horrible coverage and the fact that almost no non-Poison-type Pokemon uses it, Poison Jab is generally a strong and useful STAB move for physical Poison-type Pokemon. Mono-Poison-type Pokemon such as Muk, Arbok, and Seviper all have to resort to using this move for their STAB move. Other Poison-type Pokemon are also able to use this move, though they will generally only do so because of a lacking movepool. Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Skuntank, and in extremely rare cases Toxicroak and Drapion are examples here. Poison Jab is a good STAB move to have overall, but never consider it for any Pokemon that isn't a Poison-type.</p>
