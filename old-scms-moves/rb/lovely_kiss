<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Puts the target to sleep.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Lovely Kiss is one of the best sleep inducing moves in the game. It's reliable in accuracy and its user, Jynx, is pretty fast and deals with sleep lead Exeggutor. Hypnosis will fail almost half of the time, so Lovely Kiss might win the sleep battle against a Gengar. Jynx should never be seen without this move.</p>
