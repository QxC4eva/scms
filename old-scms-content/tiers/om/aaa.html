<h2>What is Almost Any Ability?</h2>

<p>The idea behind <a href="/forums/threads/.3528058">Almost Any Ability</a> is quite simple; Pok&eacute;mon gain access to <em>almost</em> any ability! The banlist will be posted below. These abilities are accessibile to any Pok&eacute;mon and are used instead of their already exsisting ability. This create many great tools for offense and defense; for example, offense has access to abilities like Adaptability and Tinted Lens, while defense has access to abilities like Regenerator and Magic Guard. This metagame is an exciting one and is able to be played on the main Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! server as a permanent ladder.</p>
