<p>The CAP project receives amazing submissions from some of the most talented artists in the Smogon community. Unfortunately, only one art design and one sprite can win in a given project. This gallery showcases some of the best art and sprite submissions from past CAP projects, and features some of the most prolific and successful artists in CAP history.<p>
