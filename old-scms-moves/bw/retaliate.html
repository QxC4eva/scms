[SHORT DESC]
Power doubles if the user's teammate fainted the previous turn.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. If a Pokemon in the user's party fainted on the turn prior to using this move, its Base Power doubles.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Retaliate is marginally useful on Normal-type revenge killers such as Ambipom, Cinccino, and Stoutland. However, even though it can reach a sky-high Base Power of 140, the fact that an ally has to have fainted in the previous turn makes it a rather inconsistent move. It is better to use more reliable Normal-type moves such as Return and Double-Edge instead.</p>
