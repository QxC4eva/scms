[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>OHKOes the target. Will not have any effect if the target is a Ghost-type. Ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers. Will fail on opponents of a higher level. This attack's accuracy is equal to (user's level - target's level + 30)%. Pokemon with the ability Sturdy are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While Horn Drill has massive potential, especially when paired with Mind Reader or the No Guard ability, use of the move is frowned upon in a competitive setting. Furthermore, it is banned under the OHKO Clause, which is in effect on the Smogon server.</p>
