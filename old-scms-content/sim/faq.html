<!--<p><strong>Q: It says "Ladder (probably) updated, but score could not be retrieved (error: socket hangup / corruption)"! Did Pok&eacute;mon Showdown just cheat me of my points?</strong></p>
<p>A: The ladder might be unresponsive because of lag and your ranking might not change immediately after a battle. However, the ladder will most likely update after a while, so rest assured you did not play through that battle for nothing.</p>-->

<p><strong>Q: What is Smogon?</strong></p>
<p>A: Smogon is the most popular online Pok&eacute;mon competitive battling community. PS is just one part of Smogon, being the official Pok&eacute;mon Simulator for the community.</p>

<p>A: Type <span style="color:#F00;"><strong>/help</strong></span> or <span style="color:#F00;"><strong>/?</strong></span> to see a list of commands sorted by category. You may type those commands directly in the chat to use them.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How do I register my username?</strong></p>

<p>A: Type <strong><span style="color:#F00;">/avatar</span></strong> to see the list of avatars you can choose from. Type <strong><span style="color:#F00;">/avatar #</span></strong>, where # is the number of the avatar you want to have (the space between avatar and # is important).</p>

<p><a name="customavatar"><strong>Q: How can I get a custom avatar?</strong></p>
<p>A: Only global staff members (% and above) are permitted custom avatars. Custom avatars have to be manually implemented so it just isn't practical to add them for every user that asks. While there are exceptions to this rule, you aren't one of them.</p>

<!--<p><strong>Q: Where can I suggest a room?</strong></p>
<p>A: Follow the direction in the <a href="/forums/threads/3491714/">Room Suggestions thread<a/> and you can post in the subforum with your idea. Only Showdown staff can read your suggestions, so don't be intimidated by it being empty!</p>-->

<p>A: Type <span style="color:#F00;"><strong>/tour</strong></span> to see a list of the current tournaments hosted in the server and in which rooms they are.

<p><a name="abuse"><strong>Q: A mod is abusing their powers. What can I do?</strong></p>
<p>A: If a room Moderator or Driver is abusing their powers, bring relevant logs and screenshots to a room owner (#). If a room owner is unavailable and the case is urgent, PM a Moderator (@) in the lobby. If you believe a global staff member is abusing their power, PM all relevant information to a Leader (&) or Administrator (~).</p>

<p><strong>Q: I was punished unfairly. What can I do?</strong></p>
<p>A: Your first point of contact should be the staff member that punished you. In the event that you do not know who punished you, try asking a staff member to check and refer you to the appropriate party. If the staff member who punished you is unwilling to remove the punishment, contact a Room Owner (#). If the punishment was in the Lobby or was a global punishment and the staff is reluctant to remove the punishment, PM a Leader (&) or Administrator (~).</p>

<p><a name="doubles"><strong>Q: Does Pok&eacute;mon Showdown support Double / Triple / Rotation battles?</strong></a></p>
<p>A: Pok&eacute;mon Showdown currently supports double and triple battles. You may challenge a foe or friend to several double battles formats: VGC 2014, <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3476469">Smogon Doubles</a>, Random Battle, Custom Game, or Challenge Cup. Furthermore, VGC 2014 is ladderable, as is Smogon Doubles. Pok&eacute;mon Showdown still does not support Rotation battles, but there are plans to implement them at a later date, as well as Wonder Launcher battles.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How do I make a team?</strong></p>
<p>A: Click on Teambuilder on the left side of the screen, and it will walk you through the steps to make your team.</p>

<p>A: First, export the teams from PO. Copy the text of your team and then click the Import/Export button on the Pok&eacute;mon Showdown  Teambuilder. Paste the text in there and click Save.</p>

<p><strong>Q: My teams keep getting deleted. What is going on?</strong></p>

You may either change the setting on your browser or go to Backup/Restore in the Teambuilder and copy your teams to save them in a text file for easy importing later if you are afraid of losing them. If you are using the downloaded client you can simply save your teams in a folder.</p>

<!--<p><strong>Q: How do I delete a Pokemon in the Teambuilder?</strong></p>
<p>A: Usually, what you want to do is replace it with another Pokemon. To do this, simply change its species. If you really need to delete a Pokemon, click Import/Export and delete the text for the Pokemon you want to remove.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How do I change the order of my team?</strong></p>
<p>A: Once a team has been made you can click Import/Export and copy / paste the Pokemon and its moveset to a different position.</p>-->

<p><strong>Q: How do I use the team I just made in a battle?</strong></p>
<p>A: Above the 'Look for a Battle' button there will be two other options to choose from. The top button will allow you to select a tier to play in while the button below that will allow you to select a team for that tier.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How do I save a log of the battle to watch later?</strong></p>
<p>A: After you have finished a battle, click the Share Replay button. In a few seconds, a window will pop up with a link to your battle saved on the Pok&eacute;mon Showdown Replay Viewer. This link can be shared and will show a full replay of your battle including animations. If you were not in the battle, you can type <strong><span style="color:#F00;">/savereplay</span></strong> at any point to save the replay.

<p><a name="timerstall"><strong>Q: My opponent is timerstalling. Can anyone help?</strong></a></p>
<p>A: Timerstalling is abusing the battle timer system by consistently waiting a long time before making a move. If your opponent is timerstalling, you should PM a Moderator (@) in the lobby.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Someone is abusing me through PM. What can I do about it?</strong></p>
<p>A: If it is not too serious, use the <strong>/ignore username</strong> function which will not show any messages from that user. In the event that this escalates, you can PM a global staff member with appropriate screenshots and logs.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What do symbols next to a person's name mean?</strong></p>
<p>A: Type <strong><span style="color:#F00;">/groups</span></strong> to see this list at any time. See the <a href="/sim/staff_faq">staff faq</a> for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>+ Voice - They can use ! commands such as !groups, and talk during moderated chat</li>
<li>% Driver - The above, and they can also mute users and check for alts</li>
<li>@ Moderator - The above, and they can ban users</li>
<li>&amp; Leader - The above, and they can promote moderators and force ties</li>
<li>~ Administrator - They can do anything</li>
<li># Room Owner - They are the owner of the room
<li>&#8253; Locked - This user cannot talk in rooms or in PM</li>
<li>! Muted - This player cannot speak in this room</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="star"><strong>Q: What does this star (&starf;) in front of my username mean?</strong></a></p>
<p>A: This rank denotes the players in a battle. It allows them to use ! informational commands and set modchat up to +. This rank does not exist under normal circumstances outside battles.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is a good rating?</strong></p>
<p>A: What is and isn't a good rating generally depends on the tier and how active it is. Check the top 100 players on the ladder to get a better idea.</p>

<!--<p><strong>Q: What does provisional mean and why aren't I in the top 100?</strong></p><p>A: Provisional means that the deviation of your ranking is greater than 100. To remove your provisional status, simply play more battles until your deviation falls below 100. Having a provisional ranking will always place you below players whose rank is not provisional, and is likely why you are not shown in the top 100.</p>-->

<p><strong>Q: What is this move called Magikarp's Revenge?</strong></p>
<p>A: Magikarp's Revenge was designed for testing multiple effects on the same move. It is not a real move and is not allowed in standard battles, although you can use it in Debug Mode.</p>

<p><a name="elo"><strong>Q: Why did this user gain / lose so many points at once?</strong></a></p>
<p>A: The amount of points you win or lose is determined by the difference between the two players' Elo ratings. The player with the higher rating has a higher expected chance to win and will gain less or lose more in case of a win or loss respectively. The player with less points would inversely gain more and lose less.</p>

<!--<p><a name="randomcap"><strong>Q: What is this fakemon that appeared in Random Battle and why is it here?</strong></a></p>
<p>A: Random Battles feature the CAP Pokemon that are created by the Smogon community. Once again, type <strong><span style="color:#F00;">/cap</span></strong> for an introduction to the Create-A-Pokemon project.</p>-->

<p><a name="restarts"><strong>Q: Why is the server shutting down?</strong></a></p>
<p>A: In order to implement new features, to solve bugs or to get rid of lag, the server needs to restart time to time. Don't worry, the server restarts once most battles have ended and new battles are prevented from starting. The restart itself lasts for just 0.4 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I host a tournament? Is there a tournament system on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown?</strong></p>
<p>A: There is a tournament system, depending on the setting room owners and room moderators or only room owners can start tournaments using it. You can also host tournaments in the Tournaments chat room by using an external bracket generator such as Challonge.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are leagues allowed on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown?</strong></p>
<p>A: Pok&eacute;mon Showdown does not officially support leagues.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is Modchat?</strong></p>
<p>A: Modchat is when a moderator+ restricts the chatroom to a certain rank of user. There are different types of modchat and they are:<br>
Autoconfirmed: A user is autoconfirmed when they have won at least one rated battle and have been registered for a week or longer.<br>
+: Only those with + and above may talk.<br>
%: Only those with % and above may talk.<br>
@: Only those with @ and above may talk.<br>
&: Only those with & and above may talk.<br>
~: Only those with ~ and above may talk.<br>
The players of a battle may also set modchat up to level + in their own battle room.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What does a lock do?</strong></p>
<p>A: A lock prevents a user from talking in chats of any kind and lasts until the server is reset or a staff member removes it.</p>

<p>Please try not to ask any of these questions in the main chat.</p>
