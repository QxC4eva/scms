<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises the power of physical attacks 10%. Muscle Band boosts the power of Struggle.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Muscle Band is a lesser seen item that sees occasional use on physical sweepers. Though Life Orb is oftentimes used instead of Muscle Band, it does have one characteristic that helps it avoid being totally outclassed: no recoil. This fact enables you to bluff a Choice item in battle, since many players see no recovery and no recoil as a sure sign of such items. Unfortunately, Muscle Band does nothing to aid special attacks, meaning mixed sweepers are better off using Life Orb and enduring the 10% recoil. Special sweepers can hold Muscle Band's special counterpart, <a href="/dp/items/wise_glasses">Wise Glasses</a>, for the same effect.</p>
