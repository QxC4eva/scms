Overview
########
XY retyping was extremely beneficial for Azumarill. Fairy / Water gives it a slew of useful resistances and the ability to hit with great coverage that few Pokemon resist. Because of this, Azumarill really only has three main counters- Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, the latter two which it can hit hard with coverage
Coupled with the power boost it gets from its ability and its solid attacking options, Azumarill is a fairly bulky Water-type pivot that is also capable of dealing serious damage.
Unfortunately, despite Aqua Jet, its poor Speed stat still holds it back somewhat, ensuring that in an offensive environment, it almost always moves last. 
This makes it fairly easy to check, as there are quite a few Pokemon that can outspeed Azumarill, sponge an Aqua Jet, and deal serious damage back.
Azumarill is also susceptible to Intimidate and burn status, both of which severely reduce its attacking capabilities.
Attacker
########
name: Attacker
move 1: Play Rough
move 2: Waterfall / Belly Drum
move 3: Aqua Jet
move 4: Protect
ability: Huge Power
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 164 HP / 252 Atk / 92 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Play Rough is the main STAB attack here. Good base 90 BP (135 after STAB) coming off of Azumarill's immense attack easily puts short work to many unprepared teams. The chance of lowering its opponent's attack stat can also be very useful at times.
Waterfall is secondary Water-type STAB that has almost perfect coverage with Play Rough. It also has better accuracy with almost as much power, and is generally a more reliable attack move.
Belly Drum can also be used in this slot, giving Azumarill a high risk, high reward setup move that will quickly enable it to deal even more damage than before. With adequate team support, Azumarill can use this move to boost its Attack to insane levels and easily OHKO many opponents.
Aqua Jet rounds off Azumarill's offensive arsenal by helping take down weakened foes. This is extremely useful to help make up for Azumarill's middling Speed stat and help it serve as a great revenge killer. 
Finally, Protect is the last move to let Azumarill protect itself from an opposing attack, buying both itself and its partner time to execute its own attacks. It also guards Azumarill against its partner's spread moves, and stalls on opposing field effects.

Set Details
========
Maximum Attack investment is used to make Azumarill as powerful as possible. 
Enough speed to outpace 0 Spe Tyranitar and below gives Azumarill to tackle most bulkier tanks without having to sacrifice too must investment in speed.
The rest of the EVs are stashed into HP for rounded bulk.
The Sitrus Berry is used to give Azumarill a bit more longevity, healing 25% of its HP once it's whittled down to below 50%, helping it recover from Belly Drums. Azumarill's natural bulk allows it to survive most neutral attacks, and the Sitrus Berry can often turn 2HKOs into 3HKOs by boosting Azumarill's total usable HP.
Lum Berry can also be used to help Azumarill heal off status.
A spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk could also work if more bulk is preferred over extra Speed.
Usage Tips
========
Due to its below average Speed, Azumarill really requires partner support in order to shine. It needs a good partner to buy it time and bulk while it dishes out its powerful attacks.
Its bulk lets it sponge a few neutral hits while it dishes out attacks.
Generally it should be brought in against Dragon or Fighting-types that it can defeat relatively easily or to revenge kill weakened opponents. 
Due to its typing advantage, it's a good idea to use Azumarill to bait in Intimidate users and KO them by hitting them super effectively with its still-powerful STABs.
It's generally best to play Azumarill as a more hit-and-run attacker (unless you're using Belly Drum) due to its lower Speed yet high attack power. It isn't really as much of a flat out sweeper as it is a revenge killer and pivot.

Team Options
========
Hitmontop is a great partner for Azumarill. Its Fake Out and Intimidate buy Azumarill a lot of time and bulk, increasing its longevity. It also has Wide Guard, which is useful in stopping Discharges. Other Intimidate users such as Scrafty or Landorus-T are good partners as well.
Partners that can target Electric, Poison, and Grass-types are also great partners. Ground-types are notable since their Earthquake can target multiple opponents at once while Azumarill Protects.
Azumarill loves the company of status abusers. It greatly appreciates paralysis support, and also appreciates the free turns it can get from a partner's Spore. 
Rage Powder / Follow Me users are also vital for Azumarill's success should it use Belly Drum. They can redirect attacks and give Azumarill the valuable window to set up safely and then proceed to sweep. Amoongus is a notable user here as it walls Electric-types and can also spread status, but unfortunately it can't do much against Grass-types.
This set could also work well with Trick Room. If so, then a Brave nature with minimum Speed investment should be used.
Dual Screens users are helpful as they increase Azumarill's bulk, making it easier to set up.
Helping Hand users can boost Azumarill's power and help it reach some key KOs and revenge a larger spectrum of Pokemon

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Aqua Jet
move 2: Play Rough
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Ice Punch / Superpower
ability: Huge Power
item: Choice Band
evs: 164 HP / 252 Atk / 92 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
While it may not be Azumarill's main STAB attack of choice, Aqua Jet is arguably one of the most important moves here. As priority, it remedies Azumarill's poorer Speed stat and helps chip off damage from weakened opponents.
Aqua Jet is much more important for this set because it makes up for Azumarill's lack of Speed. It also has decent power, letting it take down even mildly weakened opponents, making it a very reliable revenge killer.
Play Rough and Waterfall are next on the list as Azumarill's main STAB attacks. Both hit with a lot of power and have good coverage as well as useful secondary effects. When boosted with a Choice Band, few Pokemon can sponge multiple attacks from Azumarill unless they resist its coverage.
Play Rough and Waterfall are the other two STABs for this set. Their secondary effects of decreasing attack and flinching, respectively can come in handy.
The last slot is for coverage, which is really only meant for specific threats, Azumarill's STABs do more damage most of the time.
Ice Punch hits Grass-types, most notably Amoonguss, which would otherwise wall this set.
Superpower smacks Steel-types, namely Ferrothorn. It's riskier to use however and should only be used for Ferrothorn.

Set Details
========
Choice Band is used to immediately boost Azumarill's Attack stat, giving it explosive power and the ability to revenge kill a much wider range of opponents.
Max Attack investment makes Azumarill as powerful as possible.
The Speed EVs let it outspeed uninvested base 60 Speed and below, beating key threats such as Tyranitar.
The remaining EVs are put into HP for bulk.
Usage Tips
========
Unlike the Belly Drum set, this sets purpose is to deal as much damage as possible as quickly as possible, dealing powerful hits before needing to set up.
Its powerful Aqua Jet makes it a premier revenge killer, capable of taking down a lot of neutral Pokemon even when they still have adequate amounts of health left.
Due to its destructive nature, it is ok to play a little more recklessly with this set and let it punch major holes in opposing defenses. Be careful, however, as this set is a lot more vulnerable to offensive strategies than the Belly Drum set.
It simply needs to take advantage of opportunities presented to fire off powerful STABs at its opponent.
A hit-and-run playstyle can also be used to great effect.
Partner support is key, as with all Choice Pokemon, to cover for Azumarill once its job is done and to ward off potential counters.
Team Options
========
Just like with the attacking set, the Choice Band set relies heavily on partner support as well.
Because it is susceptible to type advantage after the opponent realize that it's choiced, teammates that can tackle Grass, Steel, and Poison-types are highly recommended.
Fire-types are great partners. Heatran in particular supports Azumarill well with its powerful Heat Wave, blasting away Steel and Grass-types that Azumarill lures in.
Trick Room setters are also great partners for this set, as they help mitigate Azumarill's lower Speed. Heatran again pairs particularly well with Azumarill with this field effect, and together they make a very capable offensive core.
Azumarill can aid Fire-types by warding off Ground, Rock, Dragon, and Fire-types.
Partners that can handle Electric-types are great as well. Ground-types such as Landorus-T help take down Electric and Steel-types, and can use Intimidate to lower the opponent's attack to help make Azumarill last longer.
This set doesn't require setup opportunities like the above set does, but it does appreciate luring partners that buy it opportunities to hit hard.
Pretty much same as above set
Dual Screens users are helpful as they increase Azumarill's bulk, making it easier to switch in and out more.
Helping Hand users can boost Azumarill's power and help it reach some key KOs and revenge a larger spectrum of Pokemon
Keep in mind that, due to this set's lack of Protect, it is susceptible to its partner's spread moves.
Other Options
########
Splash Plate can be used to boost the power of Azumarill's attacks slightly.
Leftovers I guess
Life Orb for more significant power boost
Knock Off is good coverage against Ghost-types, and also removes opposing items 
Double-Edge is also a powerful coverage option, but doesn't really hit anything in particular and comes with a nasty recoil side effect.
Encore to buy opportunities to set up
Aqua Tail for more Water-type power at the cost of accuracy and flinch.
Bulky Screens set with AJet revenging? idk

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn all resist Azumarill's STABs and can cripple it with status or take it down with their Grass-type attacks. Venusaur gets a special mention as it also is just neutral to Azumarill's coverage moves. Pokemon with Grass-type coverage moves can check Azumarill as well. Mega Charizard Y can weaken its Water-type attacks with Drought and KO it with Solarbeam.
**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Suicune or Jellicent can wall Azumarill as well and burn it with Scald. Rotom-W gets a special mention as it can KO Azumarill with its Electric-type attacks or simply burn it with Will-o-Wisp.
**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon that can take an Aqua Jet and deal damage back are good checks. Thundurus-T is a great example; it can deal a lot of damage with its powerful super effective Thunderbolt. Shaymin-S is a good counter as well, easily sponging an Aqua Jet and OHKOing with Seed Flare. Generally, things with adequate amounts of bulk, no weakness to Water, and powerful, moderately fast attacks fall into this category.
**Status**: Azumarill is absolute shut down by almost all forms of status. Burns cripple it beyond repair, while paralysis severely hinders its usefulness, especially in times where its Aqua Jet is crucial. Toxic isn't as annoying but due to the prevalence of Protect stalling and Azumarill's lack of recovery, it can quickly get worn down.
**Intimidate**: Although Azumarill can hit most Intimidate users hard, their ability to lower Azumarill's attack can be very annoying if said Intimidater is played very actively. Things like Hitmontop or Landorus can pivot in and out and gradually lower Azumarill's attack stat until it is no longer threatening at all. Mawile also has the advantage of being able to hit it fairy hard with Iron Head. However, many Intimidate users such as Landorus or Scrafty have to be careful switching in because they are weak to Azumarill's STAB moves.
**Indirect Damage**: Azumarill isn't particularly powerful but lacks recovery, making it relatively easy to wear down. It is susceptible to all kinds of weather, and takes noticeable damage from Iron Barbs and Rough Skin Pokemon. The fact that it already has to sponge a few hits due to its low Speed severely cuts down on its longevity.
