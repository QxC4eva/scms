[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While sandstorm is the prevailing weather condition, the Base Power of Ground-, Rock-, and Steel-type moves is multiplied by 5325/4096 (about 130%). In addition, if a non-Ground-, Rock-, or Steel-type Pokemon has this ability, it will not take damage from sandstorm.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>All of the Pokemon that obtain this ability already are immune to sandstorm damage (bar <a href="/bw/pokemon/shellos">Shellos</a>). <a href="/bw/pokemon/gigalith">Gigalith</a> is the only Pokemon that doesn't obtain another very good alternative ability; <a href="/bw/pokemon/excadrill">Excadrill</a> has <a href="/bw/abilities/sand_rush">Sand Rush</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/probopass">Probopass</a> has <a href="/bw/abilities/magnet_pull">Magnet Pull</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/hippowdon">Hippowdon</a> has <a href="/bw/abilities/sand_stream">Sand Stream</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/gastrodon">Gastrodon</a> has <a href="/bw/abilities/storm_drain">Storm Drain</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/dugtrio">Dugtrio</a> has <a href="/bw/abilities/arena_trap">Arena Trap</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/landorus">Landorus</a> has <a href="/bw/abilities/sheer_force">Sheer Force</a> from the Dream World. Landorus is the only really common user of the move to power up its STAB <a href="/bw/moves/earthquake">Earthquake</a> as well as <a href="/bw/moves/stone_edge">Stone Edge</a>, since it is the only one naturally fast enough to make use of the power. Excadrill can also make use of it on non-sweeping sets, if you are not too bothered about the massive loss in Speed from not using Sand Rush.</p>
