Overview
########
- The only current Hail setter in the meta-game, Hail is a very useful weather for disrupting opposing weather strategies that could otherwise be deadly.
- Typing gives a very handy Ice-type STAB and resistances to common Electric-, Ground- and Water-type moves.
- Grass-typing now grants it an immunity to Spore.
- Mega Evolution has respectable bulk, great mixed offensive stats, and a low 30 base speed -- tied with Reuinclus and Snorlax -- to make him the fastest Mega Pokemon under Trick Room.
- His typing is a double-edged sword: with handy resistances and powerful STAB comes a whooping 7 weaknesses, including to common Fire-, Fighting- and Steel-type attacks.
- Unable to get past most Steel- and Fire-types, even with coverage moves.
- Hail only lasts 5 turns, which said turn limit can be stalled out now and limits the amount of time using his 100% accurate Blizzard.
- Introduction of many powerful threats to the meta-game make it hard to keep Abomasnow alive, making his natural bulk somewhat insignificant at times.

Mega Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mega Mixed Attacker
move 1: Blizzard
move 2: Wood Hammer / Energy Ball
move 3: Ice Shard
move 4: Protect
ability: Snow Warning
item: Abomasite
EVs: 252 HP / 208 SpA / 48 Atk

Moves
========
- Under Hail, Blizzard won't miss and it hits both opponents for heavy damage.
- Wood Hammer is the preferred move in the second slot to KO both formes of Tyranitar regardless of Sandstorm, and Water-types, and is his strongest move against opponents with high special defense like Aromatisse and Gardevoir.
- However, if recoil is undesirable and survivability is an issue, Giga Drain can be used for healing.
- Ice Shard guarantees KOs even in Trick Room, and can be used to get speedy KOs on Dragon-, Flying- and Ground-types.
- Protect is there to scout for super effective moves the opponent might have, buying a free turn for a teammate and dealing Hail damage to bring something closer to OHKO range.
- Wood Hammer is the can be used in the second slot to KO both formes of Tyranitar regardless of Sandstorm, and Water-types, and is his strongest move against opponents with high special defense like Aromatisse and Gardevoir.

Set Details
========
- This is Abomasnow's best set. Abomasite triggers Mega Evolution, so it's the obvious item of choice.
- EV spread gives Abomasnow respectable bulk while maintaining a threatening offensive presence.
- 48 Atk EVs is enough to give Wood Hammer enough power to OHKO bulky Rotom-W, Jellicent, and Assault Vest Tyranitar, and also gives Ice Shard more power to score the crucial revenge KO on low health opponents or those like Garchomp, Togekiss and Shaymin-S quickly should they survive Blizzard with a Yache Berry or Focus Sash.
- A 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Atk set can be run if you don't feel the need to put EVs in Attack.
- 0 Speed IVs and a Quiet nature guarantee that Abomasnow will be "faster" for the most part under Trick Room, as well as set hail after any other weather setter.

Usage Tips
========
- Mega Abomasnow is the slowest Mega Pokemon out there, therefore, this set requires Trick Room support to take advantage of Mega Abomasnow's low 30 base speed.
- The Hail Abomasnow brings should be used for disrupting opposing weather teams while hitting hard with Blizzard.
- Since Abomasnow needs Trick Room in order to be "fast," he should be reserved for later in the match rather than immediately brought out to allow his partners to set up Trick Room, while also removing any Rain, Sun or Sand upon switching in.
- Note that Snow Warning will activate once again when he Mega evolves: this gives Abomasnow more safety on maintaining Hail against opposing weather setters who plan on switching in. Choosing when to Mega evolve can be crucial to winning the weather war.

Team Options
========
- Good partners to this set are Pokemon who can provide Trick Room and deal with opposing Fire- and Steel-types.
- Chandelure and Jellicent are excellent partners because they provide Trick Room, can provide Will-o-Wisp support, and destroy opposing Steel- and Fire-types, respectively.
- Other good Trick Room setters include Reuniclus and Cresselia, who can provide Helping Hand support as well as deal with Fighting-types. Reuniclus gets bonus points for being immune to Hail.
- Pokemon who have overall good synergy with Abomasnow include Rotom-W, who takes care of Fire-types and burns physical attackers with Will-o-Wisp, and Talonflame, who doesn't mind Trick Room with priority Brave Bird and can deal with Scizor and Escavalier outside of Trick Room.

Other Options
########

- Soundproof can be used in the Mega sets to let Abomasnow get some free switches against Noivern and Exploud's Boomburst, but the ability to set Hail immediately is more useful.
- A Focus Sash set can be useful for baiting a Fire-type or a Steel-type, depending on the coverage move chosen, but might be difficult to use and is very situational.
- A Choice Scarf set can be used to spam fast Blizzards, but the loss of power and freedom to choose moves are extremely restrictive. Due to the drop in usage of Latios and Tornadus, this set might not have much utility in the metagame.

Checks and Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**

- Both formes of Abomasnow can't deal with most Steel- and Fire-types because they resist both of his STAB moves. Most notably, Heatran stands at the top of the list as, without Earthquake, Abomasnow does nothing to it and loses almost all the time.
- Other Steel-types like Escavalier, both Scizor formes, Mega Aggron and Mega Mawile put a full stop to Abomasnow because they can take any hit and OHKO Abomasnow.
- Other Fire-types like Chandelure, Mega Houndoom, and both formes of Blaziken can also survive any hit and OHKO with their Fire STAB moves.
- A special mention goes to Mega Venusaur, as it is the only Grass-type capable of taking Blizzard thanks to Thick Fat and can KO Abomasnow with Sludge Bomb.
- Fighting-types like Conkeldurr and Gallade limit Abomasnow's survivability with their STAB moves, although most of them don't OHKO Mega Abomasnow and need to watch out for Blizzard.

**Priority Moves**

- Due to Abomasnow's poor defensive typing, many common priority moves in the tier are able to deal super effective damage to Abomasnow and severely maim it. Scizor's Bullet Punch, Conkeldurr's Mach Punch and Talonflame's Brave Bird are all priority moves that can take down Abomasnow with ease and much be avoided at all costs.
- Talonflame can OHKO with priority Brave Bird regardless of Trick Room and Flare Blitz, but it still gets hit hard by Blizzard and won't enjoy a surprise Rock Slide from the Focus Sash set.

**Opposing Weather**

- Mega Charizard Y and both formes of Tyranitar can change the weather and OHKO both formes of Abomasnow with Heat Wave and Rock Slide respectively. However, Mega Charizard Y won't enjoy Rock Slide and still takes damage from Blizzard, and both Tyranitar need to watch out for Wood Hammer.

**Other Threats**

- Mega Kangaskhan can easily break through Abomasnow's bulk with her powerful physical attacks, although she takes a lot of damage in return from Blizzard and Wood Hammer.
