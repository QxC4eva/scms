Overview
#######

Deoxys-S is a Pokemon that excels at the specific roles it fills. After its ban last generation, it has come back to OU and made a splash. As a revenge killer, it takes advantage of an incredibly wide offensive movepool and stellar coverage, making it difficult to switch into for offensive and defensive teams alike, as well as provide support for its team with Stealth Rock. It is an incredible dual screens user, with its insane Speed ensuring that screens get up, which gives sweepers a layer of protection against opposing threats so that they can freely set up. The scariest part is that your opponent never knows exactly what it's going to do until it's too late.

However, some factors have limited Deoxys-S's abilities this generation. Priority moves from the likes of Aegislash, Azumarill, Talonflame, (Mega) Scizor, and Mega Pinsir bypass Deoxys-S's excellent Speed, limiting its offensive capabilities. Additionally, Aegislash, the best Pokemon in the tier, threatens it immensely. Overall though, despite these deterrents, Deoxys-S's terrifying versatility and efficiency cement it as one of the best Pokemon in OU.

Revenge Killer
########
name: Revenge Killer
move 1: Psycho Boost
move 2: Superpower
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Knock Off / Stealth Rock
item: Life Orb
evs: 20 Atk / 248 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========

This set fits the role of a revenge killer and frightening attacker with its excellent super effective coverage. Psycho Boost is the STAB move of choice, punishing switch-ins expecting a weaker attack or support move from some other variant of Deoxys-S. The rest of the moves outfit Deoxys-S with the necessary coverage it needs to devastate the opposition. Superpower OHKOes Tyranitar and does enough damage to put pressure on Chansey, even KOing it after a Knock Off. Ice Beam nails Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, and is vital to revenge kill threats such as Latios, Dragonite, and Latias, as well as the rare Noivern. Knock Off is generally preferred in the last slot to cripple defensive answers to Deoxys-S, especially Chansey, and hit Aegislash for super effective damage. However, Stealth Rock is also a compelling option for Deoxys-S to support its team and thus fulfill multiple roles; it definitely forces enough switches to get the hazard up. Hidden Power Fire is an option to OHKO Scizor and 2HKO Ferrothorn, but Scizor will just Bullet Punch Deoxys-S to death, while Knock Off cripples Ferrothorn more than enough.

Set Details
========

The Attack EVs enable Deoxys-S to KO max HP Tyranitar with Superpower. The Speed EVs are enough to outrun Choice Scarf Garchomp, letting Deoxys-S strike first with Ice Beam. The remaining EVs are just enough to maximize Special Attack, pumping up the power of Psycho Boost and Ice Beam to legitimately scary levels.

Usage Tips
========

Deoxys-S is essentially a replacement for a Choice Scarf user, boasting higher Speed than many sweepers when they are at +1 Speed. Throughout the match, you will want to bring it in to revenge kill opposing threats. You can also devastate unprepared teams with its excellent coverage, wearing down checks with attacks from teammates. If you play well and preserve it, this Deoxys-S is one of the best late-game cleaners in existence. Finally, although it should generally be played as a mid-game revenge killer, you can lead with it and bluff the hazard setter, surprising foes that are focused on trying to prevent you from getting hazards up.

Team Options
========

This Deoxys-S variant doesn't really need much support. However, you will generally want some type of entry hazards if Deoxys-S doesn't carry Stealth Rock&mdash;not for any particular threat, but just to wear down opposing threats because it forces many switches. Keeping entry hazards off of your side of the field is also helpful, as in conjunction with Life Orb, they can put Deoxys-S in the KO range of priority attacks. For this role, Excadrill with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin makes an excellent partner, defeating most spinblockers while accomplishing the above tasks. In addition, note that this Deoxys-S isn't really fit for bulkier teams, as it offers basically nothing in the way of defensive synergy, so more offensive teams are the best fit for it.

Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Stealth Rock  Magic Coat
item: Light Clay
evs: 252 HP  4 Def  252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

This set takes a different approach to supporting offensive teams protecting setup sweepers with Reflect and Light Screen. In addition to dual screens, Taunt is mandatory to block opposing setup and slower Taunts. The last slot is basically filler. Stealth Rock is typically preferred to provide an extra level of support, but Magic Coat can be run to ensure screens get up against opposing Deoxys-S and Prankster Taunt users. Knock Off is an alternative option to beat Espeon, which loves to lead against Deoxys-S and set up its own dual screens.

Set Details
========

The EVs are simple, maximizing Deoxys-S's bulk and Speed. A Timid nature minimizes Foul Play and confusion damage, while Light Clay ensures that the screens last as long as possible for partners to set up and deal damage.

Usage Tips
========

With this set, you will generally want to just lead and set up screens. After that, Deoxys-S will have hopefully fainted, but if it hasn't, just sacrifice it on the third turn or switch out if the opponent is trying to stall out your screens. To set Stealth Rock, get up the screen that's going to cushion the foe's attack, set up Stealth Rock, and then set up the second screen. If you have to Taunt or Magic Coat, try and do so before you set up screens so as to maximize their longevity. Defog users are also an issue, so you may not necessarily want to lead with it lest your screens and possible Stealth Rock be immediately removed.

Team Options
========

This Deoxys-S is meant to support hyper offense teams with setup sweepers and frail, powerful attackers. Standouts include Crawdaunt, Aegislash, and Swords Dance Talonflame, but you can literally run any number of attackers and they will benefit from the screens. Swords Dance Bisharp in particular makes for an excellent partner, as Deoxys-S lures out Tyranitar, which it can easily switch into, set up on it as it is forced out, and proceed to seriously damage the opposing team.

Dedicated Hazard Lead
########
name: Dedicated Hazard Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Spikes
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Magic Coat / Superpower
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Jolly

Moves
========

Deoxys-S's flagship set aims to lead and set up hazards. Stealth Rock and Spikes are the hazards in question, wearing down opposing teams so that powerful teammates can rip them to shreds. Taunt is obligatory to prevent opposing setup and slower Taunts from crippling you. With these three moves enabling Deoxys-S to meet its goals, the last slot aims to stop potential blocks. Magic Coat stops Taunt from opposing Deoxys-S and Deoxys-D as well as Prankster Thundurus and Sableye. Finally, Superpower can be run to fell Tyranitar, which with Crunch followed by sandstorm damage can KO Deoxys-S. Knock Off is a possible alternative to hit opposing Deoxys-S and Espeon, which is otherwise a hard stop to Deoxys-S thanks to its ability, Magic Bounce. It also cripples virtually every non-Mega foe by removing its item. For example, this can help against Choice Scarf users (such as Latios), bulky walls with Leftovers, and much more.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment lets you always 2HKO Excadrill with Fire Punch while giving a decent chance (33.2%) to 2HKO physically defensive Ferrothorn (33.2%). It also gives an 81.3% chance to OHKO max HP Tyranitar with Superpower. If using Magic Coat, run a Timid nature to minimize Foul Play and confusion damage, as well as max HP because there's no reason for offensive investment without an attack. Deoxys-S can run potentially Mental Herb over Focus Sash to block Prankster Taunt, eliminating its reliance on Magic Coat for this purpose.

Usage Tips
========

You generally want to lead and start laying hazards immediately. Start with Stealth Rock, as it is the most disruptive hazard, and proceed to set up Spikes until Deoxys-S is KOed. Don't do anything besides set up hazards unless absolutely required, as you never want to risk not getting up anything, which would essentially leave you playing 5-6 against the opponent with no advantage. It is also unwise to lead against teams that carry a potential Defog user or a Rapid Spin Excadrill. When you set up hazards at the beginning, you give them the entire match to remove them, so you should plan to set them up at some point later in the match unless you want to waste Deoxys-S entirely.

Team Options
========

This Deoxys-S caters toward hyper offense teams with powerful attackers that force many switches, such as Aegislash, Talonflame, and Latios, punishing the switches necessary to handle these Pokemon and wearing them down such that they can be defeated later in the match. Without Pokemon like these, Deoxys-S is almost wasted. It is also wise to carry a spinblocker to ensure your hazards aren't just spun away. Gengar doesn't exactly match up that well against any OU spinner, but it fits better with the offensive motif of its team. Alternatively, offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus can be used, boasting some more ability to take hits and the power to sweep or at least dent opposing teams with some Nasty Plot boosted attacks. Finally, you'll want some way to counteract Defog. You can't actually block it with anything&mdash;though proper prediction and offensive pressure will help out&mdash;but you can run Bisharp, which thanks to its ability, Defiant, turns the evasion reduction from Defog into a +2 boost to its Attack, putting it in a position to sweep the opposing team.

Other Options
########

Deoxys-S has a ton of options at its disposal. Another potential set besides the ones listed is a lead Rain Dance setter, which can support Swift Swim users, such as Kingdra, Ludicolo, and Kabutops. Another possible option is a TrickScarf set, which can run defensive investment thanks to its increased Speed from the Choice Scarf, in order to get up the maximum layers of Spikes possible whilst boasting the ability to cripple foes by Tricking its Choice Scarf away. With Nasty Plot, Deoxys-S could theoretically pose a decent threat as a sweeper, but it relies on the full, mixed coverage of the listed revenge killer set to deal much damage as an offensive Pokemon, and setting it up isn't easy due to Deoxys-S's rather unimpressive&mdash;though usable&mdash;defenses. Hazard lead Deoxys-S can opt to run Skill Swap, which prevents Espeon, Xatu, and Mega Absol from bouncing back its hazards.

The revenge killer set has a myriad of potential moves, though the ones listed in the actual set are general best and most optimal. Knock Off can be run for the utility it has in removing the items of opponents, especially crippling to Eviolite users, such as Chansey and Porygon2, and defensive Pokemon that rely on Leftovers as their only means of recovery. It is also Deoxys-S's only way to damage Aegislash substantially. Thunderbolt is an option to revenge kill Dragon Dance Gyarados; however, it falters against Mega variants where Superpower shines, hitting it much harder. Meteor Mash has a niche in enabling Deoxys-S to bypass Sylveon.

Checks & Counters
########

**Priority**: Priority is the best way to take out revenge killer Deoxys-S. Aegislash can KO with a Spell Tag-boosted Shadow Sneak after Stealth Rock damage or two turns of Life Orb recoil, whilst Deoxys-S struggles to do much in return. Talonflame OHKOes Deoxys-S if it has taken one turn of Life Orb damage with a Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird. Azumarill KOes with a Waterfall followed by an Aqua Jet. Bisharp KOes it with Sucker Punch.

**Prankster Users**: Prankster Taunt prevents non-Magic Coat Deoxys-S from getting up any hazards. The most notable users are Thundurus and Sableye. Additionally, a Prankster Thunder Wave from Thundurus cripples revenge killer Deoxys-S for good, taking away its high Speed, and makes setting up hazards more difficult.

**Damaging Weather**: Sandstorm breaks Deoxys-S's Focus Sash. Tyranitar can hit it with Crunch, bringing it down to its sash; the sandstorm it brings finishes off Deoxys-S at the end of the turn, limiting it to setting up just Stealth Rock if it lacks Superpower. Hail has the same effect, and Mega Abomasnow has a high chance to KO with Blizzard and hail damage; running Ice Shard ensures that it will faint.

**Magic Bounce**: Espeon, Xatu, and Mega Absol can bounce back Deoxys-S's hazards, rendering it essentially useless. Espeon also conveniently walls all of its Life Orb-boosted attacks, while Mega Absol can KO it with a Sucker Punch.

**Hazard Removal**: Excadrill, Starmie, Skarmory, Mandibuzz, Latios, and Latias can all remove Deoxys-S's hazards with either Rapid Spin or Defog. With Defog, be sure to watch out for Bisharp, a common Deoxys-S partner that can devastate your team if it comes in on a predicted Defog.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Skarmory and Ferrothorn both handle Deoxys-S's Life Orb-boosted attacks pretty well. Skarmory flat out walls it and can use Defog or set up its own entry hazards with the free turns it gets. Physically defensive Ferrothorn can switch in to anything other than Fire Punch and even take one pretty decently in a pinch, losing about half its health and eliminating Deoxys-S with Gyro Ball + Iron Barbs + Life Orb recoil.

**Determining Deoxys-S's Set**: Team composition is the best way to figure out which set Deoxys-S is running. On any random team, it's probably just running the Life Orb set. However, if it's paired with dangerous setup sweepers that might benefit from screens to set up, be prepared for it to go for the screens. Or, if it's on a rain team, expect it to lead and set up Stealth Rock + Rain Dance.
