Overview
########

    Has always been a GARBAGE mon, but STICKY WEB makes it usable/even viable now!
    Still pretty weak even w/ Hydro Pump for Water STAB
    Can threaten Gligar, the most common user of Defog
    Has no bulk so if the opponent has a Defog user/spinner, you're kind of forced to keep it around until that mon has died
    There are tons of Flying-types/Levitate mons, so Sticky Web in general isn't always the best

move 1: Sticky Web
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Signal Beam
move 4: Baton Pass / Ice Beam

Moves
========

    Sticky Web is kind of the whole reason to use it
    Hydro Pump for strong STAB
    Signal Beam for weak STAB but it doesn't get Bug Buzz soooo
    Baton Pass is totally just filler, but cool for scouting I guess
    Ice Beam is also totally just filler but gives you a guaranteed hit against Gligar and other Flying-types w/o having to risk missing Hydro!
    The last slot is really flexible and will rarely see much usage, so put whatever you want there

Set Details
========

    EVs are the epitome of efficiency
    Timid because Speed is the most important factor of the set
    Sash because it's not very strong or bulky, so getting nearly guaranteed Sticky Web is really, really nice

Usage Tips
========

    Unless you have a dedicated counter to Pawniard, if the opponent is using Pawniard, do not set Sticky Web until it dies because Defiant will give it a +2 Atk boost and it will destroy you
    Similarly, if the opponent has a Defog user or spinner that can easily come in and get rid of Sticky Web, it's best to hang onto Surskit until later
    And of course, if you look at Team Preview and see that Sticky Web won't be very important in the match, feel free to hang onto Surskit as a way of revenge killing stuff thanks to Sash!

Team Options
========

    Moderately slow but super strong stuff makes for the best kind of Surskit partner; Life Orb Bunnelby, Life Orb Meditite, Life Orb Mienfoo, Swords Dance Pawniard, etc. are all great Pokemon for this role
    Because Defiant Pawniard shits all over Sticky Web teams, bulky Fighting-types are also nice to use alongside Surskit, especially Timburr and Croagunk who have STAB Fighting priority
    Misdreavus is a solid spinblocker to keep the opponent from spinning away your Web
    Pawniard can also take advantage of Defog from Vullaby (and Gligar if you're willing to risk it!) by getting a +2 Atk boost thanks to Defiant
    Smash Dwebble can set up all over Surskit and then kill it, so Eviolite Mienfoo and Gligar are really nice to help deal with it

Other Options
########

    Offensive Swift Swim set, but it's outclassed by, oh, pretty much every other Pokemon that has Swift Swim lol
    Giga Drain, Scald, Icy Wind, Struggle Bug for alternate STABs/coverage moves
    Can set up Rain Dance as well for a rain team, but rain + Sticky Web is kind of overkill @_@
    Protect can be used as filler to keep Fake Out users from breaking Sash
    Haze can be another filler, but most boosters just kill it before it can pull it off anyways

Checks & Counters
########

    Checking/countering Surskit really isn't about walling it, but either preventing it from setting up Sticky Web/getting rid of its Sticky Web
    Meowth can prevent it from setting up Sticky Web with Fake Out + any attack and outspeeds it
    Vullaby and Tentacool can get rid of Sticky Web without really fearing much from Surskit
    Pawniard can take advantage of Sticky Web in order to get +2 Atk w/ Defiant and can even set up a Swords Dance against Surskit
    Lead Smash Dwebble can set up against Surskit and either tank a Hydro and get back to full w/ BJ or not care about web being set up and keep bj + sturdy intact and KO through sash w/ Rock Blast
    Inkay gets a +1 Speed boost upon switching into Sticky Web
    A lot of top threats just don't generally care about/are immune Sticky Web, including Yanma, Murkrow, Tangela, and Gligar
