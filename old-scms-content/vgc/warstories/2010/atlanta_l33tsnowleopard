[page]
<p>Well, my cosmically amusing warstory. I guess the place to start is at the beginning.</p>

<h2>1) The Preparation (In Which There Wasn't Much)</h2>
<p>My preparation consisted of a few practise battles, noting much. Mainly with Feathers (thanks for the item advice ^_^). Which leads to the team:</p>

<h2>2)The Team</h2>

<p>Dusknoir aka Dismas w/ Sitrus Berry<br />
Trick Room, Pain Spit, Shadow Sneak, Nightshade<br />
Imo, the best at setting up TR. He was EVed to take a Water Spout to the face, or a Sucker Punch, or whatever, and set up TR. Then, Pain Split if he has had alot of damage, or Shadow Sneak, if there are Turn 1 survivors.</p>

<p>Snorlax aka Lil'Bear w/ Lum Berry<br />
Counter, Fire Punch, Selfdestruct, Protect<br />
He makes the team, what can I say? Turned out to be the best addition to the team. Basically, I would protect if I predicted Fake Out, and if not, Selfdestruct. Counter saved my butt in round 2, actually. I got mach punched, and countered it back :D</p>

<p>Kyogre aka some sort of Japanese kanji I can't read w/ Iron Ball<br />
Water Spout, Thunder, Ice Beam, Protect<br />
Your average Kyogre, just with stats for TR</p>

<p>Dialga aka Dialga w/ Expert Belt<br />
Blizzard, Flamethrower, Dragon Pulse, Trick Room<br />
A secondary TR if things went longer than expected. Flamethrower for Aboma, Dragon Pulse for STAB, and Blizzard, which was his most useful move. I highly recommend Blizzard for anyone using Dialga, over say, Thunder. It works great, even if weather is interrupted by Aboma.</p>

<p>I don't really have much to say for the team. It did as good as I had hoped. If anyone needs an emergency team or something, I'd be happy to lend this one out. I think if I had replaced Night Shade w/ Protect, and Trick Room on Dialga for Protect, things would have gone differently. Night Shade was never used, neither was Dialga's Trick Room.</p>

<h2>3) Preparing To Leave (In Which I Am Sabotaged By A Cat)</h2>
<p>The night before, I packed my bag with my DS and my heartgold, and a suitcase with clothes. I travel light :P. Then, I went to sleep. The next morning, I woke up at 6.00, played Splinter Cell Conviction (good game, too much cursing imo though). At about 12.00, we packed the car and got ready to go. Then my mom's cat tried to run outside, but I caught the bugger in the garage. I wasn't going to let him delay my trip. OOAH!</p>

<h2>4) The Drive Down (In Which My Father Uses Music As A Weapon)</h2>
<p>It was a five hour drive down to Atlanta from Columbia, South Carolina. 3 of those hours I involuntarily listened to Werewolves in London. The conversation to turn it off:<br />
Me: Please turn it down.<br />
Dad: What?<br />
Me: Please turn down the music, dad.<br />
Dad: Speak up!!!<br />
Me: TURN OFF THE MUSIC!!!<br />
(My dad fades the music so it's louder up front, but quieter where I am)<br />
Mom: Turn off the !&@%*!@ music! Now it's too loud up here<br />
Dad: Fine.<br />
The other two hours, Werewolves in London played through my head... It wasn't fun, exactly.</p>

<h2>5) The Night Before The Tournament (In Which There Is A Monster Under My Bed)</h2>

<p>I stayed with my aunt and uncle. And under my bed sometimes is a small, furry cat, that swipes at my feet. The first time this happened was when I was putting my stuff in my room. It was 7.00, so I thought nothing of it. At 2.00 in the morning, however, when I had forgotten I wasn't at my house, that furry little paw scared the crap out of me. Still, a nice cat. Just alarming at 2.00.</p>

<h2>6) The Tournament (In Which I Confirm The Existence Of God, Because I Heard Him Snicker)</h2>

<p>I arrived at about 9.00. I watched some of the juniors play, met up with Noxe and mattj, and some other people whose names I don't know. I also met Marriland, which was awesome. One of the juniors made me laugh, she used Draco Meteor like 3 times in a row We hung out, then I went to get a Sprite (3.75 for a Sprite, really?). She still won, somehow. Anyhow, I went to go wait in line a little after everyone else. I talked to this kid who flew in from DC that morning, and my uncle talked to his dad about businesses and the like. His name was TJ, and he wasn't quite done finishing his team. I helped him while we were waiting, which made the time go faster, and he was pretty nervous. He didn't have any Ubers, because he thought they were cheap. Which I respect. I helped him out with items and his last slot, and what to play, etc. My wristband number was 25, which is Pikachu, so that was cool. There were 4 people in front of me from South Carolina also, but I didn't really talk to them. Then, I went to Round 1 :)</p>

<h3>Round 1 (In Which I Pwn)</h3>
<p>This guy's team was Electivire, Raichu, Charizard, and Snorlax. I don't really know what he was going for, all I know was it didn't work. Raichu used Thunder and missed, Electivire used Cross Chop for half damage on Snorlax, and I used TR and Selfdestruct, knocking out both of his pokemon. On Charizard and Snorlax, water spout finished him off. I move on to Round 2, 3-0.</p>

<h3>Round 2 (In Which I Learn The Value Of Prediction)</h3>
<p>I think this guy was from Smogon, but I didn't catch his name. Correct me on this, dude. He used Hitmontop and Giratina-O, followed with Abomasnow and Kyogre. I used TR and Protected with Snorlax as planned, blocked Fake Out, and Giratina used Shadow Force. I knew he was going for Dusknoir, so I switched to Dialga, and used Counter on Snorlax, expecting Mach Punch. Everything worked perfectly for me. Mach Punch's Counter OHKOed Top, Giratina O brought Dialga to half. He brought Abomasnow, which was a horrible mistake. With TR up, Snorlax's Fire Punch put Aboma in the red, Blizzard put Giratina in the red and finished Aboma. Then hail killed Giratina, leaving Dialga w/ 4 HP. I forgot what I did to finish off Kyogre, I was really excited.</p>

<h3>Round 3 (In Which God Laughs At Me)</h3>
<p>This was where I screwed up. I said, "I'm happy I made it this far, I don't mind if I lose." And then I did. A perfect example of irony... Ah well. I won't give a commentary, bc I saved the battle video, I just haven't uploaded it yet.</p>

<p>On balance, I had a great time. I got a free bag, a shiny eevee, met some cool people, and played well. What more could I do?</p>

<h2>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h2>
<h3>The Good:</h3>
<ul>
<li>godudette-for giving me 75% of what I need Wednesday night. Mercy is a good thing</li>
<li>monsoonbeast-for rnging Dusknoir Thursday night. I need that, thanks :P</li>
<li>mattj- for being cool (the kyogre was his anyhow)</li>
<li>noxe- if he hadn't been as nice as he had been, I probably would have been scared and not talked to anyone after that. I can be shy</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Bad:</h3>
<ul>
<li>TJ losing in the first round after flying in from DC</li>
<li>My memory (sorry for all the blank parts and the people I left out)</li>
<li>Me saying I didn't want to play mattj at round 3 (another chuckle from God). No offense, mattj, but I think I could have beaten you because I was so prepared for a team like yours</li>
<li>TCPi not having a vendor or something. I had money to buy a souvenir</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Ugly:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not enough chairs. My back hurts like a mother after all this.</li>
<li>The fire marshall. I really wish he would stop telling everybody to leave. I left when I felt like it.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, I wrote this like all great literature. In the format of AA Milne's Winnie the Pooh. If you don't like it, take a leap. That is the best book in the history of the world. </p>
