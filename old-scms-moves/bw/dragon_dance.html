<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack and Speed stats by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Arguably the best set-up move for most physical sweepers, Dragon Dance can make a Pokemon ready to sweep after only one turn of set-up. Most Pokemon who learn Dragon Dance can make good use of it, and even though some of those sets fell into obscurity due to the rise of new threats in the fifth generation, it's still a force with which to be reckoned. Watch out for Dragonite, Salamence, and Kingdra, as a single Dragon Dance can make them unstoppable.</p>
