<p>For those of you who are not familiar with the Challenges room on PS!, we offer many challenges every week for you to attempt to complete on the ladders of various tiers. Completing challenges earns you points that go towards our weekly leaderboard. What many users don't think about is how to earn the maximum number of points through challenges, so this article is made for users to get some tips on how they can do well with the challenges of each week and how they can be on the top of the leaderboard.</p>

  <h2>1. Know your Elo</h2>
<p>Each time we verify one of your challenges, we use your Elo rating in order to determine how many points you are awarded; putting it in a simpler example, the lower your Elo, the lower your score will be, and the higher your Elo rating, the more points you will gain. What many users try to do to prevent their personal account's Elo rating from being lowered is make an alternate account and starting with the lowest rating that they can get. Our advice is to not do this straight away, as we think that in order to improve the number of points that you gain, you should try to win some battles on an alternate account and then attempt the challenge, as this can increase your leaderboard points. If you do the challenge with a higher Elo rating, you will gain more points.</p>

  <h2>2. Think before you attempt</h2>
<p>Many users just read the challenge they're trying to attempt but donâ€™t think much about it. This is more common with the medium and hard challenges in the room. Before you attempt a challenge, try to think of a strategy that can make you win the challenge quickly without affecting your Elo rating too much. Think about what tier you will try to attempt the challenge in, what the common threats in that tier are, and how can you complete the challenge with those threats. Simple thinking with these challenges can help you gain more points.</p>

<h2>3. Read the challenge twice</h2>

<p>One thing that challengers get stressed about is getting their challenge denied because they didn't do something correctly. All of that hard work towards a challenge wasted, all because they forgot to read a small detail in the challenge description. This is common with the tiers that they battled in. For example, the challenge requires you do a specific challenge in UU, but they attempted the challenge in OU. In order to avoid this common mistake, we urge you to read the description thoroughly so that you understand the criteria needed to complete this challenge without any mistakes.</p>

<h2>4. Ask the chat for advice</h2>

<p>We encourage you to share some ideas on how you can successfully complete a challenge and help users to complete these challenges. Not everyone in the room (or even on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown!) are established battlers, and many will appreciate advice no matter how small or large. Don't be afraid to ask for help in the room, as discussion can range from advice to discussing future challenges.</p>

  <h2>5. Have fun</h2>
<p>People do get annoyed when they have to attempt a challenge over and over again to try and complete it for the points, but we want users to have fun! We want to show you how exciting the room can be and how you can have fun in the room whilst attempting more challenges. Don't forget that every week, new challenges are offered, giving more opportunities to gain points on our weekly leaderboard, which will be displayed on the room intro so that you can keep yourself up-to-date with the positions of other users, including that of your own!</p>
<p>Using these 5 tips can benefit your experience in the room and make it as enjoyable as it can possibly be. If you feel that you need to ask any questions, feel free to PM any staff member or even ask in the chat, as many users are familiar with the Challenges rules and can answer your question quickly!</p>
