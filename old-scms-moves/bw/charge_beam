<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 70% chance to boost the user's Special Attack by one stage. The move does not give a boost if it misses or has no effect on the opponent.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Charge Beam is not an especially reliable way of boosting Special Attack, and is not likely to do significant damage in most circumstances, but this move is seen on occasion. Notably, this move can be used on Pokemon with no better way of boosting Special Attack, such as Magnezone, which can easily use Substitute and Charge Beam up on a hapless Steel-type. Also, it can be used on Pokemon such as Jolteon as something of a filler move, to finish off heavily weakened opponents while boosting Special Attack at the same time.</p>
