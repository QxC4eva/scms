Overview
########

Transition to XY was rather beneficial to Scarfty
The Knock Off buff was huge, allowing Scrafty to cripple the foe by removing their item, while also giving it a powerful, reliable STAB attack on the first hit
The Assault Vest is another great addition to Scrafty's inventory and combined with Intimidate, makes Scrafty incredibly hard to take down
Still has gems such as Drain Punch, Fake Out, and Intimidate, making it a superb supportive threat in the metagame
The newly added Fairy-type pokemon give Scrafty a large amount of trouble, as they not only resist its STAB moves, but are able to easily OHKO Scrafty with their STAB Fairy-type attacks
Scrafty is also weak to other common attacking-types such as Fighting and Flying
Faces competition from Hitmontop due to its faster Fake Out, as well as access to moves such as Close Combat and Wide Guard
Average attack and abysmal Speed stats

Fake Out allows Scrafty to prevent one of the opponents Pokemon from doing anything, giving your partner a free turn

Drain Punch is Scrafty's secondary STAB attack, hitting Pokemon such as Tyranitar for super effective damage, recovering Scrafty's health and getting great nuetral coverage with Knock Off
Stone Edge is used to hit flying type such as Thundurus and Charizard Y for super effective damage
Ice Punch can be used over Stone Edge to hit Landorus-T, Salamence, Shaymin-S and Garchomp harder
Detect can be used if using a Sitrus Berry, as it allows Scrafty to scout for Fake out and a potential super effective attack

Set Details
========

Given EV spread allows Scrafty to take a Life Orb-boosted Secret Swords from Keldeo as well as 2 Heat Wave from Charizard Y if using the Assault Vest
248 HP / 196 Atk / 64 SpD should be the main spread if using the Sitrus Berry as it allows Scrafty to survive Modest Charizard Y's Overheat
A Brave nature w/ 0 Speed IVs can be used if Scrafty is being used on a Trick Room team
Assault Vest is the recommended item, making Scrafty incredibly bulky on both sides of the spectrum
Sitrus Berry is also very viable option as it allows Scrafty to recover a large portion of its health from potentially fatal attacks
An alternate spread of 252 HP / 180 Atk / 56 Def / 20 SpD could be used, as it allows Scrafty to Avoid a 2HKO from Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave and Mega Kangaskhan's Double Edge, as well as avoid a OHKO from Mega Kangaskhan's Return f it is at +1
Lum Berry is also a viable option to protect Scrafty from status moves
252 HP / 188 Atk / 64 SpD
Chople Berry is another decent item that can be used to allow Scrafty to survive powerful attacks such as Hitmontop's Close Combat

Usage Tips
========
Best used early-game as Scrafty can give free turns to Pokemon like Scizor, Heatran, and Garchomp due to Fake Out + Intimidate
Can still work well later in the match as a pivot due to the utility of Fake Out and Intimidate
Best to switch out of Will-O-wisp users such as Rotom-W, as Scrafty becomes somewhat useless when burned. Still has a great amount of utility thanks to Knock Off, Fake Out, and Intimidate.
Avoid switching into Pokemon with the Defiant ability such as Bisharp and Tornadus
Works well against Trick Room teams, as it can beat common Trick Room users with Fake Out and Knock Off
Scrafty is best used to cause havoc, as well as support its team, with the combined utility Knock Off, Intimidate, and Fake Out.

Team Options
========
Aegislash is a great partner, as it resist most of Scrafty's weaknesses and can defeat common Fairy- and Fighting-types
Bisharp is able to defeat Fairy-types and can pressure intimidate users with Defiant. It does share a Fighting-type weakness with Scrafty, however
Scizor is also a great partner as it can defeat Fairy-types that generally give Scarfty trouble with Bullet Punch and appreciates Scarfty's ability to lure and remove Landorus-T and Charizard Y depending on what coverage move it uses
Landorus-T is an alright partner for Scrafty, as it appreciates the free turns provides by Fake Out as well as Scrafty's ability to defeat Psychic-types. Landorus-T also resist Scrafty's Fighting-type weakness and can form a "double Intimidate core with Scrafty.
Scrafty works fairly well on Trick Room teams due to its great typing, Intimidate, and Fake Out, making Pokemon such as Cresselia, Aromatisse, and Mawile great partners
Rotom-W is also a nice partner, as it can handle Flying-types such as Talonflame, while also checking Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Hitmontop with Will-O-wisp
Other Options
########

Quick Guard can be used to protect Scrafty from Priority attacks, but forces Scrafty to use Crunch as its main Dark-type STAB move
High Jump Kick and Low Kick can be used as more powerful, abeilt less consistant Fighting-type STAB attacks
Taunt can be used to stop Trick Room setters such as Dusclops from doing anything
Fire Punch for Scizor, Genesect, and Mawile
Iron Head / Poison Jab for Fairies
Bulk Up and Dragon Dance can be used to allow Sacrfty to function as a setup sweeper
Foul Play and super Fang can be used for a more defensive set
Zen Headbutt can be used to hit Poison-types such as Venusaur harder


Checks & Counters
########

**Attack Control**
Both Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp severally hinder Scrafty's preformance in doubles
Hitmontop and Mawile are the best Pokemon with Intimidate that can check Scrafty, as they are not weak to any of Scrafty's moves and can retaliate with a powerful Close Combat and Play Rough, respectively
Landorus-T and Gyarados are also good checks, although both dislike taking ice Punch and Stone Edge respectively
Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-W and Sableye are able to completely cripple Scrafty with Will-O-Wisp
**Offensive Typing Advantage**
Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Gardevoir, Azumarill, and Mawile resist Scrafty's STAB attacks and are able to easily able to KO Scrafty with their 4x super effective Fairy-type attacks
Flying- and Fighting-types such as Talonflame and Terrakion are also good checks, as they can hit Scarfty for super effective damage with their respective STAB moves. Terrakion also benefits from Knock off thanks to its ability. However, both of these Pokemon may lose if Scrafty is able to use Fake Out on them, but that primarily depends on Scrafty's partners that are currently out.
**Bulky Mega Evolutions**
Mega evolutions that are not weak to any of Scrafty's moves and are relatively bulky such as Mega Venusaur, Mega Heracross, Mega Scizor, and Mega Pinsir are great checks, as they can switch into Knock Off with little to no repercussion and are able to deal major damage in return.
**Utility Moves**:
A Faster Fake Out from Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan or Hitmontop can prevent Scrafty from offering Fake Out support.
