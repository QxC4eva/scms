[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is hit by a Dark-type move, its Attack is raised one stage. An Attack boost will be granted for each hit of a multi-hit attack.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Getting a free Attack boost by simply switching into a Dark-type attack seems like an awesome ability to have at first glance. However, the conditions are extremely situational, not to mention the fact that Dark-type attacks are relatively rare in most of the tiers (with the exception of <a href="/bw/moves/pursuit">Pursuit</a>, but your Pokemon with Justified can't switch into that). Luckily, most of the Pokemon that receive Justified can make good use of a free Attack boost and have little problem switching in on most Dark-type attacks. Justified should really only be used if no better or consistent ability is available.</p>
