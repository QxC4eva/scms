Monthly Art Contest #4: Dragon's Den

[page]

Still, the Dragon's Den of Johto has always been a location shrouded in mystery through both its secretive nature and the mysticism of the type it represents. From what better, then, is there to draw inspiration? There were a variety of interpretations, some of which more creative than others (that is: Shinxe...).</p>
