Varies in power depending on number of boosts accumulated by user.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Power is equal to 20+(X*20), where X is the user's total stat stage changes that are greater than 0 (including evasion and accuracy), for a combined maximum of 860. Does not decrease in power if any stat drops below the level +0.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While Stored Power has a pathetic Base Power of 20, it is quickly enhanced from boosting the user's stats, receiving 20 additional Base Power per boost. Part of Moody's banishment from OU and even Ubers was due to the fact that Smeargle could gain as many stat boosts as it needed, then either Baton Pass the boosts to a teammate, or outright sweep with Stored Power. Moody's banishment aside, Sigilyph is probably the most powerful user. By stalling the opponent with a burn from Flame Orb + Psycho Shift, Roosting off any damage taken, all the while boosting its defenses with Cosmic Power, it can give Stored Power a boost of 40 each turn, allowing Sigilyph to do massive damage when it needs to attack.</p>
