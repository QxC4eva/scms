Overview
########

With very few viable users of Wish in OU, Vaporeon has carved itself a niche as one of the best users of the move. Maximum HP investment allows Vaporeon to pass Wishes of 232 HP, restoring a massive chunk of any Pokemon's health. Vaporeon's mono-Water typing is solid defensively, with only two weaknesses and four resistances. Water Absorb turns one of those resistances into an immunity, and makes Vaporeon a great check to Water-types, allowing it to switch into Pokemon such as Greninja relatively safely. Water Absorb is also especially useful in discouraging the use of Scald, which is otherwise one of the safest moves in the game. Vaporeon is still a solid member of a Baton Pass team, able to utilize large Substitutes among its many support options to keep the chain going.

Not all change is good, and the new weather mechanics have made Hydration stalling effectively useless. Powerful new attackers such as Thundurus and Mega Venusaur can make life hard on Vaporeon, and Vaporeon can become set-up bait for sweepers if it does not run Roar or Toxic. Vaporeon is not a Pokemon that can simply be thrown onto a team and expected to wall everything, but can do its job very well with proper support.

Wish Support
########
name: Wish Support
move 1: Wish
move 2: Protect
move 3: Scald
move 4: Roar / Toxic / Heal Bell
ability: Water Absorb
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD


Moves
========

Wish is the main move on the set, healing either 50% of Vaporeon's health or 232 points of a teammate's health. Protect ensures that Vaporeon will be healed by its own Wish, and can be used to scout opponent's moves. Scald has an incredibly useful 30% chance to burn the opponent, and hits decently hard off of Vaporeon's base 110 Special Attack stat. Roar allows Vaporeon to phaze out potential counters or set-up sweepers, and chip away at the opponent's health with hazard support. Toxic allows Vaporeon to cripple most walls, and cause reliable damage on things it may not be able to hurt. Heal Bell can be used for a full cleric type set while helping Vaporeon no longer fear Toxic, but also makes Vaporeon extreme set-up bait if your opponent notices you lack both Toxic and Roar. Ice Beam provides good coverage with Scald, but isn't particularly powerful without investment and can struggle to deal damage even to Pokemon that are weak to it, such as Trevanent or Celebi. Haze allows Vaporeon to stop Baton Pass teams dead in their tracks, and also has the benefit of being nearly unblockable, but has a tough time finding a slot in its moves.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP investment allows you to pass the largest Wishes possible, and a Bold Nature with maximum defense is used take hits from physical attackers to complement Vaporeon's naturally high special bulk. With maximum defense investment, Vaporeon can comfortably take hits from support Landorus-T and Scizor while threatening back with Scald. Leftovers is an obvious choice for a defensive Pokemon, and allows Vaporeon to get some extra health back as it uses Protect.

Usage Tips
========

Vaporeon attracts Toxic like a magnet, avoiding it through the use of Protect and switches will go a long way in increasing Vaporeon's survivability. The use of repeated Wishes puts your opponent in a situation where they will start trying to predict your passes; pay attention to how your opponent responds after a Wish, because you don't want a Pokemon to faint on a predicted switch. Before you need to pass Wishes, Scald is the move of choice, able to do decent damage and potentially burn anything that comes in. If you're using Toxic, determine which status between Toxic poison and Burn status would be more detrimental to your opponent's team; this can be loosely determined in the Team Preview. If you're using Roar, it's important to keep Vaporeon healthy since you have to take a hit in order to Roar an opposing Pokemon out.

Team Options
========

Mega Venusaur resists both of Vaporeon's weaknesses, is immune to Toxic, and greatly appreciates the healing Wish provides since it cannot hold Leftovers. Ferrothorn and Heatran from an excellent Water-Fire-Grass core with Vaporeon, patching up each other's weaknesses and spreading hazards and status. Skarmory is capable of taking most physical attacks aimed at Vaporeon, and can lay down hazards or phaze opponents. Support Landorus-T functions similarly with Stealth Rock, and can U-Turn to maintain momentum. While that group spreads hazards, Excadrill can switch in on predicted Electric-type attacks aimed at Vaporeon and proceed to Rapid Spin any hazards away. Goodra is capable of easily sponging Grass and Electric-type special moves aimed at Vaporeon, but fears Toxic just as much as Vaporeon does.

Baton Passer
########
name: Baton Passer
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Scald / Acid Armor
move 4: Roar / Wish / Acid Armor
ability: Water Absorb
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 244 HP / 136 Def / 128 Spe

Moves
========
Baton Pass can let Vaporeon pass different types of boosts that it or a teammate has accumulated, and Vaporeon functions well as an effective early to mid chain Baton Passer. Vaporeon can pass some of the largest Substitutes in Pokemon, which can complemented further by boosted defenses. Scald is there to prevent Vaporeon from being complete Taunt bait, and has the added benefit of being able to burn physical attackers trying to break Vaporeon. Roar prevents Vaporeon from being phazed out, and can be especially useful if Vaporeon has been passed speed boosts, as this will allow Vaporeon's Roar to go before the opponent's Roar or Whirlwind. Wish is Vaporeon's main niche in the standard set, and can be very useful in a Baton Passs set as well, reliably healing teammates who cannot heal themselves. Vaporeon's natural bulk makes it incredibly effective at increasing the chain's defense with Acid Armor, and makes its Substitutes harder to break. Aqua Ring can be used to grant the entire chain permanent extra recovery, and is the equivalent of a free Leftovers. Wish can be used to recover HP somewhat reliably and create more Substitutes if necessary, but if you're taking that much damage it's probably better to switch to a Pokemon more suitable to handle the threat. As with many Baton Pass chain Pokemon, the moves you run on Vaporeon should be suited to the team's needs. While Baton Pass and Substitute are necessary, any combination of the other listed moves is feasible if your team already has someone to pass defense boosts or has Ingrain to prevent Roar + Whirlwind phazing.

Set Details
========

128 Speed EVs allow Vaporeon at +2 to outspeed plus nature base 130 Pokemon, which is the highest relevant non-Deoxys speed tier in OU. 244 HP allows Vaporeon to make the largest HP Substitutes that it can while maintaining an entry hazard number, which is important since Baton Pass teams dictate plenty of switching. The remaining EVs are put into its weaker physical defense stat to maximize the defensive boosts and keep Vaporeon as bulky as possible. For the same reason, a Bold nature is also used to improve physical defense. Leftovers are the obvious choice for an item, and help Vaporeon make as many Substitutes as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Substitute is something that needs to be kept up at all times as the chain is setting up to prevent status and guard against critical hits, and Vaporeon can make the largest Substitutes of any Pokemon that has access to Baton Pass. If for whatever reason there isn't a Substitute up, play as though you are always going to get hit with a critical hit. The last thing you want is to lose all of the boosts you have accumulated because a random critical hit broke through something. Roar + Whirlwind users are usually predictable, if your opponent sends in something like Skarmory always Roar immediately even if it means eating a Brave Bird or giving up a layer of Spikes. If Ingrain has been passed, Vaporeon becomes nearly impossible to phaze, since Roar and Whirlwind will no longer work and Dragon Tail will not do enough damage to break a Substitute at +2.

Team Options
========

Pokemon such as Scolipede and Gliscor that can pass speed boosts are necessary in any Baton Pass team, aiding both Vaporeon and the chain as a whole. Gliscor also has access to a fast Taunt, preventing opponents from using status or phazing moves. Smeargle can pass Ingrain to prevent Vaporeon from being Roared or Whirlwinded away, or Shell Smash to increase Vaporeon's speed. Mr. Mime with Soundproof and Encore can form a Baton Passing duo with Vaporeon that can effectively neutralize any Pokemon trying to set up alongside the chain. Vaporeon can follow Scizor in a chain as it appreciates the Iron Defense that Scizor passes, and Scizor draws the Fire-type moves that Vaporeon can set up on. As far as Baton Pass receivers, Espeon makes a great chain receiver with Magic Bounce and Stored Power, as does an Ingrained Clefable with Magic Guard. Kyurem-B and Mega-Lucario also fall into this category, but using overwhelming power instead of abilities.

Other Options
########

Hidden Power Fire can be used to beat Ferrothorn, but has almost no use outside of that. Similarly, Hidden Power Grass helps Vaporeon get through Gastrodon or Quagsire, but both of those are vulnerable to Toxic anyway, and 4 SpAtk Vaporeon can only 2HKO, meaning you will get hit with Toxic in return. Surf can be used over Scald for the slight power boost, but Vaporeon needs the burn chance much more than the power.

Checks & Counters
########

- **Status immune/resistant Pokemon**: Pokemon with high Special Defense and Natural Cure such as Blissey and Chansey leave Vaporeon unable to do anything and threaten with Toxic. Celebi also falls into the category, and has Perish Song to completely shatter Baton Pass teams. Users of Magic Guard render Vaporeon's Scald burns and Toxic poison attempts useless, and Reuniclus can Calm Mind in Vaporeon's face while only being phazed out at best. Clefable functions in a similar way, and can use boosted Moonblasts to break through Vaporeon after a couple of boosts.

- **Bulky Grass-types**: Vaporeon absolutely hates Leech Seed, as its large health total becomes a liability and allows opponents to regain large chunks of HP at once. Ferrothorn is one of the best Vaporeon switches in the game, capable of setting up hazards in its face or hitting Vaporeon with Leech Seed. Mega-Venusaur is immune to Toxic and only slightly cares about burns, and can hit Vaporeon with either Leech Seed or Giga Drain to recover HP as well as damage. Poison Heal Breloom is only afraid of the uncommon Ice Beam, while Technician Breloom can easily OHKO with Bullet Seed as long as it avoids burn status.

- **Electric-types**: Most Electric-types are frail special attackers, and don't particularly care about burn or Toxic. Life Orb Thundurus is strong enough to have a 75% chance to OHKO Vaporeon with Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock damage. While Rotom-W's Volt Switch does not do a lot of damage, Rotom-W can Toxic Vaporeon or use Volt Switch to gain momentum while taking pittance from any Vaporeon's moves. Zapdos also cleanly 2HKOs Vaporeon while it can only manage to Toxic Zapdos in return. While it is not an Electric-type itself, Expert Belt Genesect's Thunderbolt hits like one, and will easily 2HKO Vaporeon.

- **Set-Up Sweepers**: Espeon can Calm Mind in front of Vaporeon, and cannot be Roared out due to Magic Bounce. If Vaporeon does not run Roar Substitute set-up sweepers become a massive problem, especially ones that resist Water such as Kyurem-B and Gyarados. Lum Berry Haxorus can Dragon Dance against Vaporeon and then 2HKO with Dragon Claw if Vaporeon has any prior damage while having insurance against a burn. Mega-Lucario can set up Swords Dance in front of Vaporeon, while Vaporeon can only attempt to burn with Scald in return. Nasty Plot Celebi can tank even super effective Ice Beams easily, Giga Drain to recover huge chunks of its health, and Baton Pass to pass on any boosts it may accumulate.
