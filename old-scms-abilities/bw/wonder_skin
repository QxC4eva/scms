<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is targeted by a non-attacking move with an accuracy check, its accuracy is set to the minimum between 50% and the move's original accuracy. Wonder Skin adjusts the accuracy before any other modifiers take effect. Wonder Skin does not change the accuracy of non-attacking moves that already have an accuracy below 50%.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Wonder Skin is only available on 4 Pokemon, and 3 of them are as Dream World abilities only at this time. Wonder Skin has extremely limited competitive use, but may find some niche uses on <a href="/bw/pokemon/venomoth">Venomoth</a>.</p>
