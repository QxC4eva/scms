Increases power of multi-turn trapping moves.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The damage dealt at the end of the turn by multi-turn trapping moves (Bind, Clamp, Fire Spin, Magma Storm, Sand Tomb, Whirlpool, Wrap) is increased from 6.25% to 12.5% of the target's maximum HP.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Partial trapping moves are not often seen competitively, for the simple reason that they do very little damage to the opponent, take up a whole moveslot, and likely will trap something that can actually fight back (if the opponent could not do anything to you, they would either switch out or stay in expecting to be KOed, and getting rid of an opponent's Pokemon is almost always the more favorable turn of events), so you will waste a turn and a moveslot doing very little, especially as all effects of these moves are lost when the user switches out. For this reason, even with something like Heatran's Magma Storm, you are unlikely to get more than one turn's worth of damageâ€”in which case you can deal more damage to the opponent by using a power-boosting item such as Life Orb. Binding Band is a poor item, competitively, but at least it's better than Grip Claw.</p>
