<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Defense and Special Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>One of the Vespiquen's signature moves. For that reason, only two Pokemon are able to execute it. As for Vespiquen, she usually doesn't have either the typing to abuse it, or the time available to gather enough boosts in most competitive battles. Theoretically, even if she could gather enough boosts she would still miss the power to force her way against most bulky walls, regardless. As for Smeargle, it can be useful on Baton Pass teams if you, flavor wise, aren't using Cosmic Power, which does exactly the same thing.</p>
