Overview
########

    Quite possibly the most annoying Pokemon in the OU metagame
    Prankster + Spikes is stupidly good, allowing to set up multiple layers of entry hazards with ease
    Prankster + Reflect + Light Screen is just as effective for being just as easy to set up
    One of the best defensive typings in the entire game giving it a list of resistances
    Wide variety of support moves allows it to play a few good roles
    Lack of offensive presence makes it rather easy to switch into
    Subpar stats keep it from making the best use out of its grand defensive typing
    Lack of Taunt really bites as it makes it vulnerable to the move itself and allows other Pokemon to set up hazards alongside it
    The prominence of defog doesn't guarantee that Spikes and dual screens remain on the field once Klefki is gone

Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Spikes
move 4: Foul Play / Dazzling Gleam
ability: Prankster
item: Light Clay
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD

Moves
========?

    Priority Reflect + Light Screen amplifies Klefki's and its team's bulk significantly, allowing it to set up on even certain super effective hits AND give its teammates an easier time at getting a sweep going
    Spikes can be used for further support by turning 3HKOes to 2HKOes or 2HKOes to OHKOes
    Dazzling Gleam is Klefki's most reliable STAb, while Foul Play discourages physical attackers from setting up alongside it

Set Details
========?

    Light Clay is used so that duration of Reflect + Light Screen is increased by a few more turns

Usage Tips
========?

    Generally the set works as a lead for Shell Smash teams or teams that want to give their sweepers more leg room to get going
    due to Klefki's great typing and decent bulk, it can attempt to set up dual screens multiple times throughout the match; so it's generally imprudent to sac it once it gets screens up

Team Options
========?

    This set gives more than it takes
    Belly Drum Azumarill, Tail Glow Manaphy, Shell Smash Gorebyss, Swords Dance Talonflame and many others can make great use of this support
    The only thing to watch out for is Defog users; carrying a Thundurus-I or other speedy Taunt users can be useful to make sure that Klefki's efforts don't go to waste

Utility
########
name: Utility
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Dazzling Gleam
move 3: Thunder Wave
move 4: Foul Play
ability: Prankster
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD
Moves
========

    Spikes works amazingly well with Prankster, allowing Klefki to set up multiple layers of entry hazards
    Thunder Wave works quite well as stopping speed sweepers such as Mega Lucario and Dragon Dance Charizard X should you fall into a situation where they attempt to sweep your team
    Dazzling Gleam works rather well against a slew of prominent defog users such as Lati@s and Mandibuzz
    Foul Play on the other hand gives very good coverage with Fairy-type moves and tuns the tables on fearsome physical attackers that might switch into Klefki

Set Details
========

    The EV spread with a Bold nature gives Klefki the most optimal defense stats, reaching 320 HP, 281 Defense, and 236 Special Defense; giving it slightly more special defense than a max/max defense spread would

Usage Tips
========

    This Klefki can work either as an effective lead or be saved mid-game to set up some handy spikes
    This pokemon is better used for its utility, so it's better to not mindlessly switch it into powerful attacks and force it to take on the role of a wall
    On the other hand, prankster thunder wave provides immense assurance against many set up sweepers, so if Klefki has worn out its usefulness, it can sacrafice itself at the cost of crippling the opponents sweeper

Team Options
========

    Thundurus-I is an excellent partner as it stops the likes of Deo formes and Skarmory from ruining Klefki's day
    This Pokemon pairs well with slower wall breakers that can make use of spikes and thunder wave support; Mega Garchomp and Kyurem-B greatly appreciate Kelfki's support


Other Options
########?

    SWAGPLAY
    Toxic Stall w/ torment
    Imprison to stop opposing spikes and dual screen users
    Calm Mind
    Flash Cannon
    Draining Kiss
    Switcheroo

Checks & Counters
########?

    Magic Bounce users: Xatu, Espeon, and Mega Absol
    Bulky Taunt users such as Heatran, Gliscor, and Skarmory stop it dead in its tracks
    Prankster Taunt users such as Thundurus-I and Sableye work too
    Powerful Electric-types likes Rotom-W and Magnezone can plow through it
    Powerful Ground-types such as Excadrill and Landorus can easily take it down
    Tricking Klefki or Encoring it can also make it useless, though be wary of switcheroo
    Defog in general can make Klefki's efforts go to waste
