<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This move is a rarely seen in competitive battles, because in general it is too situational to work. Even though it would be cool to send some moves back to the original user, it would require very specific situations and almost flawless predictions to actually do any good. However, one can make a case for Prankster Riolu with Copycat, Roar, and a Focus Sash as a very annoying strategy: the user first sets up entry hazards, then sends out Riolu. The Riolu uses Roar, then after forcing the opponent out, uses Copycat to repeat Roar over and over, usually going first thanks to Prankster, slowly wearing down the opponent's team. Of course, even this strategy is easily stopped by priority attacks, Regenerator, or Protect.</p>
