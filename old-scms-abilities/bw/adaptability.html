[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2> 
<p>This ability alters the wielder's STAB to be 2x instead of 1.5x.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2> 
<p>This ability is very useful on paper, but it has a very low distribution, with many of the possible users rarely being used in most tiers. <a href="/bw/pokemon/crawdaunt">Crawdaunt</a> is the most noteworthy user, and Adaptability is one of the main reasons for its viabilityâ€”Adaptability turns its relatively low-powered STAB attacks, <a href="/bw/moves/crabhammer">Crabhammer</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/crunch">Crunch</a>, into monstrous weapons, especially coming off its high base 120 Attack stat. <a href="/bw/pokemon/porygon-z">Porygon-Z</a> is the only other notable fully-evolved user of Adaptability, and is almost certainly the most powerful; however, its other ability, <a href="/bw/abilities/download">Download</a>, is usually a better choice. The only other notable Pokemon to receive Adaptability is <a href="/bw/pokemon/eevee">Eevee</a>, who can use a 204 Base Power <a href="/bw/moves/return">Return</a> in Little Cup.</p>
