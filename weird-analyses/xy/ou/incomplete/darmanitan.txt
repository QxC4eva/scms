Moves
========

    Flare Blitz is Darmanitan's most powerful STAB; along with the boost from Sheer Force, it hits everything not resistant to it hard
    Rock Slide covers Dragonite, Gyarados, and many opposing Fire-types
    Both Superpower and Earthquake hit Tyranitar and Heatran, with them hitting one over the other for more damage
    U-Turn gains momentum, scouting for switches in order to switch in a more favorable matchup; this is especially useful for a Choice wielder


Set Details
========

    An Adamant nature is preferred for this set, as Darmanitan wants as much power it can get.
    However, a Jolly nature allows Darmanitan to outspeed and revenge kill neutral-natured base 100 Speed threats at +1, such as Mega Charizard X and Salamence.


Usage Tips
========

    With a Choice Scarf, Darmanitan is great at coming in for revenge kills, KO'ing normally faster Pokemon.
    Late-game, it can potentially clean up the opponent's team once they've been significantly weakened.
    Bear in mind that if the opponent has set up Stealth Rock and or additional hazards, it may be wise to keep Darmanitan out of the fray unless it can come in on a Pokemon it can threaten, or if hazards have been removed.


Team Options
========

    A good spinner or Defogger is necessary, as Darmanitan's role as a revenge killer means that it will be switching out frequently, and Stealth Rock and recoil damage will make short work of it otherwise. Starmie, Mega Blastoise, Latias, and Scizor are adept at this and share decent synergy with Darmanitan.
    Teammates that can soften bulky Water-types for Darmanitan are appreciated, with Celebi, Kyurem-B, and Mega Venusaur being suitable.
