Deals damage at the end of the turn after three turns.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Deals damage at the end of the turn after three turns.</p>

<p>The damage is based on the Special Attack and Special Defense at the time of using Future Sight, not at the time of striking. This means that if you use Future Sight on a Pokémon with 100 Special Defense, and then your opponent switches to a Pokémon with 300 Special Defense, the damage calculations will be done as though the target has 100 Special Defense. Life Orb does not boost Future Sight's damage, nor does the user receive recoil damage.</p>

<p>Future Sight is technically typeless, so it does not get STAB, and hits all Pokémon neutrally. It hits through Wonder Guard. Because it damages at the end of the turn, it is not blocked by Detect or Protect, and can KO a Pokémon that used Endure. Focus Sash will block Future Sight. If the target uses Detect or Protect on the turn Future Sight is selected, however, that will count as a successful Detect or Protect against Future Sight.</p>

<p>Multiple Future Sights cannot be queued for the same Pokémon. Future Sight must hit the target before it can target that Pokémon again. It uses the same queue as Doom Desire, so they cannot be stacked together.</p>

<p>Future Sight cannot get a critical hit.</p>
