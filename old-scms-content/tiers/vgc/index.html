<h2>Welcome to the VGC Hub</h2>

<p>The Video Game Championships, commonly shortened to VGC, is Nintendo's official Pokemon tournament series. The VGC format is always double battles with a "bring 6, pick 4" ruleset, which means that you come prepared with a team of 6 Pokemon and pick 4 of them for each match. The 2012-2013 VGC series begins with Regionals in October, Regionals in January, and Regionals in April, and then follows with Nationals in June-July, and Worlds in August.</p>
