<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Hits 2-5 times in one turn. There is a 37.5% chance to hit either 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% chance to hit either 4 or 5 times. If a hit breaks a Substitute, the move will halt its duration.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Another of the numerous multi-hit moves. There isn't much competitive value for it all, considering the weak Base Power and low accuracy. As a matter of fact, considering the average number of hits it has an effective 45 Base Power, and no Pokemon that have access to this move have any reason whatsoever to use it. If you are looking for a Normal-type move, there are far more reliable options.</p>
