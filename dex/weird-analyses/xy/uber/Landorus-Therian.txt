Overview
########

Sporting a large base 145 Attack and great physical bulk bolstered furthered by its ability, Intimidate, Landorus-T is back and ready to terrorize those who it can in the treacherous XY Ubers metagame. Its excellent typing gives teams it's on an invaluable immunity to Ground- and Electric- type attacks. Its great typing also gives it an immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web, one of the biggest reasons to use it over the other Ground- types inhabiting the tier. Furthermore, being blessed with great offensive and supportive moves, Landorus-T is capable of running a few different viable sets. However, all is not well for this Cool Cat, it is quite frail on the special side and is pretty slow, meaning most Special Attackers in the tier either force it out or flat out OHKO it. Also, having no access to reliable recovery means that its longevity is greatly compromised. Regardless, use Landorus-T to its strengths and it won't disappoint.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Toxic / U-turn
item: Leftovers
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def
Nature: Impish

Moves
========

Earthquake is a standard STAB move for Landorus-T, and it still hits relatively hard, even without investment due to Landorus-T's high attack stat. Stealth Rock is a mandatory support move for all teams and Landorus-T is one of the better users of the move in the Ubers tier, finding many chances to set it up due to its physical bulk. Stone Edge is there to hit what Earthquake cannot, so that Pokemon with Levitate or Flying typing don't completely wall this set. However, if Stone Edge isn't doing super effective damage, it won't be doing much due to lack of STAB and Attack investment. Toxic is an excellent move for Landorus-T, allowing it to put pressure on Pokemon that otherwise like to switch in on it, such as Hippowdon, Groudon, Lugia, support Arceus, and other Landorus-T. Toxic also prevents support Arceus from being able to stay in and constantly Defog away your Stealth Rock, and in general prevents walls from having the ability to constantly recover in front of you. U-turn is another great option to consider as it provides your team with momentum, and is useful considering all the switches Landorus-T tends to cause, meaning that you can U-turn out into your own appropriate counter or check.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is pretty straight forward, with maxed out HP and Defense so that Landorus-T can do what it does best, which is check many physical attackers. Since Landorus-T has no other form of recovery, Leftovers is a must if you are using it as a defensive pivot. The remaining 4 EVs can go into Attack to make its offensive moves hit a bit harder.

Usage Tips
========

The best way to capitalize on this sets bulk is to bring it in on physical attackers or walls which can't do much to you in return, allowing Landorus-T opportune time to set up Stealth Rock, attack, or U-turn out. Landorus-T is especially good for those teams which have trouble with prominent physical attackers, but be wary of those who are capable of running Mixed Sets. Some examples of mixed attackers could be Swords Dance Ground Arceus and Mega Mewtwo-X carrying Ice Beam, and Life Orb Zekrom, all of which do a lot to Landorus-T, if not flat out OHKO it. In terms of countering Extreme Killer Arceus, despite being physically defensive it cannot actually beat a full health Extreme Killer, as Landorus-T cannot phase it out and due to good bulk, Extreme Killer can set up again. It is recommended to have another Pokemon present on your team who can deal with Extreme Killer, such as Support Arceus with Will-O-Wisp, physically defensive Yveltal and Ho-Oh, and Lugia (which can also tank special attacks).

Team Options
========

Since Landorus-T won't be tanking many special attacks, a Pokemon that can switch into special attackers is highly recommended, such as Blissey and Grass Arceus. A cleric is also very useful since Landorus-T doesn't have any form of healing itself, from either status or its HP. Having a cleric which is a Fairy type, like Sylveon and Xerenas, also gives your team dual immunity to Zekrom. Specially defensive Kyogre makes a great partner, as it can tank most special attacks and status ailments aimed at Landorus-T, and can phase as well. Water Arceus also resists Ice and Water attacks, and has good typing synergy with Landorus-T in terms of Electric- type moves. Palkia is also a good partner, as it can take Water attacks aimed at Landorus-T while also simultaneously being able to beat the physical walls that Landorus-T has trouble with otherwise.

Offensive Earth Plate
########
name: Offensive Earth Plate
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Toxic / U-turn
item: Earth Plate
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is a standard support move for the whole team. Earthquake is used to hit incredibly hard, and now hits even harder with full Attack investment and an Earth Plate, compared to more defensive versions. Stone Edge is there to hit anything that Earthquake cannot. Even given the offensive nature of this set, there are some Pokemon which it cannot break through, and that is where Toxic comes in. Toxic allows it to put pressure on a lot of those Pokemon. U-turn is also a great option which allows it to keep offensive momentum on offensive teams, which this set should be used on.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is straightforward, full investment in Attack and Speed, to let it hit hard and fast. Earth Plate is preferred on this set to boost the power of Earthquake, without the nasty recoil of Life Orb. An Adamant nature is preferred since it gives Landorus-T just a bit more power. A Jolly nature can be used as that guarantees you that Landorus-T will outspeed all base 90 Speed Pokemon not using Choice Scarf such as Kyogre, Zekrom, Dialga, and Ho-Oh. However, most of these run an Adamant or Modest nature of their own. It is still important to keep in mind that if they do run a Speed-boosting nature, they will outspeed you.

Usage Tips
========

Since this Landorus-T set aims to be more offensive than the others, don't be afraid to attack or scout with U-turn if the situation allows for it. This set is also capable of putting pressure on Mega Scizor as a Defogger, as it does approximately 50% to max HP variants. Know its limits though, as it will fail to break through Defoggers like both formes of Giratina and support Arceus without the use of Toxic, and even then, be aware that they can put offensive pressure on you before you do the same to them. This Landorus-T really hates burn more than anything, so if faced with a Pokemon that you can't both outspeed and OHKO, and it is likely that it can burn, switch out. It is also important to keep in mind that this Landorus-T does not have nearly the same bulk as the other sets, so be wary of mindlessly switching it into physical attackers, as even they can break this set down.

Team Options
========

Given the offensive nature of this set, it is best suited on offensive oriented teams. Since this set has a lot of trouble with physical walls, Pokemon which can take out these walls are recommended. Mega Gengar and, albeit a niche, Gothitelle can both come in on support Arceus and beat them, making Landorus-T's job significantly easier. Furthermore, Palkia and Xerneas make great partners as they can beat both Giratina formes, and physical walls in general. Since this Landorus-T hates status, a one time status absorber is nice to have as well, examples being Xerneas, Ho-Oh, and potentially even some Sleep Talk users. Just like with the defensive set, something that can switch into special attacks aimed at Landorus-T is good to have present on the team as well. Sylveon, Bronzong, Blissey, Aegislash, and Arceus are good examples.

Setup Sweeper
########
name: Setup Sweeper
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: Rock Polish
move 4: Swords Dance / Explosion / Hidden Power Ice
item: Life Orb
evs: 140 HP / 252 Atk / 116 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

The moveset is fairly simple; Earthquake is standard STAB, while Stone Edge allow you to hit Flying-Types, and in general Earthquake plus Stone Edge form great type synergy. Rock Polish is what makes this set work, giving it immense Speed which allows it to make use of its great Attack stat. The last move can be a bit of a toss up; Swords Dance is an excellent move which boosts Landorus-T's Attack stat even further, but may be hard to set up alongside Rock Polish. Explosion is an another amazing option, doing up to 90% on Max HP Arceus. Furthermore, Explosion prevents both a Rapid Spin and a potential Defog due to there being no target for the Pokemon to use the move on. Hidden Power Ice is mainly to be used only if you want this set to significantly damage other Landorus-T and Gliscor as otherwise this set is walled significantly by them.

Set Details
========

The Attack stat is maxed out so it can do as much damage after either boost as fast as possible, while the Speed EVs allow it to outspeed all base 100 Speed Choice Scarf users and below after a Rock Polish boost. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP to give Landorus-T some bulk. If you are using Hidden Power Ice as the final move, a Naughty nature can also be used so that Hidden Power Ice's power isn't weakened. Life Orb is the prime choice for this set as it gives a large power boost to Landorus-T, allowing it to have a large chance to OHKO common Uber Pokemon if Stealth Rocks is up, and also boosts the power of Hidden Power Ice if you choose to use it. Another item that can be considered on this set is Lum Berry. Lum Berry allows Landorus-T to set up on Pokemon that would otherwise just status it, thus allowing for more set up opportunities. One final item that can be considered if Swords Dance is used is Leftovers. While seemingly odd, Leftovers allows even this variant of Landorus-T to act as a semi-defensive pivot, while also allowing Landorus-T to set up against other Landorus-T and walls lacking Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. It is important to note that the power drop that comes with using Leftovers or Lum Berry is quite significant, and Landorus-T will lose a number of OHKOs.

Usage Tips
========

This set is generally highly outclassed by Groudon, and unless you have a very specific reason for using Landorus-T (i.e., you need a Ground immunity on your team, or for some reason Groudon's Drought interferes with your team structure) always consider Groudon for this role before Landorus-T. Groudon has better overall bulk to take on priority, and a slightly higher Attack stat as well. That being said, when using this set, it is not necessary to set up with both moves, and you should take a close look at your opponent's team before deciding on which boost to use. Set up Rock Polish against Heavy Offensive teams, and Swords Dance against bulky/stall teams. However, you will need both boosts to get past balanced teams. On another note, don't try setting up if there is a Pokemon on your opponents team that can force out Landorus-T without taking much damage themselves in the process, most notably Giratina-O, Gliscor, and other Landorus-T (unless Landorus-T carries Hidden Power Ice, in which case Gliscor an Landorus-T are significantly easier to deal with). Naturally, don't try to set up in front of something that can flat out OHKO Landorus-T. Your best bet is to set up on a Pokemon that can't hurt Landorus-T much, or something you know your opponent will switch out. This set is best used as a late-game sweeper, when all its checks and counters are gone. When you attempt your sweep, ensure that Stealth Rock is up, as it turns many 2HKOs into OHKOs.

Team Options
========

As with all other Landorus-T sets, having something that can remove physically defensive Pokemon is a must. For this set especially, it cannot sweep unless they have been removed. Palkia, Mewtwo, and Kyurem-W are all excellent options, and can decimate anything that walls Landorus-T. Mega Gengar can be used to trap support Arceus, and in general, trap anything that might be able to stop Landorus-T's sweep. Dual screen support is useful, as it allows Landorus-T to set up much easier, with Klefki and Deoxys being two usable dual screens user which can pair up with Landorus-T. Wobuffet can also help Landorus-T set up through the use of Encore and Safeguard. If you chose to run Hidden Power Ice on this set, Zekrom is an excellent partner as Landorus-T can lure common Ground types in and attempt to knock them out, paving the way for a Zekrom rampage. Lastly, since this Landorus-T doesn't carry Stealth Rock, have another Pokemon present on your team which does, a possible example being Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A on hyper offensive teams.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Superpower / Explosion
item: Choice Band
evs: 200 HP / 252 Atk / 52 Def
Nature: Adamant

Moves
========

As with other movesets, Earthquake and Stone Edge give it the EdgeQuake combo. U-turn is an excellent scouting move and a safe move to overuse if you don't know what's going to come in, it also allows you to keep up the offensive pressure. Superpower allows Landorus-T to hit Ferrothron, and guarantees a OHKO on full health Extreme Killer Arceus after Stealth Rock (and any other Arceus which is hit for super effective damage by Superpower). Explosion is the hit-all nuke button, being incredibly powerful, OHKOing Arceus at full health 62% of the time and OHKOing Gliscor switch- ins. However, be very cautious of using this move as you lose Landorus-T after using it, and be very vary of the Pokemon which remain on your opponents team; especially Steel-, Ghost-, and Rock- types. Knock Off is another really good move which allows Landorus-T to cripple some of the common switch-ins to Landorus-T by removing their item, but becomes significantly weaker afterwards.

Set Details
========

The EV Spread maximizes Attack and bulk, while at the same time ensuring that Landorus-T will never be OHKOed by a +1 Extreme Killer Arceus's Life Orb-boosted Extreme Speed after taking Stealth Rock damage.

Usage Tips
========

Given the nature of the moves of Landorus-T, be extremely careful of choosing which move you lock Landorus-T into, as two of the moves have an immunity against them, so you want to minimize the amount of free turns you give your opponent. Tread cautiously, and look at your opponents team before choosing your move. However, don't use this as an Extreme Killer Arceus check, as if Landorus-T is even a bit weakened, Extreme Killer can rip right through this, leaving you in a bad spot. In other words, don't use this Landorus-T by itself as your teams sole check to Extreme Killer Arceus. Also keep a close eye on its health through out the match if you still intend to use this to take on physical attackers.

Team Options
========

Like all other Landorus-T sets, a teammate who can remove physically defensive walls is really appreciated. Kyurem-W and Yveltal can help remove some of the defensive switch-ins to Landorus-T. Darkrai is also not a bad option, as it can deal damage to physical walls, while also providing general team support with Dark Void and Taunt. As always, a cleric is really useful, as if Landorus-T is burnt, it is essentially ruined. Since this set doesn't carry Stealth Rocks, have another Pokemon with dissimilar weaknesses as Landorus-T. Also, since you will be locked into a move that will give your opponent free turns a lot of the times, it is pivotal for your team to have a good backbone and defensive switch-ins. Water Arceus and specially defensive Kyogre are good teammates, as they can take on many special attacks aimed at Landorus-T, while Landorus-T is immune to the Electric- type moves that give those two Pokemon trouble. Blissey and Xerneas are also teammates that can work well with this Landorus-T, as they can offer both cleric support should Landrous-T get burnt, while also providing a specially defensive backbone. Having Xerneas as your cleric also gives you dual immunity to Zekrom's STAB moves.

Other Options
########

A Choice Scarf set is possible, as its 91 Base Speed allows Landorus-T to outspeed the main base 90 Choice Scarf users in the tier, like Zekrom and Kyogre, but since Landorus-T's main STAB has a lot of immunities, it is not the best choice as a Choice Scarf user. Knock Off can be used on sets other than the Choice Band set, and is a nice move to remove the opposing Pokemon's item, but Landorus-T's other moves offer far more general utility. Gravity is another move which Landorus-T can run, as it now allows Landorus-T to hit all those Pokemon who previously were immune to its Earthquake , such as Bronzong, Gliscor, and Giratina-O. One final move to be considered on Landorus-T is Substitute. Since Landorus-T tends to cause a lot of switches, it can easily set up a Substitute and act accordingly from there.

Checks & Counters
########
**Support Arceus**: Grass Arceus and Water Arceus especially, can usually come in on most attacks Landorus-T carry and recover off any damage while Defogging away its Stealth Rock. They can also burn Landorus-T with Will-O-Wisp; they hate Toxic, however.

**Both Giratina Formes**: Giratina-O is immune to Landorus-T's Ground-type moves and takes pittance from anything bar a Swords Dance-boosted Stone Edge, and can force Landorus-T out with Dragon Tail, or threaten to burn. Specially inclined versions can OHKO with Draco Meteor. Where as Giratina-A can come in on anything Landorus-T has to offer due to extreme bulk, and can Rest away all status and damage.

**Gliscor**: Unlike most other physical walls who wall Landorus-T, Gliscor doesn't even fear Toxic, and thanks to its typing takes near nothing from any attack Landorus-T offers. Gliscor can then proceed to Toxic stall Landorus-T.

**Landorus-T**: Annoys Landorus-T in the same way Landorus-T does to other physical attackers. In return though, unless it caries Toxic or Hidden Power Ice, it can't do much back to Landorus-T.

**Hippowdon**: Due to its massive physical bulk, Hipppowdon can come in on Landorus-T over and over again only fearing a potential Toxic.

**Bronzong**: Is immune to Landorus-T's main STAB move, resists Stone Edge, and is also immune to Toxic.

**Skarmory**: Is immune to Toxic, and like all the other walls, Landorus fails to do much, if anything at all to Skarmory, while it can set up Stealth Rock or phaze Landorus-T away.

**Mega-Scizor**: Physically defensive Scizor carrying Toxic can come in and poison Landorus-T, putting it on a timer. Scizor itself is also immune to the potential Toxic from Landorus-T, and can avoid a 2HKO from Earthquake. Physically defensive Scizor only fears a Swords Dance-boosted Earthquake.

**Faster Special Attacking Pokemon**: Palkia, Kyogre, Mega Mewtwo Y, regular Mewtwo, Mega Mewtwo X carrying Ice Beam, Xerneas, and the likes. While all might not be able to directly switch in, most can easily flat out OHKO Landorus-T with super effective coverage.

**Status**: Since it has no reliable recovery, and is a physical attacker, both Toxic and burn are real nuisances for it.
