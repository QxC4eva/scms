Moves
========

    Stealth Rock- indispensable hazard
    Slack Off is used for instant recovery
    Whirlwind for phazing set-up sweepers or just shuffling for hazards damage
    Toxic for annoying the shit out of anything not immune to it
    Earthquake so it's not completely taunt bait and can hit mgar, do some chip damage, etc.



Set Details
========

    Leftovers for longevity
    Max Hp max defense impish to tank physical hits like a boss
    Can check pretty much any physical booster
    Annoying as fuck


Usage Tips
========

    Don't switch it into special attackers (duh) hippo ain't tanking no spacial rend
    Ho-oh burns suck balls :( just slack off more in that case
    Zeke can carry Dmeteor, so beware of that
    Slack off frequently, Hippo will still be 3HKO'ed (almost 2hko'ed) by strong physical attacks
    Surprise toxics suck ass balls


Team Options
========

    clerics (chansey, blissey, xerneas)Xerneas also shuts down zekrom really well alingside hippo
    strong special sponges (again chansey, aegislash)
    ogre check (palkia, av amoong, av slowking)
    grass types are cool
    ice resist, ie. ogre, etc
    bulky waters pair well with hippo, as it checks krom 4 them
    Refresh Cm Waterceus likes hippo checking krom
    Spdef ogre acts as a sort of status absorber
    Frrro can provide a nice water resist and a hazards Jcore


Other Options
########

I guess you could use CB Hippo, which hits surprisingly hard lol. Beware of burns if you do though .-. Ice Fang could be used to hit Gliscor, Stone Edge hits ho-oh and yawn could be used. Hippo has a dearth of viable options

Checks & Counters
