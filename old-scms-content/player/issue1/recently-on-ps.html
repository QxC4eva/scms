    <h4>Tournaments updates, triples formats and suspect test</h4>
    <p class="publication-info">By <a href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/members/detective-dell.135483/">Detective Dell</a> on July 18, 2014</p>
    <p>Our tournament script has gotten better, so the <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/tournaments">Tournaments room</a> is now our second Official Room! It's a fun alternative to the ladder, and supports several formats like Round Robin, Single Elimination and Double Elimination. We've worked hard to get here, so you should give it a try!</p>

    <p>We also have some new XY Triples formats: Random Battle and Pikachu Tournamentchu on the ladder, and some others off! Pikachu Tournamentchu is a format where you must use Pikachu and any Pok&eacute;mon that's not fully evolved.</p>

    <p>We have some suspect tests! <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/np-xy-ou-suspect-testing-round-5-ghost-of-perdition.3511596/">OU is testing Aegislash</a> (2700 COIL to vote). The test ends on Saturday, July 26th. <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/metagame-discussion-thread-current-topic-what-to-nominate-post-188.3505710/page-8#post-5600532">LC is has a discussion-based suspect</a> (1950 COIL to vote), ending on Friday, July 25th. Good luck, everyone!</p>

    <h4>The Player &amp; Social Media room launch</h4>
    <p class="publication-info">By <a href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/members/scene.191866/">Scene</a> on July 10, 2014</p>
    <p>We've launched a PS webzine! Named <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/forums/the-player.307/">The Player</a>, it's a source for articles written by the community related to all aspects of PS. Read <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/introducing-the-player.3509888/">the introductory thread</a> first, and if you're interested in writing for us check out the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/open-submitting-an-article-read-here-first.3509907/">article submission guide</a> and <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/contributing-guidelines.3509892/">contributor guidelines</a> (they don't take too long to read, and are well worth doing so). If you've got a brief question you'd like to ask, our <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/have-a-question-ask-it-here-the-player-edition.3509871/">SQSA thread</a> should cover you there. We've had a fantastic response already in terms of articles and art, and expect to release our first issue in late July. We'd love to have you as a contributor too!</p>

    <p>To tie in with the release of The Player, the Youtube room has been renamed <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/socialmedia">Social Media</a>! It's still the same room and still retains a focus on Youtube, but it's had a rename in order to emphasize that other social media sites like Facebook, Twitch and Twitter are very welcome as discussion topics in the room.</p>

    <p>The Doubles room has a new event: the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/3510485/">Ladder Tournament Challenge</a>! To participate, simply create an alt that starts with the letters "LT" and battle on the Smogon Doubles ladder. Be sure to read the thread for full rules and instructions!</p>

    <p>Several suspect tests are currently in progress! OU is <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/3509824">testing Deoxys-Defense and Deoxys-Speed</a> until Monday, July 7th. It's not too late to participate! Achieve a COIL of 2700 on the OU (suspect test) ladder for a chance to vote. RU is having a <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/3510066/">test of Shuckle</a> that is also ending Monday, July 7th. To be eligible for voting, players are required to achieve a COIL of 2400 on the RU (suspect test) ladder.</p>
