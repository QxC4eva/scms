<p>Welcome to the Smogon Frontier, the ultimate challenge for aspiring competitive battlers! This is your opportunity to prove your talent by taking on some of the top competitive battlers in the game that have been designated Smogon Frontier Brains. The goal is simple: defeat 12 Frontier Brains and enter the Smogon Frontier Hall of Fame! The Smogon Frontier will be accepting challenges for 30 days, but registration closes 15 days after it opens. Be sure to take note of the rules and regulations in the <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3469913">registration thread</a>.</p>

<p>The prized green trophy has returned to its case. Will it be yours this year? Can you battle your way through twelve of Smogon's finest OU players? Last season, Smogon administrator Bloo aka "Blooser" made the leap from ladder noob to ladder noob with a trophy after defeating his twelve fellow brains. Will you be the next one to join him, or will you just be another of reyscarface's one hundred victims? Assemble your teams, prepare your scouting reports, and stock up on your Hyper Potions: you're going to need it.</p>
