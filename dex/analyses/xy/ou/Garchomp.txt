Overview
########

Ever since its advent in the DPP era, Garchomp has been a force to be reckoned with in the OU metagame. With a complementary STAB combination, excellent offensive stats, and ability to take on a wide array of roles, Garchomp makes for a key offensive threat. On top of its ability to take on many roles such as a mixed wallbreaker or a revenge killer, Garchomp also has quite respectable bulk for an offensive Pokemon, while simultaneously hitting a crucial Speed tier of 102, giving it the ability to outspeed threats such as Charizard and Landorus. All of these attributes allow Garchomp to be devastatingly tricky Pokemon to play around, and constitute the factors that make it so versatile. Moreover, the shift to XY also granted Garchomp with a Mega Evolution, an alternate forme which augments its offensive stats to ridiculous heights in sacrifice for Speed, reawakening its artifactual ChainChomp set. Apart from Garchompite, Garchomp can also utilize a diverse range of other items in its sets, adding to its distinguished flexibility.

However, the phrase "Jack of all trades, master of none" couldn't be more applicable to our fearsome friend. Garchomp, while quite versatile, cannot pull off all of its sets at once, meaning that it will always be lefting wanting a little bit more. Its Stealth Rock set lacks the immediate power, its Mixed set the Speed, and its Tank set the longevity. Additionally, Garchomp is plagued with a pesky x4 weakness to Ice, leaving it vulnerable to many revenge killers such as Thundurus and Deoxys-S.

Offensive Stealth Rock
########
name: Offensive Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 4: Fire Blast / Swords Dance
ability: Rough Skin
item: Rocky Helmet / Lum Berry
nature: Naive / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

This set takes advantage of Garchomp's handy ability to force switches by incorporating Stealth Rock. A staple of almost every single team, Stealth Rock provides invaluable support and Garchomp is on of the few good offensive Pokemon that can learn it. Earthquake and Outrage act as Garchomp's main two STAB attacks, with Earthquake giving it the ability to deal with Heatran and Aegislash, while Outrage rounds off the coverage, hitting Flying-types and Levitators immune to Ground. Dragon Claw can potentially replace Earthquake if getting locked into Outrage is undesirable, but lacks the power that Outrage boasts. Fire Blast is an excellent choice to hit the likes of Ferrothorn and Skarmory for a lot more damage, opening holes for setup sweepers later in the game and halting opposing entry hazard setters. Alternatively, Swords Dance can be used to make Garchomp an immediate threat to the opposing team and grants it a role outside of setting Stealth Rock.


Set Details
========

The EVs are fairly straightforward, prioritizing Garchomp's Speed and Attack so that it can be as fast as possible while the rest of the EVs are placed into Attack to escalate the power of Earthquake and Outrage. A Rocky Helmet works well in conjunction with Rough Skin to punish opponents that make contact with Garchomp, such as Scizor and Tyranitar. However, a Lum Berry can also be used to give Garchomp a one-time cure against status. In particular, it heals a single burn from the likes of Rotom-W or a self-induced confusion from Outrage. Another item that could be used is a Focus Sash, which ensures that Garchomp can get Stealth Rock up and helps it when leading. In the case that one opts to run Swords Dance over Fire Blast, a Jolly nature is preferred as Garchomp no longer needs Special Attack.

Usage Tips
========

Unlike the Swords Dance set, this particular Garchomp is best used in the early game in order to get Stealth Rock on the field as soon as possible. As such, it is very common for this set to be used as a lead, but it doesn't necessarily need to be used as such. Garchomp should ideally set up Stealth Rock on Pokemon that can't immediately threaten it or will generally switch out, such as Heatran and Excadrill. [more stuff to go here]

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate the presence of Stealth Rock are generally good partners. Examples of this include Talonflame and Mega Pinsir, two Pokemon which can take advantage of Stealth Rock to secure KOs and sweep weakened teams. These Pokemon also appreciate Garchomp's ability to fracture defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory or Hippowdon, depending on its set. In a similar vein, powerful wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Mega Charizard Y pair well with Garchomp to dismantle defensive Pokemon. Garchomp also resists Rock, which both of these Pokemon are weak too.

In order to keep Stealth Rock up, having a Ghost-type teammate to block Rapid Spin can be a great idea. Aegislash or Gengar fit this role capably, with the former resisting two of Garchomp's weaknesses: Ice and Fairy. Bisharp is also another team option to consider, as it can exploit the evasion drop from Defog used to remove Garchomp's Stealth Rock in order to trigger an Attack boost through Defiant.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 4: Stone Edge / Fire Fang
ability: Rough Skin
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Swords Dance allows Garchomp to sweep teams when it gets a chance to set up.
- Earthquake is its main STAB move and primary attack. Ground-type coverage works well alongside Dragon-type moves to hit most Fairies and Steel-types.
- Outrage is the secondary STAB. It hits Pokemon that are immune/resistant to EQ (such as Rotom-W, Gyarados, and Landorus-T) as well as having a higher Base Power.
- Fire Fang is for coverage against other Steel-types. In particular, it hits Skarmory and Ferrothorn for a hefty chunk of damage.
- Stone Edge is an option over Fire Fang. It allows Garchomp to hit Togekiss, which otherwise walls it. It also hits KOs Charizard regardless of which mega evolution it uses.
- Substitute is another option. It can work in the last slot as a way of both blocking status and gives safety against faster threats at the cost of losing coverage.

Set Details
========
- Lum Berry gives Garchomp the ability to set up without having to worry about status moves such as Will-O-Wisp. It can also recover confusion caused by Outrage.
- Life Orb makes Garchomp's attacks hit with a bit of extra power, securing extra KOs.
- Leftovers and Salac Berry are useful if Substitute is used in the last slot.
- Yache Berry helps Garchomp shield itself from potential revenge kills or may aid it in setting up.
- Garchompite can be used on sandstorm teams for a massive power boost. It allows Garchomp to easily run through defensive teams.
- EVs give maximum Speed and Attack. This is mandatory for a physical set up sweeper and makes sure that Garchomp outpaces all non-boosted Pokemon with 101 or below base Speed (e.g. Jirachi, Kyurem-B, Lucario, Thundurus-T).
- Leftovers can be used if you choose to go with Substitute.

Usage Tips
========
- It is best to save Garchomp for the mid-late game so that its main checks and counters have already been dealt with or weakened enough so that Garchomp can finish them off.
- Swords Dance is best used on a predicted switch when Garchomp forces something out, or when the Pokemon it is facing can do little to prevent a sweep.
- Setting up a Swords Dance is a lot easier if you have a Lum Berry as it can be done on Pokemon that rely on status to stop you. However, this doesn't mean you should directly switch into users of status moves.
- Be wary of using Outrage if there is still a Fairy-type on the opponent's team, as you could potentially be giving them a free turn if you use Outrage too early.

Team Options
========
- Thundurus-I makes a good partner because it can deal with Skarmory very easily, and also can utilize Prankster Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats for Garchomp to sweep through such as Latios, Keldeo, and Infernape.
- Aegislash's mixed set is a good wallbreaking partner to this set. It can beat Latios, Rotom-W, and maim Landorus-T on the switch.
- Offensive Heatran can deal with Swords Dance Mega Mawile with Will-O-Wisp, can lay down Stealth Rock, and can threaten Ferrothorn and opposing switch-ins with Fire Blast
- If you want to use this set with Garchompite, using a Smooth Rock Tyranitar is highly advised to maximize the effects of Sand Force.

Mixed
########
name: Mixed
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Draco Meteor
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Stone Edge
ability: Rough Skin
item: Garchompite
nature: Naughty
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Earthquake gets a nice attack boost with Sand Force, and hits extremely hard with Mega Garchomp's boosted offenses. It is Garchomp's main attack.
- Draco Meteor is used to hit common switch-ins such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon, putting them into a range where they can be quickly finished off.
- Fire Blast takes advantage of Mega Garchomp's mixed capabilities, being able to hit Skarmory and Ferrothorn much harder than usual.
- Stone Edge completes Mega Garchomp's coverage, allowing it to hit Togekiss. Stone Edge also gets a boost from Sand Force and can be used to hit Rotom-W and Landorus without having Special Attack dropped.

Set Details
========
- Max Speed is used so that Garchomp can still threaten Pokemon with its Speed before mega evolution. This includes Pokemon such as Bisharp, Mega Charizard X, and Kyurem-B.
- Because its Attack stat is already high enough, the rest of the EVs are placed into Garchomp's Special Attack to make Draco Meteor hit as hard as possible.
- Lonely increases Garchomp's main offensive stat. Special Defense isn't needed as Garchomp typically won't need to switch into special attackers.
- Rash heightens Special Attack while lowering its less useful defensive stat, Special Defense.
- Garchompite is used because its offensive stats are much higher in this forme.

Usage Tips
========
- This Garchomp set shines at breaking down defensive cores, so it is best used in the early-mid game.
- It is not always necessary to mega evolve Garchomp instantly, as the Speed boost while in normal form can help it outrun certain threats.
- It should not attempt to sweep, but rather dismantle defensive Pokemon so that holes can be opened up for a teammate.
- Mixed Garchomp should not attempt to stay in for prolonged periods of time as it is a lot easier to revenge kill. Hit-and-run tactics are usually the most efficient.

Team Options
========

- Sand support is highly recommended. As a result, Smooth Rock Tyranitar or Hippowdon are excellent partners as they activate Sand Force.
- Choice Band Azumarill is also a good teammate as it benefits off of Garchomp's wall-breaking abilities and has Aqua Jet to finish up late game
- Sweepers that appreciate having their checks and counters worn down are good teammates. - Swords Dance Talonflame appreciates Rotom-W and Landorus-T being KOed, so they have good compatibility.
- Sand Rush Excadrill helps clean up in Sandstorm and can use Rapid Spin to keep hazards off of the field.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Rock Slide / Stone Edge
move 4: Fire Blast / Dragon Claw
ability: Rough Skin
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Naive / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Outrage is Garchomp's strongest move with a Choice Scarf. It should be used when the power is necessary.
- Earthquake is Garchomp's secondary move and allows it to hit Steel- and Fairy-types which don't mind Outrage.
- Rock Slide and Stone Edge are interchangeable moves for revenge killing certain threats such as Volcarona and Charizard. It also allows Garchomp to hit Togekiss and Mandibuzz super effectively.
- Dragon Claw can be used to give Garchomp a Dragon-type STAB without getting locked into Outrage. Fire Blast is used to hit Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which don't mind Garchomp's other moves.
- Dual Chop is another option. It allows Garchomp to break through Substitutes when revenge killing.

Set Details
========
- This Garchomp set employs a Choice Scarf to maximize its revenge killing potential. It can also be used to finish off weakened threats in the end game.
- A Jolly nature maximizes Speed so Garchomp can outpace as many Pokemon as possible (such as +1 Timid Volcarona). Naive should be used over Jolly if Garchomp chooses to go with Fire Blast.
- Max Attack and Speed are used for obvious reasons (as much power as possible).

Usage Tips
========
- This Garchomp set acts primarily as a revenge killer and cleaner, taking advantage of the speed boost provided by the Choice Scarf to finish off weakened threats.
- It is best to preserve Garchomp as a safety net to boosted threats and not use it recklessly.
- This set lacks the power possessed by its Swords Dance set. As such, Choice Scarf Garchomp shouldn't be used to wall-break or to attack healthy, bulky foes.
- It is best not to use Outrage if the opponent has Pokemon that can abuse a locked-in Garchomp (namely Fairies or Steel-types), but mainly to clean in the end-game.
- Fire Blast should be used on a predicted switch into Skarmory or Ferrothorn in order to maximize damage on them.

Team Options
========
- Magnezone can be used to trap and KO troublesome Steel-types so that Garchomp has an easier time cleaning in the end game.
- Dugtrio can also be used in a similar manner to Magnezone (to get rid of Steels)
- Due to the low damage output of Choice Scarf Garchomp compared to its other sets, it may be a good idea to run other powerful Dragon-types along such it. Examples of this include Kyurem-B or Latios, which can weaken or remove Garchomp's checks and counters.
- Choice Scarf Garchomp is best used as a glue for offensive and balanced teams, functioning as a good revenge killer and a good late-game cleaner at the same time.

Tank
########
name: Tank
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Dragon Tail
move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: Toxic / Fire Blast
ability: Rough Skin
item: Rocky Helmet
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

Moves
========
- Earthquake provides Garchomp a form of damage output. It also helps Garchomp deal with Heatran and Aegislash in particular.
- Dragon Tail lets Garchomp phaze opponents and rack up Stealth Rock damage. It also stops opponents from setting up successfully.
- Stealth Rock is a near-mandatory move on every team. Garchomp can exploit the forces it causes to set it up easily. It also works well in tandem with Dragon Tail.
- If the team already has a Stealth Rock user, then Garchomp can run a different move in this slot (Toxic if Fire Blast is used, Fire Blast if Toxic is used).
- Rest and Sleep Talk in 3rd and 4th slots are other options. Rest Talk gives Garchomp a means of restoring its HP outside of relying on Wish support.
- Stone Edge is a possible coverage move and allows Garchomp OHKO Charizard-Y, Talonflame, Volcarona, and Pinsir. It can replace Stealth Rock or Toxic.

Set Details
========
- A Rocky Helmet stacks with Rough Skin to punish physical attackers, causing opponents to lose 2/8 of their total HP every time they make contact.
- The EV spread and nature provide for maximum physical bulk.
- A Lax or Relaxed nature could also be used if you do not want to hinder Fire Blast's damage output.
- Leftovers is another good option. This gives Garchomp a way of healing its health passively, but sacrifices its utility in the passive damage provided by a Rocky Helmet.
- An EV spread of 252 HP / 196 Def / 60 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used so that Garchomp can outspeed Adamant Lucario and max Speed Heatran.

Usage Tips
========
- This Garchomp set out is best brought out to punish physical attackers that make contact. As such, bringing it into attacks such as Scizor's U-turn or Pinsir's Quick Attack is generally a good idea.
- Do not get cocky with Garchomp's ability to take hits. It relies in either the shaky RestTalk to a teammate's Wish in order to heal itself back up, and it is by no means a defensive juggernaut compared to other Pokemon in OU.
- It can be brought out at virtually any point of the game. However, it is a good idea to get up Stealth Rock as soon as possible when appropriate to do so (e.g. when opponent has a Volcarona or Dragonite).


Team Options
========
- Chansey handles any special attacker that threatens Garchomp and can pass him Wishes. Garchomp reciprocates this support by punishing physical attackers with its Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet combination.
- Heatran resists all of Garchomp's weaknesses and can handle Special Attackers as well. It can phaze Pokemon that attempt to set up with Roar.
- Pokemon that are weak to U-turn appreciate having Garchomp as a teammate to deal passive damage to them. Examples of this include Starmie and Deoxys-S.

Other Options
########

Outside of the listed sets, Garchomp has a few other options. In particular, one could opt to give it a Choice Band for instant offensive power and wallbreaking capabilities. However, its mixed set generally outshines such a set in the wallbreaking department, and it would provide far too many setup opportunities. Other options in Garchomp's physical movepool include Aqua Tail, Iron Head, and Poison Jab. Aqua Tail could be used to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon for extra damage, whereas the latter two have use in hitting Fairy-type Pokemon such as Togekiss and Clefable harder. However, these moves usually provide assistance better served through teammates, and limit Garchomp's options for the rest of its moveslots.

A set comprised of a Salac Berry and Substitute could work, giving Garchomp a way to boost its Speed when sweeping, which it cannot otherwise do. This grants Garchomp the ability to outspeed the large majority of the unboosted metagame and aids the Speed issues of its Swords Dance set. That being said, the omnipresence of priority moves limits this set's potential as Pokemon such as Azumarill and Scizor would easily be able to revenge kill a weakened Garchomp.

A Yache Berry or Roseli Berry are possible item choices for offensive Garchomp sets, giving it a way to shield against revenge killing attempts from Ice- and Fairy-type attacks, respectively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physical Walls**: Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Bronzong, Gliscor, Landorus-T, Quagsire.
Hippowdon, and Donphan, though many of these Pokemon have trouble with the Mixed set.

**Revenge Killers**: Weavile, Mamoswine, Starmie, Thundurus-I, Latios, Keldeo, and Greninja.

**Fairy-types**: Clefable, Azumarill, Togekiss, Sylveon, though they have trouble with the mixed set.

**Status**: Garchomp's longevity is hindered by Toxic and its power by being burnt. Rotom-W can burn it with Will-O-Wisp and Mandibuzz can poison it with Toxic.
