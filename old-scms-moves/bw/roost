Heals 50% HP. Temporarily removes the user's Flying typing.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals the user by 1/2 of its maximum HP, rounded half up. For the duration of the turn Roost is used in, the user loses its Flying typing, thus less susceptible to Electric-, Ice-, and Rock-type attacks and more susceptible to Bug-, Fighting-, Ground-, and Grass-type attacks. If a pure Flying-type uses Roost, it becomes Normal-type for the remainder of the turn. This does not apply to non-Flying-types who use Roost, and Pokemon with Levitate who use Roost do not forfeit their Ground immunities. Does nothing if the user's HP is full.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Roost is a great competitive addition to any Pokemon's movepool. The ability to instantly recover 50% of the user's HP is always an amazing ability to have in compatible battling, and allows many walls, such as Skarmory, Lugia, and many others, to easily keep themselves alive. Roost's secondary effect, negating the user's Flying typing, is a mixed bag dependent on a few things. For example, if Skarmory is against a Conkeldurr, using Roost would make Skarmory weak to Drain Punch, and a player should be wary of using Roost over Brave Bird or Taunt in that scenario. On the other hand, if a fast wall like Lugia is against a bulky Zekrom, Roost can be used to allow Lugia to survive the incoming Bolt Strike.</p>
