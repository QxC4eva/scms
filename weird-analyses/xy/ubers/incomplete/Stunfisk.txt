Overview
########

-Reasonable physical bulk and good special bulk by Ubers standards
-Can check dangerous threats such as Electric Arceus and Zekrom while reliably setting up Stealth Rock
-Toxic pressures Defog Arceus, while Arceus formes struggle to do significant damage back (except Water and Grass)
-Very limited offenses by Ubers standards, base 81 Special Attack is not good
-Unique but mediocre defensive typing
-Downright awful Speed and no reliable recovery hurt it

Moves
========

-Stealth Rock is Stunfisk's best move and it reliably sets rocks up on common Pokemon such as Dialga, Support Arceus, and Tyranitar
-Toxic cripples Arceus and discourages Pokemon like Kyogre from freely switching in
-Earth Power allows Stunfisk to beat most Dialga 1-1 while providing reliable STAB; it goes well with Toxic since it hits Steel-and-Poison types supereffectively
-Thunder is an alternative option with bad accuracy but a sexy 30% paralysis rate; it also beats Defog Skarmory and dents Scizor harder
-Last slot usually goes to Protect to rack up Toxic damage and help scout, but running both Earth Power and Thunder is viable
-Thunder Wave can be used over Toxic to cripple Geomancy Xerneas and punish faster Pokemon, but Stunfisk generally prefers putting Pokemon on a timer...it also allows Stunfisk to check the dangerous Electric Arceus
-Discharge is another STAB option with a nice para rate, but it's weak
-Yawn forces switches, but isn't as good this generation since hazards are no longer dominant
-Rest is very viable on this, especially with cleric support...Stunfisk can find some free turns to wake up

Set Details
========

-Specially Defensive is its best set and allows Stunfisk to check CM Arceus formes
-Physically Defensive or mixed spread can help check Zekrom better
-Leftovers is mandatory on Specially Defensive; Rocky Helmet mention on Physically Defensive?
-Static is cool and can screw over mons like Mega Mewtwo X and Genesect

Usage Tips
========

-Stunfisk's usefulness will vary by matchup. If you see a Zekrom, Dialga, or Deoxys-A on your opponent's team, play Stunfisk a little more conservatively so it can support your team by checking these threats. If not, there's nothing wrong with bring aggressive and getting up Rocks ASAP; Stunfisk beats common Defog Arceus such as Rock, Ghost, Fairy, and Grass Knot Grass Arceus so keep that in mind
-Stunfisk can status Power Herb Xerneas so long it is at or near full health; however, it can only cripple Xerneas, not beat it 1-1. Therefore, do not rely on Stunfisk as a check to this
-Stunfisk finds ample opportunities to come in, but cannot do too much to the opponent apart from status and set up SR. Avoid keeping Stunfisk in for too long as you may give your opponent too many free turns
-In an emergency, Static can stop a Mega Mewtwo X/Dragon Dance Rayquaza sweep...however, NEVER rely on Static hax as it will naturally fail to activate more often than not

Team Options
========

-Palkia, Gastrodon, and Grass Arceus help deal with Kyogre; Gastrodon also beats Palkia lacking Choice Specs
-Gliscor provides a status absorber and a check to Groudon all in one
-Partners that can beat Defog Arceus-Water and Arceus-Grass are helpful. Electric Arceus and Dialga deal with the former whereas Ho-Oh and Heatran can crush the latter
-Skarmory deals with EKiller and Ground Arceus while providing an Earthquake immunity
-Xerneas and Fairy Arceus ensure your team has immunities to both of Zekrom's STAB moves

Other Options
########

-Thunderbolt is worse than Arceus-Bug
-Foul Play does good damage to Mega Mewtwo Y
-Eerie Impulse can ruin Geomancy Xerneas and potentially give a teammate an opportunity to set up if your opponent does not switch out
