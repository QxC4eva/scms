<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Note: This team was built by mostwanted and AndViet, and the RMT features commentary by both mostwanted and Howard. mostwanted's comments will be in standard text, while Howard's will be in <em>italics</em>.

<p><em>All right, so. MostWanted asked me to come on as an advisory role to the team building and RMT process, and I was more than happy to do so. This is a Hyper Offensive team with a Deoxys-S lead, which is becoming more and more of a standard in today’s metagame. If 3 layers of spikes and 1 layer of Stealth Rocks are set up, the game is pretty much won. The sweepers chosen complement each other extremely well and there are few teams that can stand in their way without getting completely demolished in the process.</em></p>

<p>Hello Smogon, I haven’t made a Rate My Team for awhile now, this team has been giving me great success so I wanted to share this with you guys. I’ve peaked #1 with this team on the OU Ladder with 1608 points. This team was made by me and AndViet modified it during the round 54 of Battling 101. This is a somewhat Standard HO team but there is a twist to it. I’ve been trying to post this RMT for almost 4 weeks now, but due to my tight schedule I didn’t had much time. I’ve seen so many players copying my team from the ladder and modifying it as theirs. Anyways, lets get started with a further adieu.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/389.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Deoxys-S</strong> @ Rocky Helmet<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Magic Coat</p>

<p><em>So this is new Deoxys set, that I think is one of the most creative sets in the Metagame. Magic Coat allows Deoxys to beat other Deoxys leads by preventing Taunt, still outspeeding just about everything imaginable and being able to Taunt them, and also the ability to set up rocks and spikes, as any normal Deoxys lead would be able to do. Defense and Hit Points are maximized to help Deoxys take hits, especially from priority users, and Rocky Helmet provides easy residual damage for Bullet Punchers and Extremespeed users attempting to stop Deoxys from setting up hazards. The benefit of breaking Multiscale cannot be overstated, and this helps in the process. A standard HO lead, with a non-standard, but incredibly effective, set.</em></p>

<p>Deoxys-S has many appealing factors which always makes it an effective lead in HO. Like I mentioned earlier Deoxys-S was chosen instead of Espeon because of its versatile move pool. The main role for this poke is to set as many hazards as fast as possible and taunting opponents hazard users carefully. Rocky Helmet is there to get free damage on the physical attackers who think they can handle Deoxys-S by all means. The Evs are pretty straight forward, they’re there to maximize Deoxys-S survivability and yet out speeding tons of shit. I've been testing Magic Coat on this guy a lot and it worked like a miracle. Against other Deoxys-S leads I just Magic Coat and then Taunt them, after that I proceed to set my own hazards up. Rocky Helmet + the timid nature helps a shit load against attackers who think they can KO Deoxys-S, it an another surprise factor in this team. In most of my matches I usually lead off with this guy setting up my hazards then wrecking opponent’s team with my powerful sweepers.</p>

<p><strong>Gengar</strong> @ Black Sludge<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe <br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- Disable<br />
- Substitute</p>

<p><em>A Mon that has been called the “Torment Tran” of the 5th generation, this particular Gengar set can absolutely demolish stall teams and banded foes with relative ease from behind a sub. Gengar can break Tyranitar/Ferrothorn/Jellicent cores and stop many other foes with prejudice. It can deal huge damage to Lati@s and Reuniclus, and pretty much anything that tries to switch into it. Its coverage is unresisted. The EV’s here are pretty straightforward. Maximize your best stats for optimum carnage.</em></p>

<p>Gengar has been such an awesome poke, it becomes better and better in every gen. One of the main role for this poke is to block spinners. Mons with foresight are a huge threat but its good that they’re rare. The evs are standard Timid Max Speed to out speed common threats to this team. Max Special Attack is there to boost Gengar’s Stabs and shit. Black Sludge over Life Orb for stalling and Recovery purposes. Disable was chosen to deal with annoying set upers like Gliscor, Conkeldurr, etc. It can also be used to disable Blissey’s recovery move who occasionally switch into Gengar thinking they can out stall him. Shadow Ball is there for stab. Substitute is there to work well with Disable. It can also scout sets and block statuses. Focus Blast is there to hit pokes who resist Shadow Ball. Lately, I’ve been thinking Focus Blast for Taunt. Then Gengar can Block the spinners and also stop them from setting up their hazards. By this Gengar can make Dragonite’s sweep much faster and better.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-W</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Trick<br />
- Volt Switch<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p><em>This is my favorite Pokemon in the metagame. Period. Trick can completely cripple a whole team with just one move. Keeping the scarf allows you to HP Ice threats such as Dragonite, while still outspeeding at +1, allowing you to break Multiscale, and KO on the next turn. The other 2 moves abuse Rotom-W’s STAB to the fullest, with Volt Switch allowing you switch unscathed to counter, and Hydro Pump to do serious damage, even outside of Rain. I have one many a game with seemingly just Rotom-W, and it is incredibly difficult to counter. The EV’s here are (you guessed it!) maximum Speed and Special Attack to give speed ties and outspeed everything you need to. A true champion of the metagame, and one of the best monsters you could ask for.</em></p>

<p>Rotom-W is simply an amazing poke. It typing, ability and sets are outstanding. The first main role for this poke is to work efficiently with Gengar. As Gengar switches into Spinners, I can double switch into Rotom-W and Volt Switch out and switch into Gengar and continue this process against the spinner which Gengar was tough time against. Rotom-W is also there to cripple bitches with Trick, cough Blissey, Chansey. The Evs are again Standard on this guy. Modest to hit hard, Max Special Attack for massive power, Max Speed to also play a role as a Choice Scarfer. The set is self explainable as well. Hydro Pump is there for stab, Volt Switch is for scouting purposes, Hidden Power Ice is to fuck up Dragons like Dragonite, Salamence, etc. Lastly Trick is rarely used but it’s a good option to cripple annoying walls. Overall, Rotom-W plays a key role and supports the sweepers very good.</p>

<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Iron Plate<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 96 Atk / 160 SpD<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- Roost</p>

<p><em>Scizor is one of the most useful mons in the metagame right now. Her natural bulk and STAB priority make him one of the best revenge killers in the game. She also has an air of unpredictability, because of his common Choice Band usage. This set is somewhat unpredictable, as most people expect some form of band variant with Scizor nowadays. Swords Dance on the switch, and power through the opponent with STAB/Technician boosted attacks. Roost off damage like a champ, and rinse, wash, repeat. The EV’s give Scizor some bulk, while still allowing her to damage foes from the get go. One of the MVP’s of the team.</em></p>

<p>Scizor is another outstanding poke which serves a key role in this team. This poke has the ability to set up on so many pokes that it’s insane. It can easily set up and proceed to tear apart a team with its stab Technician Bullet Punch and unpredictable U-Turn. The HP and Special Defensive Evs on this poke are to take Special Hits like a boss, with Adamant Nature and 96 Attack it can get an easy boost and reach 700 with Swords Dance. Iron plate is there to get BP boosted which is very essential in killing top threats like Terrakion. Bullet Punch is there for Stab and to nail Terrakion in the fuckin face. U-Turn was suggested by MDragon and I was surprised how effectively it worked. This poke was chosen over Lucario because it takes Hits better than him. Trick Room Reuniclus completely rapes this team, so Scizor was added cause of that too. Its amazing Priority is mind blowing. I’ve been thinking for replacing Roost for Brick Break but I don’t know yet. Brick Break can help a lot while facing a team with Screens and it can damage Skarmory which is good.</p>

<p><strong>Terrakion</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Justified<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- X-Scissor<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p><em>This monster right here is the bane of a lot of teams existence. CB Close Combat has incredibly power, being able to 2HKO Skarmory, which is no easy feat to say the least. With almost no safe switch ins in the metagame, Terrakion can tear some serious holes in an opponent’s team. Quick attack allows for priority to pick off weakened opponents, with the rest of the moves there for coverage and sheer power. The 4 SDef EV’s give Terrakion some extra bulk to abuse Sandstorm, due to the 50% increase. The rest (as usual) are put into Attack and Speed.</em></p>

<p>Terrakion is a killer. It has to be the best banded poke ever created. Its sheer power is devastating. Terrakion can literally shit on an entire team if played correctly. Its main role is to beat Sun, Sand, and Volcarona which are huge threats to this HO team. The Evs on this poke are pretty straight forward, Max Speed to outspeed Jirachi and shit, Max attack with Band to shit on Skarmory and so many other scrubs. 4 Sp Def Evs comes in handy while facing Sand. Close Combat is the most used move on this poke and it shits every time. Stone Edge is for Gliscors which resist CC and take a shit load again with dual Stab SE. I had Rock Slide over Earthquake but due to Toxicroak and misses I changed it. X-Scissors is to hit the Psychic types better. This is my favorite poke on this team. Its raw power is so good and it supports the team really well.</p>

<p><strong>Dragonite</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Multiscale<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Fire Punch<br />
- Extremespeed</p>

<p><em>This Dragonite set is one of the most broken in the metagame right now. With even a little bit of prediction, this behemoth can come in, dance up at will without fear of status and sweep unprepared teams so fast they usually rage quit upon seeing the fact they stand no chance. The best is Dragon Dancing in a clear status situation, taking a Thunder Wave/Toxic/ Will-O-Wisp and laughing as you get a free boost. Great coverage in its move-pool coupled with Multiscale makes this one of the most fearsome sweepers you can come across. The EV’s are what you would expect from a boosting sweeper. Maximized attack and speed (which is becoming a trend in this RMT) to make sure no one can stand in the way of your destruction.</em></p>

<p>The Second Most Valuable Player of the team in the house bitches. No Joke but this poke is broken as fuck, it sets up so easily against mons and fucks shit up. This pokes primary job is to beat sun, it also shits on various other teams. The Evs on this Poke are Standard once again, Max Attack for more power, Max Speed to get benefited by Dragon Dance, and 4 HP evs are there to abuse MultiScale. This poke is the second best dragon in the team. I could’ve chosen Haxorus but it doesn’t get along with this team. Fire Punch is to hit steel typing hard, Extremespeed with 2x Priority is sooooo gooooood, +2 Extremespeed after the Hazard Damage OHKOS Mamoswine, Outrage is the only Stab move which fuckin destroys so much shit. I’ve been debating on replacing it with Dragon Claw but I’m not sure yet. Lum Berry makes this monster set up on so many walls. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><em>So after analyzing this team from a completely tactical standpoint, there are very few flaws. Stopping one sweeper can be relatively easy. Stopping 5 of the best sweepers in the game, with rocks and spikes on the field is almost impossible. This is one of the best teams I’ve seen in a long time and I’m sure I’ll see it plenty of times on the ladder as people start to copy it and make slight variations, ruining it completely. This team only has one goal: to completely overwhelm the opponent and stop them from gaining any semblance of momentum or hope. A real hope destroyer and demoralizer. I can’t say enough about the job MostWanted did with this team. Kudos, to him. I hope everyone enjoyed this RMT. Good luck battling.</em></p>

<p>Overall this team has been so good. It has to be one of the best Hyper Offensive teams ever made. I’ve peaked in highly 1500s with my various alts. I highly recommend you guys to play with this team and enjoy its success. This RMT has taken a while but it’s about time that it’s finally finished. Thank you all for reading this. Deuces.</p>
