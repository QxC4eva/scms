[SHORT DESC]
The target will attack immediately after the user in the same turn.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Causes the target to take its turn immediately after the user this turn, no matter the priority of its selected move. Fails if the target would have moved next anyway, or if the target already moved this turn. This move ignores Protect and Detect. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>After You is certainly an interesting move; however, it suffers from poor distribution. Its main use would be in double or triple battles, by targeting a slow but powerful ally such as Rampardos or Rhyperior to make it move first next turn and dish out powerful moves, or else enabling an ally with Trick Room to set up before it can be Taunted or put to sleep. After You allows moves with negative priority to go first, which can be useful with Roar and Whirlwind, phazing out the opponent before it can act.</p>
