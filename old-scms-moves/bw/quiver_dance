<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>A newly introduced move in this generation, and right from the early days of BW it was considered one of the best set-up moves in the entire game. As a move that makes the target a sweeper and a bulky threat (at least on the special side) at the same time, it is indeed a good thing. However, only few Pokemon that have access to this move can put it to good use. Volcarona is the obvious one when going for an offensive route, as it has colossal natural stats and brilliant STAB coverage. Lilligant is the other big sweeper, and can set up more easily using Sleep Powder alongside its Chlorophyll ability.</p>

<p>Venomoth can abuse the move in two different ways, as it can be a decent offensive force thanks to its good stats and Tinted Lens ability, but it can also use a combination of Quiver Dance and Baton Pass, allowing another, more suitable recipient do the sweep. Anyhow, always keep in mind that this move can often change the outcome of a match, so be wary.</p>
