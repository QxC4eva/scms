Overview
########
A new generation of Little Cup has begun, and Gligar is once again up to bat. If Gligar were to be described in a word, that word would be "dominant". Gligar is an absolute monster at anything it wants to do, be that sweeping, revenge killing, walling, or passing boosts to teammates. It is often the case that Gligar simply does the above better than most other Pokemon in the tier, and it is thus no surprise that Gligar has skyrocketed to the top of the usage stats from the beginning of XY LC.

Gligar's stats are menacing across the board, hitting both the illustrious 19 Speed and an all-but-unparalleled 33 Defense with Eviolite, depending on which set it would like to run. Speaking of running, that's what many Pokemon in LC seem to do at the first sight of Gligar, especially the myriad of Fighting-types that Gligar preys upon. Gligar is so prevalent in LC, in fact, that many Pokemon run Ice-type moves simply to eliminate it. Gligar is perfect for teams looking for something to sponge physical hits, a sweeper with strong STABs that isn't difficult to set up, a speedy pivot with valuable immunities, or all of the above.

AcroBerry
########
name: AcroBerry
move 1: Acrobatics
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Substitute / Swords Dance
move 4: Stealth Rock / Defog
ability: Hyper Cutter
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
This set allows Gligar to function as an offensive pivot with the potential to devastate teams late-game. Once Berry Juice is consumed, Acrobatics becomes a 110 Base Power STAB move that hits most of the tier, especially Fighting-types, for massive damage. Earthquake is similarly reliable, and also complements Acrobatics almost perfectly, hitting Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types, three types that resist Acrobatics, super effectively. Substitute is the easiest move to use on this set, and can allow you to activate Berry Juice manually if you are uncomfortable with taking hits. Swords Dance is riskier, but makes Gligar more effective if you know when it can safely set up. Stealth Rock and Defog are simply options for Gligar to support the team prior to its Berry Juice being consumed, with the former setting up hazards to aid other sweepers and the latter allowing Gligar to support Stealth Rock-weak allies and handle Sticky Web teams. Essentially, Gligar is free to use any move it would like in that fourth moveslot, including Knock Off, Taunt, U-turn, or even Baton Pass.

Set Details
========
The given EVs and nature allow Gligar to hit 19 Speed, which means it will outspeed or tie the entire unboosted tier with a few exceptions. Berry Juice is a perfect item for this set, as it allows Gligar to use its natural bulk to repeatedly sponge attacks and then return to full HP and begin sweeping with Acrobatics. Gligar is strong with very little support and flexible enough that it can do its best to support the team rather than rely on the team to support it. Hyper Cutter is the chosen ability, as Immunity is illegal with Stealth Rock and Defog, and sandstorm isn't a common enough condition to merit the use of Sand Veil. Hyper Cutter also prevents Intimidate Snubbull, Scraggy, and Growlithe from ruining Gligar's fun.

It is worth mentioning that Gligar can opt not to use an item with this set, which allows Gligar to use boosted Acrobatics from the get go. This allows Gligar to net surprise OHKOes on Meditite and Mienfoo, who can take an unboosted Acrobatics. 

Usage Tips
========
This Gligar is very prone to being baited, as many teams benefit from the removal of this set. A good example is when you lead with Gligar and your opponent leads with Chinchou or Magnemite. It might seem obvious to go for the Earthquake, but it is equally likely that they are using a Choice Scarf set with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Ice respectively solely for the purpose of eliminating Gligar. Another good example is Croagunk, which might try to get Gligar to switch in only to be decimated by Icy Wind. Gligar is a great candidate for teams looking for a Pokemon to take Knock Off mid-game, as many Pokemon do not like losing their Eviolite but Gligar benefits from a weak Knock Off (especially from Mienfoo) by being able to start using full-powered Acrobatics. The other way to consume Berry Juice, which you will likely be using more often, is simply to use Gligar as a pivot, repeatedly taking hits when needed for the team until it drinks its Berry Juice. Flying Gem is unreleased at this time, so Gligar cannot use that item to immediately start sweeping.

Team Options
========
Gligar needs teammates that can take Ice-type moves for it, and Munchlax with Thick Fat is a prime candidate for this job. Many times, people will try to force Speed ties with Gligar to deal with it, as there are a variety of Pokemon that sit at 19 Speed. Misdreavus is a serious offender, as it wants nothing more than to win the Speed tie and cripple Gligar with Will-O-Wisp; Munchlax with Rest handles Misdreavus with ease, as does Porygon. Ponyta might try the same antics, and is easily dealt with by Slowpoke, who can also handle Choice Scarf Meditite. Staryu can take a hit from Gligar so it doesn't even need to win the Speed tie, and Foongus and Croagunk both handle Staryu while baiting Ground-type moves from other Pokemon that Gligar can switch into imperviously.

Other sweepers, such as Tirtouga, Scraggy, and Swirlix appreciate Stealth Rock and how reliably Gligar sets it up. Thunder Punch Meditite is also one of the best possible teammates for this set, as it baits in Slowpoke and eliminates it, making it much easier for Gligar to sweep late-game. Gligar is prone to getting hit by Will-O-Wisp, as mentioned above; Flash Fire Houndour can switch into Will-O-Wisp all day and has near perfect synergy type-wise with Gligar. If Gligar does get burned, all is not lost. Aromatherapy Spritzee is a good teammate that also has access to Wish to ease Gligar's switch-ins.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Stealth Rock / Defog
move 2: Roost
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: U-turn / Knock Off
ability: Hyper Cutter
item: Eviolite
evs: 156 HP / 236 Def / 76 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========
Stealth Rock is great for every team, and Gligar is one of the bulkiest Pokemon with access to it in LC. Alternatively, for teams looking to use a defensive Gligar spread that are weak to Stealth Rock, Gligar can use Defog to ensure entry hazards stay off the field. Roost keeps Gligar healthy throughout the match, but temporarily makes Gligar take more damage from Fighting- and Grass-type moves, so it must be used cautiously. Earthquake is the only STAB move on this set, but still provides quite a bit of coverage. U-turn is the primary option in the last slot to allow Gligar to put the momentum of the game in its user's favor after forcing something out, but Knock Off is similarly useful if there are other offensive threats on the team that appreciate bulky Water-types and Misdreavus losing their Eviolites.

Set Details
========
This set hits a whopping 33 Defense, which allows Gligar to take hits all game and Roost off the damage. This is especially useful for teams that appreciate Stealth Rock being set up repeatedly, and makes it much harder for Tirtouga and Magnemite to make use of Sturdy. Without any investment in Speed, Gligar reaches a stat of 15, meaning it will still beat most Mienfoo and Pawniard but will not even come close to the 19 Speed Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Staryu, and Murkrow. Eviolite is the preferred item to boost Gligar's defense to astonishing levels and also essentially negate the bonus damage from Knock Off. Hyper Cutter is the ability of choice as Stealth Rock and Defog are illegal with Immunity and Gligar appreciates not being weakened by Pokemon with Intimidate.

Usage Tips
========
This Gligar is best used against threats that you are positive cannot kill it. For example, if you don't know if the opponent's Meditite has Ice Punch, assume it has Ice Punch until you know otherwise. If you don't know if the opponent's Archen has Hidden Power Ice, assume it has Hidden Power Ice until you know otherwise. Gligar needs to stay healthy throughout the match in order to be effective. This set works really well when Gligar's typing brings a lot to your team but your team is already pretty frail. As you don't have Acrobatics on this set, Gligar should try to avoid switching into Knock Off if possible, so other checks to Mienfoo and Timburr might be beneficial to have on the team. If preserved, Eviolite will let Gligar live all sorts of absurdly strong super effective moves, so don't be afraid to take a few more hits than the Berry Juice set would. A good example of this are weaker Water-type attacks. This Gligar struggles against Grass-types, as it lacks Acrobatics and they will harm it if it tries to Roost.

Team Options
========
Something that can beat opposing bulky Water-types is a valuable defensive teammate for this set. Munchlax and Ferroseed are all good options, and Ferroseed can also set up Spikes as well. Snover is a good offensive teammate, as it appreciates Stealth Rock and a teammate that can take Fighting-type attacks. This Gligar seems to last forever, so teammates that can inflict status are very beneficial. Toxic Spikes is difficult to set up, but both Tentacool and Koffing can do so semi-reliably; a better option is to use a similarly bulky teammate such as Slowpoke or Spritzee with Toxic. Porygon is also a good defensive teammate as it can check both Misdreavus and Chinchou via its Normal typing and Trace, respectively.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Knock Off / Aqua Tail
ability: Hyper Cutter
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========
This set allows Gligar to make even greater use of its high Speed and become a devastating revenge killer. Earthquake is simply a strong STAB coverage move, best used for picking off weakened opponents or breaking holes in the opponent's team early. Rock Slide provides excellent coverage alongside Earthquake, and due to the fact that most Flying-types Gligar wants to take out are rather frail, is superior to Stone Edge. U-turn is going to be the move you find yourself clicking most of the time, useful for scouting what Pokemon on the opposing team are physically defensive and putting the momentum in your favor. Knock Off is the best move for the last slot, as it allows Gligar to quickly remove the opponent's Eviolites and Berry Juices, allowing Gligar's teammates to have an easier time sweeping. Alternatively, Aqua Tail can be used to deal heavy damage to other Gligar.

Set Details
========
This variant of Gligar hits a whopping 28 Speed, outspeeding the entire unboosted tier and nearly every common Choice Scarf user, as well. This is great for taking out the Electric-types that sit at 20 Speed, Elekid and Voltorb, which typically carry an Ice-type move, as well as Compound Eyes Yanma. This further allows Gligar to pick off weakened Pokemon that sit at 19 Speed and are willing to stay in because they think they are risking a Speed tie when in reality, they are far less agile than the Choice Scarfed bat. Running maximum Speed is not entirely necessary, but this ensures Gligar will still sit at 19 Speed in the case that its Choice Scarf gets Knocked Off. Furthermore, it allows Gligar to outspeed a few boosted Pokemon, including Clamperl after a Shell Smash and Adamant Shellder after a Shell Smash.

Usage Tips
========
This set is great for grabbing momentum early-game and revenge killing late-game. It is best to bluff that you have Berry Juice as long as possible so you can net a kill on other Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Chinchou, that think they will outspeed. Obviously, once Gligar drops below 50% HP, you will no longer be able to bluff this, so Gligar cannot afford to repeatedly switch in. This set works really well in conjunction with other Pokemon with U-turn and Volt Switch. Due to the fact that a variety of threats are immune to Gligar's Earthquake, it is best to just repeatedly use U-turn early on in the game until you are confident you know what the opponent will switch in and nothing can set up on you if you choose the wrong move. If you opt to use Knock Off, the best time to start using it is when the opponent starts relying on defensive Pokemon with recovery (such as Slowpoke) to repeatedly sponge Gligar's U-turns.

Team Options
========
This set is great to use in conjunction with Pokemon that have similar checks to Gligar. U-turn weakens many of them to the point where they are no longer problematic. For example, Life Orb Meditite normally struggles against Slowpoke but is able to break through it after Gligar hits it with a super effective U-turn. Choice Scarf Gligar is also able to take out Choice Scarf Chinchou, allowing Shellder to set up and sweep with greater ease. Carvanha is a good teammate as it forms an effective wallbreaking duo with Gligar and has complementary typing. This set also makes it very easy to bring in Swirlix (either Calm Mind or Belly Drum), as most people will try to use weaker, super effective attacks on Gligar, which will not do much to Swirlix. Stealth Rock support is vital when you are causing switches through U-turn; Ferroseed is a good teammate that can handle defensive Chinchou and Staryu.

Baton Pass
########
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Substitute / Swords Dance
move 3: Acrobatics
move 4: Swords Dance / Earthquake
ability: Hyper Cutter
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
As Torchic with Speed Boost is now legal to use in Little Cup, Baton Pass chains are now an extremely effective strategy. Gligar, due to its myriad of resistances and 19 Speed, can easily force a switch, set up a Substitute, and then pass that to a teammate that resists the opponent's attack of choice. Acrobatics is strong enough to allow Gligar to also be an effective Baton Pass receiver, enjoying both the Speed Boosts and Swords Dances Torchic can Baton Pass to it while working in conjunction with Substitute and Berry Juice. Swords Dance is another great boosting move that Gligar has access to, but you might find having a second STAB move in Earthquake is more valuable if Gligar is the strongest candidate to receive boosts on your team. Gligar has a plethora of other options to pass, including Rock Polish and the gimmicky Power Trick.

Set Details
========
This set is extremely similar to the AcroBerry set in nearly every way except its ultimate goal. Because of this, Gligar still has the offensive prowess to sweep late-game, the combination of good bulk, typing, and Berry Juice to take a few hits, and still hits 19 Speed to pick off weaker Pokemon. In order to accomplish all of these things, Gligar needs maximum Speed with a Jolly nature and maximum Attack; it is especially easy for other Pokemon to set up on Gligar if it is running a defensive set and Baton Pass. Hyper Cutter has more use on this set than the others as it prevents Intimidate users from messing with a Baton Pass chain.

Usage Tips
========
This set is useful as a lead as many Pokemon will assume you are going to try to set up Stealth Rock and allow you to get a free Substitute or Swords Dance. This set also lets Gligar be unafraid of its common switch-ins, as it can set up a Substitute while they switch in and then Baton Pass away before they ever get a chance to touch it; this has the added benefit of preventing Gligar from being crippled by Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. The most common way to use this set is to use the element of surprise to Baton Pass from Gligar to something with devastating offensive prowess to put a lot of pressure on the opponent early, and then use Gligar to finish off the opponent's Pokemon late-game. This Gligar should be Baton Passing at every given opportunity, and there are quite a lot of those due to its great typing and bulk even without Eviolite. For example, if a Fighting-type such as Mienfoo comes in and you predict it will use Knock Off, bring Gligar in, set up a Substitute or a boost as you force it out, and then Baton Pass to an appropriate teammate.

Team Options
========
Torchic is the best teammate, as Gligar can Baton Pass a Substitute to Torchic against an Ice-type attack, allowing Torchic then to pass a Swords Dance or Focus Energy and at least +2 Speed to something else. Meditite is already an incredibly strong Pokemon with great coverage and also combines with this core well. When Meditite has a Substitute, for example, it has a very easy time choosing the appropriate move to 2HKO its switch-ins, with fewer repercussions if it predicts incorrectly. Mienfoo also has Baton Pass to continue the chain and has Regenerator to ensure it can repeatedly receive and pass. Munchlax, although typically used as a wall, is actually a good Baton Pass recipient for sets with Swords Dance. Specially based threats will have a hard time busting through it while it can use a wide variety of coverage moves such as Fire Punch and Ice Punch, crippling STAB such as Body Slam, and Pursuit to eliminate fleeing Ghost-types. Gligar needs a teammate that can handle the common phazers in the tier, including Roar Archen, Whirlwind Hippopotas, and Whirlwind Munchlax. Magnemite and Chinchou handle Archen and both have Volt Switch to get Gligar in safely. Hippopotas and Archen are both handled by bulky Water-types such as Staryu and Frillish. Munchlax can be eliminated by any of the Fighting-types above. When Gligar has Substitute, nearly every offensive threat will appreciate it as a teammate. For example, Shell Smash Clamperl, if it gets in with Substitute intact, will get a free Shell Smash, and the Shell Smash Sturdy Pokemon, Tirtouga and Dwebble, can take as many as 4 hits for free if brought in safely.

Taunt + Toxic
########
name: Taunt + Toxic
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Roost
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Immunity
item: Eviolite
evs: 156 HP / 76 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Some offensive teams can struggle to break through particular defensive cores, especially those with Regenerator on multiple Pokemon or Wish support. This variant of Gligar, through Taunt and Toxic, aims to completely shut down defensive Pokemon while still providing some offensive pressure through Earthquake. At 19 Speed, Gligar is tied for the position of second fastest Taunt user in the tier Speed with Misdreavus, sitting behind only Voltorb. When the opponent's specially based threats have been eliminated, Gligar can actually "sweep" many of the physically inclined teams of the tier using only the combination of Toxic + Roost to rack up residual damage. Earthquake provides the potent Gligar with some offensive capabilities and hits the Pokemon that are immune to Toxic: Steel-types and Poison-types.

Set Details
========
In order to make use of such a fast Taunt, Gligar needs to run maximum Speed and a Jolly nature. The rest of the EVs are put in Defense and HP, which gives Gligar significant bulk in conjunction with Eviolite. Immunity is legal for this set, as Defog is not present, and is valuable as it prevents Gligar from being poisoned by other defensive threats.

Usage Tips
========
This Gligar works well early if it can avoid getting hit by Knock Off. As Gligar is so bulky and can cause switches, it is best to use it as a pivot that repeatedly spreads status across the opposing team. Knock Off could even be used over Earthquake if one really wanted to make use of Gligar's ability to cripple Pokemon that switch in. Gligar still sits at 19 Speed, so it can still revenge kill many Pokemon in the tier that are weak to Earthquake, such as defensive Chinchou and Pawniard. If Gligar is preserved, it will absolutely shine late-game, where it will find itself walling most if not all of the opposing team while racking up residual damage and staying healthy through Roost. In Team Preview, it is important to focus on finding what the big threats to Gligar are offensively, such as Staryu and Snover, and figuring out what your team can do to eliminate them.

Team Options
========
If this Gligar is being used on a defensive team, Ferroseed is probably the best possible teammate. It can set up Spikes and spread paralysis through Thunder Wave to slow down offensive Pokemon while Gligar spreads Toxic to incapacitate defensive Pokemon. A bulky Normal-type such as Munchlax, Lickitung, or Porygon is also a must. Each one has its own benefits: Munchlax takes next to nothing from Ice-type attacks, Lickitung can rack up residual damage on an entry hazard-based team through Dragon Tail, and Porygon can eliminate Misdreavus. As mentioned, this Gligar is not merely limited to being used on stall or defensive teams; it is also useful on offensive or balanced teams that have trouble breaking through defensive cores. Taunt allows Gligar to function as a great lead, as it can prevent Stealth Rock from being set up by anything slower than it. This makes defensive Growlithe a good teammate, as it enjoys not having to worry about Stealth Rock and can help Gligar out in spreading Toxic amongst the opposing team. The two big clerics of the tier, Heal Bell Chinchou and Aromatherapy Spritzee, obviously cause this set much anxiety, so teammates that handle them are appreciated. If Porygon has Trace, it can take advantage of Chinchou's Volt Absorb. Foongus can handle both of the clerics through the combination of Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, and can do this repeatedly due to Regenerator.

Other Options
########
Cross Poison is a solid move with the notable pros of hitting Fairy-types super effectively, having a chance to poison the foe, and having a high critical hit rate, even if it is slightly weak. Steel Wing and Iron Tail both also hit Fairy-types super effectively but offer virtually no other benefits. Knock Off is a strong enough move this generation that it can be fit onto basically any of Gligar's sets easily. Thief is convenient for Gligar, as it allows it to recover with Berry Juice and then potentially steal another Berry Juice or even an Eviolite, but it should not be used in conjunction with Acrobatics. Defog can be used over Stealth Rock depending on the team's needs. However, it is typically not a great idea to use them together on the same set, as you essentially negate one of your own moveslots every game; Stealth Rock is rendered useless if you need to use Defog, and Defog is rendered useless if the opponent does not have entry hazards.

Checks & Counters
########
**Bronzor**: Bronzor resists Acrobatics and Rock Slide and is immune to Earthquake and Toxic. It can also run Hidden Power Ice to eliminate Gligar.

**Choice Scarf Pokemon**: Snover can outspeed and OHKO all variants of Gligar with Blizzard bar Choice Scarf sets. Chinchou has access to both Ice Beam and Hydro Pump to OHKO Gligar, but will not outspeed the Choice Scarf sets. Magnemite typically runs Hidden Power Ice.

**Random Ice-type Moves**: Many things run a seemingly random Ice-type moves just so their team can have an easier time dealing with Gligar. Good examples include Ice Punch Meditite, Ice Punch Timburr, Hidden Power Ice Archen, Hidden Power Ice Magnemite, Hidden Power Ice Voltorb, Icy Wind Croagunk, and Icy Wind Murkrow.

**Eviolite Pokemon with Recovery**: Slowpoke can switch into every move Gligar has with the exceptions of Toxic and Knock Off. Furthermore, it has Regenerator to do this infinitely and Scald to potentially burn Gligar. Porygon will outstall offensive sets that do not have Swords Dance before Berry Juice is consumed and can run Ice Beam. Archen resists Acrobatics, is immune to Earthquake, and can repeatedly switch in and Roost off damage. Spritzee is naturally bulky and has Wish, but will not enjoy losing its Eviolite.

**19 Speed Pokemon**: Although by no means hard counters, other Pokemon at 19 Speed will give Gligar headaches. Misdreavus can live a hit anyways, but might cripple Gligar with Will-O-Wisp before it gets a chance to strike. Staryu is bulky enough to take a hit as well but may just instantly OHKO offensive Gligar with Hydro Pump. Ponyta is riskier, but still might be able to use Will-O-Wisp before Gligar gets an Earthquake off.

**Elekid and Voltorb**: These Pokemon reach 20 Speed and carry Ice Punch or Hidden Power Ice respectively to take down all variants of Gligar except the Choice Scarf set.

**Gothita and Wynaut**: These Pokemon both have Shadow Tag to trap Gligar. Gothita typically uses a Choice Scarf to KO with Hidden Power Ice, while Wynaut is bulky enough to take a hit and then KO Gligar with Counter.
