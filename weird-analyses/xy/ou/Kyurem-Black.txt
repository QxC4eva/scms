Overview
########

Boasting amazing stats across the board, with a ridiculous base 170 Attack, solid 120 Special Attack, decent Speed, and great bulk, Kyurem-B proves a force to be reckoned with in OU. It most commonly utilizes a Substitute set with mixed Fusion Bolt / Ice Beam / Earth Power for coverage, which devastates defensive and offensive teams alike given its immense power. This set alone tears apart much of common OU defensive and balanced teams with ease, but that's not all. Kyurem-B also has great versatility, able to utilize the strongest Outrage in OU, Roost to keep, and even a defensive set to handle top OU threats. It isn't without its flaws, with crippling weaknesses to Stealth Rock, Fighting, Steel, Fairy, and Dragon, as well as an only decent Speed stat; however, despite all this, Kyurem-B shines as one of OU's preeminent attackers that is a threat to every team.

Substitute Attacker
########
name: Substitute Attacker
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Fusion Bolt
move 4: Earth Power
item: Leftovers
nature: Mild / Rash
evs: 56 HP / 200 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Substitute blocks Kyurem-B from status, Leech Seed (this screws over Mega Venusaur, Trevenant, and Gourgeist), priority, and revenge killers, easing prediction immensely and making it overall more difficult for the foe to deal with Kyurem-B. Ice Beam is the strong STAB attack on this set, dishing out heavy damage to all but resists and specially bulky foes whilst eliminating common defensive Ground-, Grass-, and Flying-type foes, even felling Mega Venusaur because Teravolt ignores Thick Fat. Fusion Bolt dispatches Water-types, such as Gyarados, Vaporeon, Azumarill, Manaphy and Jellicent, and does the most damage of any move to Sylveon and Assault Vest Conkeldurr. Earth Power rounds out the coverage by nailing Heatran, Rotom-W, Aegislash, Bisharp, Mega Mawile, and Klefki, among various other Fire- and Steel-type foes.

Set Details
========

The HP EVs ensure you have an HP number above 404, which ensures your Substitutes are not broken by Seismic Tosses from Blissey and Chansey, allowing Kyurem-B to get a bit more Leftovers recovery before being forced out, as it cannot do much to harm either significantly. With full Speed investment, Kyurem-B at least ties opposing neutral Kyurem-B. 248 EVs would be enough for Jolly Gyarados, which you definitely want to outrun; four more EVs just provides a small benefit from time to time. The rest is dumped into Special Attack to power up Ice Beam and Earth Power. You can run a Mild nature if you'd prefer to take special hits from the likes of Manaphy a bit better, or a Rash nature if attacks from Pokemon like Gyarados are of particular concern.

Usage Tips
========

Getting in Kyurem-B is pretty easy; it has a number of nice resistances, including Electric, Water, and Grass, and generally has pretty good bulk. Once you get an opportunity to switch in, set up a Substitute and proceed to fire off attacks as appropriate. Kyurem-B is one of the scariest attackers in the game, period. Behind a Substitute, it's just that much more difficult to deal with. You want to err on the side of caution against possible status or Leech Seed users, as getting hit with either is extremely crippling to Kyurem-B, so definitely Substitute in those scenarios. However, don't waste them; if the opponent can simply break your Substitute after you set it up, then you've just wasted a quarter of Kyurem-B's health for nothing. It can be worth it to scout, though.

As obvious as it may sound, Kyurem-B is one Pokemon you really want to preserve against defensive teams. Pokemon such as Blissey, Chansey, Clefable, and Sylveon often stand in its way; if you are patient and get rid of those Pokemon, such teams tend to be easy pickings for Kyurem-B.

Team Options
========

Defog support is a must because hazards limit Kyurem-B's longevity immensely. Because of this, Latios makes an excellent partner, forming a devastating offensive duo with Kyurem-B that can ravage opposing teams. Rapid Spin Excadrill also makes for a solid choice. Running an offensive Steel-type, such as Bisharp, Iron Head Aegislash, or Scizor, helps against pesky Clefable and Sylveon. As these Pokemon carry powerful physical attacks, they can also threaten Blissey and Chansey, meaning they can eliminate virtually all counters to this Kyurem-B. Finally, Pokemon prone to being walled by common defensive Pokemon in general, such as Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Keldeo, will love the wallbreaking support Kyurem-B provides. With their counters eliminated, it is often easy for these Pokemon to overwhelm opposing teams.

Physically Based Mixed Attacker
########
name: Physically Based Mixed Attacker
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Fusion Bolt
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Earth Power
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty

Moves
========

Outrage is the main event on this set; it's almost like an easy button in that if you want something dead, it will do the job. It also rips apart Blissey and Chansey, two of the best counters to the Substitute set. However, due to the lock-in, you can't just go around spamming it. Fusion Bolt takes the role of spam move due to its solid power and coverage, wrecking Pokemon like Sylveon, Mandibuzz, Clefable and Manaphy with ease. Ice Beam mainly hits Ground-types, especially Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, in addition to physically bulky Pokemon in general, such as Ferrothorn. Earth Power rounds out Kyurem-B's coverage, smashing Rotom-W as well as various Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon, most notably Heatran.

Set Details
========
Maximum investment in Speed ensures you at least tie with opposing Kyurem-B, and a Hasty nature ensures things like Jolly Excadrill don't outrun you. Full Attack investment boosts physical power, the main focus of this set. Haban Berry is a good alternative in the item slot if you want to have a fighting chance against Latios, Latias, Garchomp, and other faster Dragon-types. Chople Berry also works to take Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Mega Lucario and Terrakion. The major downside of both items is that they don't boost Kyurem-B's power like Life Orb, which should always be the main priority of this set.

Usage Tips
========

Basically, you'll want to get this in on any move it resists and start firing off Fusion Bolts, your most powerful and reliable attack with this set. If an opposing switch-in is obvious, you may want to predict it, depending on the scenario, to take it out and prevent the foe from Life Orb stalling Kyurem-B with no repercussions. Use your coverage moves as necessary. Outrage is the move to use against Blissey and Chansey, as well as in scenarios where you don't really care what dies, but want something dead. It's really that powerful against everything that's not a physically defensive Steel-type or Fairy-type.

Preserve Kyurem-B if there's any wall in particular you want to get rid of, as in the majority of cases it can do the job. This might sound like an obvious point, but many players will sack Kyurem-B&mdash;their wallbreaker&mdash;prematurely before it has completed its goals. Kyurem-B can also clean if you remove its checks. If the opponent only has a couple blocks that prevent Kyurem-B from going on a rampage, aim to remove those and Kyurem-B will not disappoint late-game with its coverage and power.

Team Options
========

Virtually anything that's a sweeper will enjoy this Kyurem-B's presence, as it is the best wallbreakers and hole punchers in the game. Think Mega Lucario, Garchomp, etc. Special sweepers will appreciate the removal of Chansey, too, which this set can surprise with an Outrage. Growth Mega Venusaur in particular makes for an excellent partner, capitalizing on the removal of Chansey and other special walls whilst tanking Fighting-type attacks aimed at Kyurem-B with ease. Kyurem-B doesn't need much support on its own, but it definitely does require a Defog user, as hazards in conjunction with Life Orb damage will wear it down quickly. Mandibuzz, Latias, Latios, and Mega Scizor can fill this role handily; which one you choose depends on your team's specific needs. Alternatively, you can use Rapid Spin Excadrill.

Specially Based Mixed Attacker
########
name: Specially Based Mixed Attacker
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Fusion Bolt
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Roost
item: Life Orb
nature: Hasty
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Basically, this is the same moveset as the Substitute attacker, but with Roost over Substitute. Ice Beam is a devastating STAB weapon that brings many physically bulky Pokemon to their knees, especially bulky Grass- and Ground-types. Fusion Bolt smashes apart Water-types and most of the Fairy-types, including Sylveon, Togekiss, Azumarill, and Mega Gardevoir. Earth Power finishes out Kyurem-B's coverage by dealing with various Fire-, Electric-, and Steel-types, most significantly Heatran and Rotom-W. Roost keeps Kyurem-B healthy, mitigating Life Orb and possible hazard damage in addition to letting it more reliably utilize its decent hit-taking capabilities on the special side.

Hidden Power Fire or Outrage can be run over Roost if desired. Hidden Power Fire is mainly for Scizor, and does more damage to Ferrothorn than Ice Beam. Focus Blast has the same power against Ferrothorn and murders Tyranitar, a big pain for Kyurem-B in general. Meanwhile, Outrage hits Blissey and Chansey for major damage. The thing about all of these attacks is that they're only useful in select scenarios, and with Outrage you might as well run Attack EVs to boost its power, thus ending up with the previous set, which would defeat the whole purpose of this Kyurem-B. Roost is straight-up superior most of the time.

Set Details
========

This set runs a simple spread that maximizes Special Attack and Speed. You could drop the Speed down to 232, enough to outrun Mega Garchomp, but always at least tying with other Kyurem-B and Gliscor is more beneficial than a few extra Attack EVs. An Expert Belt can be run to bluff some sort of Choice variant, which is a logical conclusion if Kyurem-B lacks a Life Orb or Leftovers, and allow Kyurem-B to surprise Pokemon that come in to resist an attack that Kyurem-B is "locked into." Then, it can surprise the foe by switching attacks, likely taking out. Unfortunately, this makes it both slightly weaker against targets hit super effectively and rather weak against neutral targets, so it is typically inferior to Life Orb. Once again, a Haban Berry to take on Dragon-type foes or Chople Berry for Fighting-type ones can work, but the loss of power hurts more than needing to switch out against such Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========

You get this Kyurem-B in the same way as every other set: switching into resisted attacks. Aggressively switch it in whenever you find an opportunity and just throw out attacks. Something is bound to get hurt. Many opponents will attempt to scout Kyurem-B's moveset by switching around and luring various attacks. The best course of action is to predict opposing switch-ins and punish them with the appropriate attack, catching the opponent off guard and giving you an advantage. Roost when Kyurem-B starts to get low on health. This helps it switch in later and take on revenge killers aiming to finish it off with priority attacks.

One topic that must be addressed is why you would run this over the previous set in this analysis. This set has a great deal more special power, and so can rely on its special attacks to dish out serious damage, especially Ice Beam. This means that it isn't forced to resort to Outrage if it needs a strong STAB attack. It also has room to run Roost, which boosts its longevity significantly.

Team Options
========

Pretty much anything that appreciates a weakened team will love this Kyurem-B, which boasts excellent special coverage and power, as a teammate. Terrakion in particular enjoys its support, as Kyurem-B can remove virtually all of its counters, including Jellicent, Hippowdon, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Aegislash. Defog support is necessary, even with Roost, as hazards really put a damper on Kyurem-B's hit-taking ability and thus ease of switching in. Latios makes a stellar teammate for this purpose, as it can use Defog and aids in tearing apart teams with its powerful Draco Meteors. Alternatively, Rapid Spin Excadrill can be run.

Utility Check
########
name: Utility Check
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Fusion Bolt
move 3: Roost
move 4: Dragon Tail
item: Leftovers
nature: Hasty
evs: 248 HP / 60 SpD / 200 Spe

Moves
========

Ice Beam and Fusion Bolt provide Kyurem-B's staple coverage, allowing it to hit a variety of threats for solid damage even without offensive EVs. Roost is a source of recovery to keep it healthy, allowing Kyurem-B to switch in time and time again to take on foes. Dragon Tail is used in the last slot as a good emergency option against boosting foes. There are a couple other options if you'd rather have a bit more coverage. Earth Power hits Heatran, which this set otherwise barely manages to scrape. Dragon Claw is another solid alternative, boasting reliable STAB-boosted power and lacking negative priority.

Set Details
========

The EV spread might seem a bit odd for a bulky Kyurem-B, but it allows it to function at its best. 200 Speed EVs are enough to outrun Jolly Excadrill. The rest of the EVs are poured into HP and Special Defense to maximize Kyurem-B's bulk. A Hasty nature is run because Kyurem-B mainly handles special foes, and it can still handle the same physical ones with a negative nature, for the most part. The Speed EVs can be bumped up to 232 for Jolly Mega Garchomp if desired, but this takes a toll on Kyurem-B's bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Basically, this set takes advantage of Kyurem-B's resistances to switch into various attacks and phaze or force the foe out. It is a great Manaphy and non-Stone Edge Gyarados check, and can take on Pokemon like Greninja, special Genesect, and Heatran quite nicely. It takes advantage of its resistances to Water, Electric, and Grass and generally solid bulk to function as a check to a variety of Pokemon. Don't get cocky with it, though, especially against foes that might carry super effective attacks. That's not what this Kyurem-B is meant to take. You shouldn't be expecting it to deal heavy damage; while Kyurem-B's power is still remarkable, it just doesn't have the wallbreaking potential of the other sets. Power is one of this set's strong points, actually; it is one of the few bulky Pokemon that can be both bulky and speedy whilst dealing solid damage in return. You want to attack a lot with Ice Beam and Fusion Bolt, and Roost or phaze as needed.

Team Options
========

This Kyurem-B is a team player, serving as a great switch-in to a variety of attacks. However, there are a couple forms of support it needs. A solid Fighting-type and Scizor switch-in is necessary, as Kyurem-B attracts them like a dog does fleas. Sylveon, Blissey, and Chansey also laugh at this set, taking little damage from all of its attacks and attacking (Sylveon) or crippling it with Toxic (the blobs). Landorus-T, Latios, Latias, Mega Scizor, and Gliscor serve as excellent partners for this reason. Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock, which Dragon Tail can take advantage of to shuffle around and chip away at the opposing team. The others can all run Defog, which gets rid of the Stealth Rock that especially this Kyurem-B hates, as it neuters its hit-taking capabilities. Mega Scizor can take out Sylveon, which is a major plus. Alternatively, you can run Stealth Rock + Rapid Spin Excadrill in conjunction with a Spikes setter, such as Skarmory or Deoxys-D, and deal even more damage to the opposing team when shuffling with Dragon Tail whilst still ensuring hazards on your side of the field are removed.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Fusion Bolt
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Dragon Claw
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Lonely

Moves
========

On this set, Outrage is the main event, steamrolling foes like they're nothing thanks to Kyurem-B's Choice Band-supplemented base 170 Attack. However, due to the lock-in, you can't just go around spamming it, especially with the prevalence of Fairy-types. Fusion Bolt is useful for that purpose and demolishes Water-types, almost every OU Fairy, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz. The remaining two moves are basically filler, but have their uses. Ice Beam might look out of place on a Choice Band set, but 2HKOing Hippowdon and OHKOing Landorus-T and Gliscor is no small feat; although Outrage might do the same thing, Ice Beam lacks the debilitating lock-in. Dragon Claw rounds out the set as the attack that you use when you need the STAB power, for whatever reason, but don't want to suffer a lock-in. Often, resorting to Outrage or using Fusion Bolt is a better option, but Dragon Claw has its uses. Freeze Shock is a usable alternative, achieving insane feats like OHKOing Ferrothorn, but has a charge turn that allows the opponent to play around it fairly easily. However, due to its insane STAB-boosted power, you can be assured that whatever you do hit will get hurt.

Set Details
========

The EVs are pretty simple; max Speed ensures you at least tie opposing neutral-natured Kyurem-B, while full Attack investment gives it the most possible power. A Lonely nature provides an Attack boost to make Kyurem-B even more powerful whilst preserving its Special Attack and Special Defense, ensuring its Ice Beam isn't too weak and granting it more switch-in opportunities.

Usage Tips
========

Kyurem-B has a number of resistances and solid bulk; utilizes these traits to bring it in whenever you can and start firing off attacks. If the opponent has a Fairy- or physically bulky Steel-type, Fusion Bolt will usually do the job to ensure their death&mdash;unless it's Ferrothorn, which Outrage has a good chance to 2HKO after Stealth Rock. If these Pokemon are removed, Outrage is a good option. It's basically an easy button; if you want something dead, click it. However, in addition to possible targets it might be ineffective against, you also have to be wary of potential revenge killers, such as Scizor, Mega Lucario, or Latios. Assess whether it's worth it to take out the Pokemon your up against and sacrifice Kyurem-B, or if you'd rather switch it out and bring it back in later. In these scenarios, Dragon Claw should be your attack of choice. It's still boosted by STAB, and has decent BP, so it's powerful enough. Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon will typically try to scout for Ice Beam, so attempt to lure them into thinking that your Kyurem-B doesn't carry it by using Dragon Claw in the first encounter. This will make them think they can switch in later with ease, at which point you can KO with Ice Beam without having to resort to Outrage in order to take them out.

This set might seem largely out of place in the presence of other sets, but boasts a couple advantages. First off, its physical power is through the roof; it is literally guaranteed to hurt something with its physical attacks. The main downside is the inability to switch moves, which allows other Kyurem-B to adapt and handle a variety of different Pokemon that switch into it. However, none can match this Kyurem-B in power, which is the whole purpose of using it.

Team Options
========

A Defog user is pretty important, as hazards&mdash;especially Stealth Rock&mdash;take a massive toll on Kyurem-B's switch-in capabilities. You'll also want a way to get past Ferrothorn other than banking on the chance to 2HKO with Outrage after Stealth Rock. For this reason, Life Orb Hidden Power Fire Latios and Latias make for stellar teammates. The choice between the two depends on whether you prioritize power or bulk, which varies depending on your team. Either way, a dual Dragon strategy, especially with Kyurem-B's ability to destroy Fairies, does wonder in breaking down opposing teams. A Pokemon like Choice Band Talonflame, Mega Scizor, or Mega Lucario can clean up the scraps of said weakened teams.

Other Options
########

A physically based variant of the Substitute attacker set with Dragon Claw over Earth Power can work, but the lack of Earth Power really blows coverage-wise, so you're generally better off with the given set or the physically based mixed set that boasts full coverage. Choice Scarf Kyurem-B was a nice revenge killer in BW, but the introduction of other Pokemon, such as Talonflame, better suited to a revenge killing role, Fairy-types that can easily take its STAB Dragon-type attacks, return of Genesect to OU, and how restricted Kyurem-B is without the ability to switch moves have made it fall from favor. Another set that has fallen from favor is Substitute + Hone Claws with Roost and Dragon Tail. First off, Fairy-types stop this set in its tracks. More significantly, Defog users threaten to remove the hazards this set relies on to deal truly significant damage. These factors in combination with the lack of coverage and power make this set an inferior option this generation. An Assault Vest might seem like a good option to take special attacks even better, but Leftovers and Roost recovery are a major factor as to why bulky Kyurem-B works so well, and offensive sets would rather run a Life Orb to boost their power.

Checks and Counters
########

**Super effective priority**: Bullet Punch from (Mega) Scizor and Mach Punch from Conkeldurr and Breloom can fell slightly weakened Kyurem-B if it's not behind a Substitute.

**Mixed walls**: Pokemon such as Chansey, Umbreon, Ferrothorn, specially defensive Tyranitar, Assault Vest Conkeldurr, Assault Vest Excadrill, and Cofagrigus that have good mixed bulk handle the Substitute set well. All of them except Excadrill are felled by Outrage, though, and Excadrill cannot handle Choice Band-boosted Outrage at all.

**Fast Fighting- and Dragon-types**: Latios, Terrakion, Keldeo, Latias, Garchomp, and Noivern can all revenge kill Kyurem-B, forcing it out or killing it if it's locked into Outrage. Noivern doesn't even have to worry about Substitute, as thanks to Infiltrator it ignores the Substitute and can attack it directly with Draco Meteor.

**Stealth Rock**: Kyurem-B's weakness to Stealth Rock means that if you can keep it up, it loses 25% of its HP upon switching in. This limits its number of switch-in opportunities and wears it down extremely fast, making it easier to handle overall.

**Status**: Prankster Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Mega Banette and Sableye limits Kyurem-B's potency to an extent due to neutering Fusion Bolt and Outrage. Non-Prankster Will-O-Wisp users are generally KOed or would rather attack it, so they're not very significant. Toxic makes it die really fast if it stays in, wearing it down especially quickly with Life Orb and possible Stealth Rock damage. Paralysis makes it much easier to deal with, too, as it allows the large range of Pokemon outsped by Kyurem-B to hit it first.

**Fairies**: Particularly, physically defensive Sylveon and Clefable are immune to Outrage and generally handle Kyurem-B well. Both wall the Substitute and specially based mixed sets with ease, and Sylveon can even hit it behind its Substitute because Hyper Voice ignores it. Invested Fusion Bolt, especially from Choice Band variants, sends them packing, however.
