[LONG DESC]
<p>Prevents the target from using the same move twice in a row. If the target is forced to use the same move twice in a row due to Choice Band, Choice Scarf, Choice Specs, Disable, Encore, Taunt, or not having any other moves with PP remaining, the target uses Struggle every other turn. Effect is lost when the target switches out.
