    <p>The new release is upon us and, man, has it been a long time coming!</p>
    
    <p>First and foremost, our long-time editor, <a href="/forums/members/setsuna">Setsuna</a>, has retired. Setsuna was best known for his leading role in The Bourne Trilogy, but he was also our team leader for roughly the past two and a half years. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors, whatever they may be.</p>
    
    <p>The Smog goes on, though! And, since I "acquired" the password to the PayPal account that Setsuna inherited from Rising_Dusk <a href="/smog/issue19/note_from_editor">oh-so-many issues ago</a>, I will be taking his place as The Smog's new <del>corrupt overlord</del> editor.</p>
    
    <p>As always, a huge thanks goes out to all the <a href="contributors">contributors</a>. I’d especially like to note that the stunning artwork you see on the cover of this issue is courtesy of <a href="/forums/members/">Magistrum</a>. Be sure to let us know what you think in the new-and-improved <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/Z0TQaBRmdN">reader feedback survey</a>, as well. Thanks for reading!</p>
