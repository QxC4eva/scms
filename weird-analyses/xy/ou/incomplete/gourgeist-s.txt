move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Protect/Pain Split
move 4: Seed Bomb/Substitute
ability: Frisk
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 88 Def / 168 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
-Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and racks up passive damage.
-Leech Seed is your source of healing, good passive damage with Will-O-Wisp and Protect.
-Protect scouts opponent while Pain Split gives decent healing.
-Seed Bomb hits Rotom-W, but Substitute gives a layer of protection.

Set Details
========

-168 speed evs with a jolly nature outspeeds jolly max speed Excadrill. Rest into HP and defense.
-Frisk is valuable, lets you scout items.
-Leftovers is mandatory as no reliable healing.

Usage Tips
========

-Don't use Leech Seed or Will-O-Wisp when opponent has pokemon like Heatran or Mega Venusaur.
-Don't spam Protect; easy to play around.
-Use Frisk to your advantage; switch in on physical attackers you can take.
-Gourgeist-S has speed; if you like bulk more use Gourgeist-H or Trevenant.

Team Options
========
-Gourgeist-S spinblocks Excadrill well, pairs well with hazards. Bisharp is a good partner, discouraging defog too. Gourgeist-S takes Fighting and Ground moves aimed at Bisharp.
-Gourgeist-S is Substitute fodder for Gengar, so be sure to pack a sturdy phazer, such as Heatran or Mandibuzz.
-Gourgeist-S has weak Special Defense, making Tyranitar and Heatran excellent partners. Great type synergy with Tyranitar in particular.
-Gourgeist-S hates status, so Sylveon and Chansey provides wish support and status control while also taking special attacks.
-Have a response to fire type sweepers, like Talonflame, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard-X; they can set up on Gourgeist-S freely.

Other Options
########

-Destiny Bond can surprise slower attackers.
-Phantom Force stalls out extra turns of leech seed and burn damage, but very easy to play around.
-Fire blast dents Ferrothorn and Scizor, but weak otherwise.
-Shadow Sneak provides useful priority, but very weak.
-A trick scarf set with Trick/Destiny Bond/Will-O-Wisp/Seed Bomb can be used, but outclassed by Rotom-W.
-Rock Slide hits fire types, but still weak.
-Sub-Disable is cool, but other pokemon do better.
-Insomnia can be used to ignore Dark Void (and Hypnosis).

Checks & Counters
########

-Fire types in general are bad, can switch in freely and set up or kill. Rotom-H in particular can also grab momentum.
-Strong special attackers can usually KO Gourgeist-S, like Greninja, Gengar, and Mega Lucario.
-Any fast user of substitute beats Gourgeist-S, like Kyurem-Black.
-Fast pokemon with Taunt shut it down, like Crobat, Sableye, or Thundurus.
-Gourgeist cannot get past grasses with recovery, such as Trevenant, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi.
-Clefable and Reuniclus set up freely.
