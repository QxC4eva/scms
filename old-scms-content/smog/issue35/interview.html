<div id="interview">
<div class="aside"><p>The bright sun's rays radiate through the cloudy sky and engulf the New Jersey streets in burning heat. Cars noisily cruise their ways, with people and birds dotting the area. Somewhere there, a restaurant stands out from the rest of the buildings, a special one that I'll be visiting today!</p>
<p>I enter the restaurant, greet the servers, and search for a man said to be suspicious. I don't really see anyone of that type, so I let a server guide me to a table. It's quite noisy in here! I order my food and wait for what seems to be a minute when a shady man with my appetizer comes to my table. His name-tag reads: kokoloko. He looks funny, but this is the man I need to talk with.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Hi kokoloko! It's nice to meet you! Let's start out by getting to know you. Name, job/education, location, and anything else you want to add? Oh, maybe racial background could be interesting!</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>yes hi hello, outside the land of smogon i'm known as dave. i went to university for two years and received an associates in business, then attempted to go for a masters in economics but i quickly realized i detested economics, which led me to drop out of school to pursue what i truly love to do: cooking.</p>
<p>i am currently working as a lead cook at a restaurant in maplewood, nj, and plan to further that career as much as i can.</p>
<p>also i'm guatemalan, but look straight-up white.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Cooking is one thing I completely didn't expect out of you. What do you cook at your restaurant?</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>pretty much anything. it's a rotating menu so it could be italian one day and mediterranean the next. i've learned so much over the past couple of years that i could pretty much cook up whatever you asked me to right now, lol.</p></div>
<div class="aside"><p>My appetizer has been left alone for quite some time... maybe I should eat it, but it would be very rude of me to eat AND talk! Sorry appetizer! Oh, and isn't it time for kokoloko to return back to the kitchen? Guess not.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>So you're that pro at it? Have you considered doing those Iron Chef-styled competitions or whatever is similar to those, or do you not like them?</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>nah, i'm not into reality tv at all. 90% of the shit you see on those shows is purely for the sake of the show. i refuse to believe the kids on masterchef junior are that fucking amazing, but if they actually are that good, then i'm not quite at that level yet, lol.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Haha, so it's kinda like those wresting shows. Okay, moving on. What's with your username? It sounds so silly, maybe Hawaiian (okay maybe not), and definitely rolls off the tongue well!</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>lol yeah, i've considered changing it before but i think i'm way past the point of name-recognition where it would be acceptable to change it. anyway, it's actually a nickname my older cousin called me when i was about, idk, 8? it means "crazy head" in spanish. it's not spelled with k's, though.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Some things are better left alone. I really do like the name though! Let's finally get into Smogon/Pok&eacute;mon stuff! How did you get started on Smogon? Was there another site or community that led you to Smogon</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>kind of a long story. i first found smogon on a beautiful summer day in 2009 when i was bored and looking up old pastimes. i decided to join and lurked for quite a while before making a post, and as many people do, it was an RMT. the team wasn't so great, but i realized after playing on shoddy for a while that the game was kind of fun, so i kept playing it.</p></div>
<div class="aside"><p>A loud noise from the kitchen can be heard. It sounded like a plate fell down or something. Yet, the chatter from the tables continue as if nothing happened. I quickly turn my attention back to kokoloko.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>then one day, i was on a laddering binge and got hazed something like 12 or 13 games in a row, and in my blind rage, i decided to uninstall shoddy and migrate to pok&eacute;mon online as it was getting its start-up. i spent a good year and a half there&mdash;i was the uu tier leader there too, btw&mdash;but eventually problems between me and coyotte508 led to my return to smogon alongside a bunch of people whom you probably recognize nowadays: crashinboombang, django, ginku, and a few others.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Quite interesting! How did you become the UU tier leader?</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>when i migrated back to smogon from PO, i started laddering a lot on the server and coming on IRC. there just so happened to be some open spots in the uu council at the time so jabba gave me one. a few weeks later, snunch, who was the council leader at the time, decided to quit, and since i was the most dedicated, jabba gave me the spot.</p>
<p>over time, he kind of faded into the background and i pretty much led the tier by myself, so he just passed the title on to me. :]</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>I see. Do you like how Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! is currently running? Anything you miss from Pok&eacute;mon Online?</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>yeah, i don't have any problems with the way pok&eacute;mon showdown runs at all. i do miss the sense that you get from being part of a smaller community, though. but in terms of simulator prowess, i think PS outclasses PO.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Okay, let's talk about UU! What is/was so special about this tier that made you stick with it?</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>not sure tbh, i kinda just like it lol. i think it has a lot to do with the fact that uu is kind of the most skill-intensive tier by nature. OU is a shitstorm because everyone fucking plays it and 99% of people are just bad, RU has middle-child syndrome because good players will either gravitate towards NU if they like lower tiers or stick with OU/UU, and NU attracts all the people who play the lowest tier just for the sake of being the lowest tier. not that they're inherently bad, but like i said, 99% of people are bad. OU has better players but they're never dedicated and there is no sense of community at all. so i guess it's because there is a nice balance between community and skill in the tier.</p></div>
<div class="aside"><p>A server, whose name-tag reads Hulavuta, makes his way to my table and spreads my main course over the splendid white cloth. I've never seen Italian pasta look this incredible! Oh, but I don't eat vegetables...</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>That's quite the observation, impressive. :) How is UU progressing for the time being? I see that there are many suspects yet to be tested. How long do you plan to be suspect testing, and what will happen afterward, if anything?</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>hmm, at the moment, we're voting to see which of the drops will get sent to BL, but once that ends we'll resume testing as planned. there are quite a few pok&eacute;mon yet to be tested, so my estimate is that we'll be testing for at least three or four more months. the last few tests should be pretty short because they will be obviously BL for the most part, so that saves some time.</p>
<p>once the test-everything-once phase ends, i plan to move onto testing everything a second time, but this time we'll do so in groups and perhaps with some system that allows non-council members to vote. the idea is to triple check the results and make sure we didn't make any mistakes, so i'll do as many tests and editions to the system as i need to in order to accomplish this.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>So scientific and cautious. Looks like you're looking for every other possibility that can affect a Pok&eacute;mon's tier placement. Although this is a bit of a shaky question because of how UU will be changing throughout these suspect tests, what are the most relevant and consistently strong/high-tiered Pok&eacute;mon in UU and why? And I guess I'll ask this one here because the Pok&eacute;mon may influence it: what are the most dominant playstyles?</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>hm this one's tricky because the new drops are all extremely prominent threats. i guess i'll answer twice. pre-june drops, hydreigon, mega houndoom, mega absol, honchkrow, victini, and mienshao would be my top threats. post-june drops, volcarona, mega alakazam, and lucario easily take the cake. however, funnily enough, only megazam is universally seen as broken.</p>
<p>in regard to playstyles, a lot of people think stall is the most prominent style in the tier, especially now that bliss has dropped. but i stand by this being bullshit, because stall still has way too much trouble dealing with shit like swords dance heracross, mienshao, cb victini, sableye, mew, suicune... i could keep going. every playstyle is equally viable imo. when you can pull off shit like what i did in my RMT&mdash;Empire&mdash;you know anything is possible in the tier.</p></div>
<div class="aside"><p>The server returns to pick up "finished" dishes, but is confused when both the appetizer and main dish are still completely untouched. I ensure him that it's not that I don't like the food, there just isn't time! He then walks backwards and shrugs.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Alrighty! We shall move on to fun stuff! Favorite food?</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>hmmm, i gotta say skirt steak. i'm a steak lover in general but skirt steak is fucking incredible when cooked correctly.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Quite the manly food. What's your favorite overall video game?</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>lol i'm kind of an oddball in the sense that i don't play any video games other than pok&eacute;mon.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>weirdo. Second to last: what's your favorite Pok&eacute;mon and why?</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>suicune because its design is fucking beautiful. seriously its so goddamn majestic, lol.</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>I definitely agree with that. :) Last, but not least, is :suspicious: ever going to happen???</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>lmao that. yeah, i don't know. i was pretty sure chaos was going to implement it as an emote when it was at its height, but now that it has died down, i don't see it happening. not that i would feel strongly about it either way :]</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Thank you for answering the questions! That shall be it for today. Cya around!</p></div>
<div class="interview-speaker kokoloko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue35/interview_kokoloko.png" alt="kokoloko" /><p>my pleasure, adios!</p></div>
<div class="aside"><p>We shake each other's hands and wave "bye-bye." kokoloko heads back to the kitchen to finally cook up some of his specialties. The food left on the table has been sitting around for a millennium, but I don't feel hungry anymore after the interview. I leave the food alone and pay the bill to a very confounded server. I tell them to give the food, in take-home packages, out to hungry people on the streets so they don't go to waste. Afterward, I take my leave for a very long journey home.</p>
<p>For those who have read my interviews, thank you! I will now be passing the baton to someone else, and I hope you give that new person (or recurring) a round of applause when you see 'em!</p></div>
