<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Extrasensory is hardly seen competitively. Pokemon with access to this move either don't need it for coverage, as is the case for Zoroark, or have stronger Psychic-type moves to use, as is the case for many Psychic-types. The 10% chance of a flinch is too small to warrant the use of Extrasensory over, say, Psychic, which is 10 Base Power stronger, or Psyshock, which hits the opponent's Defense stat.</p>
