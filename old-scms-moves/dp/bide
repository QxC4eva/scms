<p>Bide is a three-turn attack with +1 priority on each turn. The last Pokemon to hit the user is dealt damage on the third turn equal to double the sum of the damage dealt to the user from attacks in the first two turns. This damage is fixed, and the move will not miss, hitting Ghosts, and Pokemon using moves such as Dig and Fly. Sleep status and switching will cause the effect to end permanently.</p>
