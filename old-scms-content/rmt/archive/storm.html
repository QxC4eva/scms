<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>So yeah, I'm complete legitimacy. I have various abbreviations of my name on IRC, but the most common is c_l since I use an underscore on there. I've been playing RU since late December, and it's been my favorite metagame since. I only started playing competitive Pokemon in late July of last year, and I've gotten better as time progressed. RU is a metagame where a lot more things are viable than in the upper tiers, and there's a ton of diversity. The metagame has been balanced for months, although I think a certain vine monster has started to upset that balance. This stage of the metagame has been really fun, since while the ladder was hopelessly inactive most of the time, I still had some great battles against good players. I peaked at #3 with this team, which perfected a strategy that I like to call it FireTrap (name courtesy of DittoCrow). It's pretty similar to DragMag, but the RU version. It comes from the fact that a lot of the best special walls in RU are extremely prone to Pursuit such as Slowking, Cryogonal, and Munchlax. This is especially effective at the top of the ladder, since Slowking and Cryogonal are the main special walls used. But the cool thing is, I had been using this strategy for months without realizing it.</p>

<p>When this stage first started, I had to experiment a bit to see what worked in the new metagame and what didn't. Of course, I didn't make this team until mid-May, but when I did I could see after only a few battles how effective it was. I originally based the team around Magmortar, which at the time was the most anti-metagame Pokemon in RU. Its ability Vital Spirit made it one of the few complete counters to Tangrowth, and its access to Thunderbolt allowed it to 2HKO the impending Slowking switch-in that was dominant in the metagame. If you look closer at the title, you'll see that this team is aptly named Storm because of Magmortar and its access to Thunderbolt. I chose teammates that would be able to facilitate a Magmortar sweep easily. Choice Band Spiritomb is probably the best Pursuit user in the metagame from my experiences, and the FireTrap combo was born. Of course, Magmortar is pretty slow compared to most offensive Pokemon, and that's where I brought in an effective paralysis support core of Ferroseed and Slowking. I've used Ferroseed over Tangrowth for months because of its access to Spikes, and entry hazards are vital to this team's success. Cryogonal was the next addition for its access to Rapid Spin, especially since Cryogonal is the best spinner in RU. Finally, I needed something for Stealth Rock that would patch up the team's holes. I was doing an analysis for Rhydon at the time, and it was perfect for my team's needs.</p>

<p>I've never been entirely sure of what exactly my favored playstyle is, but I think I've found it with this team. Again, I'm not sure what exactly it classifies as, but I think it would either be semistall or bulky offense. I like having a strong defensive core to check most threats in the metagame, but at the same time I can't play full stall. I like having some offense as a way to break opposing stall, and Magmortar is one of the best candidates for the job. I typically get my hazards up as soon as possible, and against offense I take hits and paralyze while against defense I get Magmortar in and let it do its job. What I like most about this team is its flexibility, since it can easily stall for one or two hundred turns, but also it can end a battle fairly quickly. Ladder play was a piece of cake, and I ended up getting five alts in this month's 1200 stats, with of course my highest alt being at #3 earlier in the month. Now that that's out of the way, without further ado, here is Storm!</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Magmortar</strong> @ Expert Belt<br />
Ability: Vital Spirit<br />
EVs: 44 HP / 32 Def / 252 SpA / 180 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- Hidden Power Grass</p>

<p>Magmortar is the star of the team, and it was one of the most anti-metagame Pokemon there was at the time I created this team. Now, the metagame has actually started to shift around Magmortar, which is actually pretty cool. I hyped this thing up on #rarelyused for weeks, and people finally tried it out for themselves as the month went on. Magmortar is pretty much the best wallbreaker in the tier at this point in time, and the only real way to stop it is using Munchlax or a bunch of other niche counters like Grumpig, Flareon, and Camerupt. This is a set that I created, and I’ve given it to multiple other users and they’ve all had similar success with it. Expert Belt is an often-overlooked item, appearing gimmicky compared to Life Orb, and it’s forever branded to Electivire back from its time in DPP OU. However, it is put to great use here, since Magmortar also has exceptional super effective coverage. Magmortar is anti-metagame mainly because of Vital Spirit and Thunderbolt, since it can singlehandedly demolish the TanKing core without taking too much damage in the process. Focus Blast is really helpful for things like Clefable and Munchlax, and it’s also Magmortar’s best option against opposing Fire-types, bar Moltres. HP Grass is mainly for 2HKOing Lanturn after Stealth Rock, and is also helpful against certain Ground-types such as Rhydon, Quagsire, Sandslash, and Golurk. This is an original EV spread too, and I didn’t stop modifying it until the last night of the stage. Modest 180 Speed outspeeds Cryogonal and everything below, most notably Omastar and Crawdaunt. When Expert Belt gives Magmortar’s attacks a boost, Modest Expert Belt is actually slightly stronger than Timid Life Orb variants, which in my opinion are inferior to this set. Magmortar sits at a really cool Speed tier just above base 80s, but most things at or below base 80 Speed has priority to hit Magmortar with; Absol, Feraligatr, and Kabutops are what I’m talking about. Medicham can be outsped with more Speed too, but most of them are Scarfed and I’d rather not take the risk of being OHKOed by Hi Jump Kick regardless. The remaining EVs are to increase Magmortar’s bulk in a key place, and they specifically allow Magmortar to always survive no investment Tangrowth’s Earthquake after Stealth Rock, truly making it a perfect switch-in. Magmortar is what I like as an offensive Pokemon, since it still has good special bulk and can check a few troublesome threats such as Moltres and Lilligant. Anyways, Magmortar isn’t so anti-metagame anymore, but you should still be prepared for it since it’s really good.</p>

<p><strong>Spiritomb</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Shadow Sneak<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Return</p>

<p>Choice Band Spiritomb is one of my favorite Pokemon to use out of any metagame. It is just so good at what it does, and it can trap Ghosts and Psychics almost guaranteed, sometimes getting multiple kills per game. It forms the second part of my FireTrap core, and a lot of the things it can beat are roadblocks for the team such as Slowking, Rotom, and other things. RU is a tier dominated by Ghost-types such as Cofagrigus, Spiritomb, and Rotom, so Pursuit support is a godsend in this metagame. Spiritomb is arguably the best Pursuit trapper in the metagame, since it’s a Ghost-type and has Sucker Punch too. Spiritomb is a great spinblocker too, since it can trap and kill Cryogonal too, the best spinner in the metagame. No other good Ghost-type can boast that (I said good so Dusknoir doesn’t count). Sandslash has to hit three Earthquakes to kill Spiritomb, and Kabutops takes a lot from Sucker Punch if it chooses to go for Stone Edge. Spiritomb is a perfect counter to almost every Fighting-type in the metagame, since Medicham, Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, Hariyama, and Primeape can’t touch it. Usually their STAB moves are pretty predictable, but Spiritomb can easily find itself stretched thin between Pursuit trapping and countering Fighting-types. Recently, I’ve tended to not switch it in as aggressively as I have in the past, and it generally ensures that Spiritomb stays around longer. The set itself is almost standard, with the exception of Return. The deadly combo of Sucker Punch and Pursuit is pretty easy to win most of the time, and if I don’t get it right once, then I definitely will the second time. Shadow Sneak is what I use against Rotom, Jynx, Haunter, and other frail Pokemon, since they can all punish the use of Sucker Punch with Substitute, or Lovely Kiss in Jynx’s case. Double priority is a great insurance against frail offensive Pokemon such as Manectric, Accelgor, and Scpetile, since Spiritomb can take them all out with Sucker Punch before it dies to a strong STAB move. Most Choice Band Spiritomb use Trick, and I originally did as well. However, my team is incredibly weak to Crawdaunt, and I needed some way to break its Substitutes before it could set up. It found other uses as well by being more powerful than Shadow Sneak, and locking yourself into Sucker Punch unless absolutely necessary isn’t a good idea. With Return, Spiritomb can also check Taunt + SD Drapion since it isn’t OHKOed by Crunch and can deal a good deal of damage with Pursuit. The EVs outspeed Dusknoir before it can use Will-o-Wisp, but Dusknoir isn’t that common or good so it doesn’t come in handy that often. I see people using this set with Will-O-Wisp over Trick and with BlackGlasses, and I just shake my head because Pursuit can’t OHKO Slowking or Cryogonal on the switch.</p>

<p><strong>Ferroseed</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Iron Barbs<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Leech Seed<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Gyro Ball</p>

<p>Ferroseed is a Pokemon that I’ve used on pretty much every successful team I’ve ever made for this metagame. Every time, it hasn’t disappointed. This is the only Ferroseed set worth using, and even with Protect you lose a valuable moveslot that makes Ferroseed setup fodder. Well, you could drop Spikes, but at that point you should be using Tangrowth. As for me, I’ve always preferred Ferroseed because I really like Spikes in RU, since a lot of the most threatening attackers take full damage from entry hazards. Ferroseed isn’t liked by a lot of the top players, but I’ve always been able to use it successfully. In my opinion, the key to using Ferroseed is to keep using Thunder Wave. Most players think that Ferroseed is a free switch-in for pretty much anything, but Thunder Wave deters things like Moltres, Magmortar, and Entei from doing much. Ferroseed can switch in easily on Water-types, and also many Normal-types as well. Against offensive teams, I’m spamming Thunder Wave since if I’m switching in Ferroseed it usually means I wall whatever my opponent has in. Against defensive teams, I’m either laying down Spikes or using Leech Seed to get a healthy recovery method going. Things like Steelix and Sandslash that can actually hit Ferroseed with Earthquake are usually Leech Seeded, whereas Choice-locked Electric-type attacks are getting Spikes set up on them. Gyro Ball is completely necessary so that Ferroseed isn’t destroyed by Taunt and Gyro Ball actually finds a fair bit of use against Aerodactyl and Whimsicott, which are both hard countered by Ferroseed. Sap Sipper users such as Bouffalant and Sawsbuck are hit hard by Gyro Ball, breaking both of their Substitutes. It’s always funny to me when people try to bring in Golurk on Ferroseed, since the only way that Ferroseed will be significantly damaged is by Focus Punch, but Gyro Ball breaks Golurk’s Substitutes so Golurk can’t get the Focus Punch off. A physically defensive spread is completely necessary for Ferroseed, and allows it to counter Feraligatr and Kabutops, among other things. I’ve never even considered a specially defensive spread, since the only notable special attack that Ferroseed needs to survive is +2 Omastar’s Ice Beam, but Ferroseed only loses about two-thirds of its health when using a physically defensive spread. I would consider more attack to break Crawdaunt’s Substitutes. But I’m sure it’s way too much investment than for what it’s worth. The only other thing that’s slightly annoyed me is how Aerodactyl can live a Gyro Ball with only 2%, and I always get a low damage roll on it. All the same, Ferroseed is an excellent defensive pivot that is one of the better Spikers in the metagame.</p>

<p><strong>Slowking</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 144 Def / 116 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Scald<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Psyshock<br />
- Slack Off</p>

<p>This is a pretty standard defensive set, and Slowking is just so good at what it does. It uses its resistances and bulk to check/counter most Fire- and Fighting-types easily. I’ve used it a lot in this metagame, and it forms an effective defensive core with Ferroseed, and there’s few things that they can’t handle. Slowking first rose into prominence when Moltres burst out onto the scene as a major threat, and Slowking was its best common counter since it had Regenerator and Slack Off. I’ve used Slowking on a lot of teams, and it always gets the job done. The defensive set is definitely the best, since once you know that it’s a Specs set, it’s really quite easy to switch into. However, the defensive set packs an element of surprise, since you don’t always know what its second attacking move is; Fire Blast is bad for Ferroseed, while Psyshock is bad for Cryogonal. I originally went with Psychic to deal with Qwilfish and Poliwrath better, but I soon found that Psyshock was the better option. It’s mainly for Cryogonal, but it also works better against Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, and Gallade. It lets it serve as a secondary check to Bulk Up Gallade, which can be problematic if it gets too many boosts and Spiritomb is down. It’s completely superior to Psychic, since it still hurts Qwilfish and Poliwrath. Scald is Slowking’s primary STAB move though, since the burn chance is really nice. Being able to catch a Drapion or Spiritomb on the switch is really cool, and it makes Slowking a lot harder to take down. I’ve use Surf in the past to deal with Moltres and SubCM Entei better, but I really prefer Scald. One of the cool things about hitting both physically and specially with the same Special Attack stat is that if a 40% Cofagrigus switches in and takes 18% from Psyshock, I can easily go for the KO with Scakd since Cofagrigus’s Defense is higher than its Special Defense. Like with Ferroseed, if I expect something slightly problematic switching in, every day I’m using Thunder Wave. It really is the key to this team’s success, and since there are few viable clerics in RU (Lanturn, Clefable, Uxie) it cripples them for the rest of the match. Slack Off has been traditionally deemed a necessity for Slowking, but most matches I don’t even use it. Of course, I could replace it with Fire Blast, but I think there are more times that I need Slack Off than I would need Fire Blast. It’s really only helpful for Tangrowth and Ferroseed, but they usually aren’t too threatening. The EV spread is pretty standard, since it has enough Defense EVs to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Entei, and the rest are placed in Special Defense. Slowking has high usage for a reason, since it’s a wonderful pivot.</p>

<p><strong>Cryogonal</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Haze<br />
- Recover<br />
- Ice Beam</p>

<p>Cryogonal is the best spinner in RU, and it only moved into RU this month. It can beat pretty much every spinblocker in the tier, since it hard counters Cofagrigus and Rotom, can beat Calm Mind Spiritomb, and also beats Golurk. The only good spinblocker that it can’t beat all of the time is Choice Band Spiritomb, since Dusknoir is bad. But even then, SilentVerse has been using a spread that let Cryogonal beat even Spiritomb, since it only needs a certain amount of Defense EVs to always survive either a Sucker Punch or Pursuit on the switch. Cryogonal is great against spike-stacking teams, since they typically only carry Cofagrigus or Rotom as their spinblockers, and Cryogonal is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. It is also a good special wall, since it has reliable recovery, a good defensive typing for a special wall, and of course that high Special Defense. It has great utility in countering some of the threats that Slowking can’t handle, such as Sceptile, Manectric, Rotom, and Rotom-C. It’s one of the best counters in the metagame to Trick Room + Nasty Plot Cofagrigus, and it’s the main reason why I chose Haze over Toxic. Ice Beam is surprisingly powerful, dealing a good chunk of damage to most things that don’t resist it. It’s one of my go-to options for Sigilyph, although it immediately wins if it has Psyshock. However, only Life Orb variants carry Psyshock, and those are easily dealt with by Spiritomb. Cryogonal is weak to Stealth Rock, which isn’t really desirable as a spinner, since Cryogonal is easily forced out because of its awful Defense stat. This is most definitely the standard set for Cryogonal though, since it combines its utility as a spinner and a special wall into one. A pretty simple max/max spread lets it take on special attackers as best as possible, while not being susceptible to setup sweepers because of Haze. Haze is one of the best things Cryogonal has going for it, and it makes it different from things like Slowking and Lanturn. Say, did Shadow Ball just cause a Special Defense drop? No big deal, just stay in and use Haze, and then the Ghost-type is beaten down. Cryogonal is finally getting the usage it deserves, since it’s been the best spinner in RU for quite some time.</p>

<p><strong>Rhydon</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Lightningrod<br />
EVs: 60 HP / 252 Atk / 16 Def / 56 SpD / 124 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Rock Blast<br />
- Megahorn</p>

<p>And now, the mighty Rhydon comes into play, one of the most underrated Pokemon in RU. Rhydon is the glue of the team, since it offers many helpful resistances, insurance against many threats, and some nice offensive presence to go along with Stealth Rock. I face a lot of teams that are weak to it, since people tend to lack Ground resists on their team because there aren’t any prominent RU threats with STAB Earthquake. Rhydon was thrown onto the team mainly because of the above reasons, but it turned out to be anti-metagame as well. It’s a great lead, since it can beat most other hazard leads with Rock Blast, and can even set up Stealth Rock of its own. All those Aerodactyls, Scolipedes, Accelgors, and Crustles got nothing on Rhydon. It is literally the best feeling in the world to OHKO Crustle since it needs five hits and a crit to actually happen. Anyways, Rhydon is my primary way of beating special walls such as Miltank, Clefable, and Munchlax that Magmortar can’t switch into very easily. It tanks Earthquakes like it’s its job and deals heavy damage in return. Honestly, I think that Rhydon is one of the most underrated Pokemon in RU, since it has few hard counters due to its bulk, power, and coverage. It’s one of the best Drapion counter in the tier, since only a +2 Aqua Tail really hurts it enough, and even then Drapion needs a Life Orb to guarantee the OHKO. Megahorn is one of Rhydon’s greatest assets in my opinion, since it can deal over 80% to unsuspecting Slowkings and also allows it to be a low-health Tangrowth. It hits lead Mesprit for an OHKO most of the time, while Rhydon easily lives an Ice Beam. It’s also good for hitting things like Crawdaunt and Sceptile on the switch, since they can both be pretty threatening if played correctly. Now, Rhydon’s spread looks incredibly complicated, and I’m not gonna tell you that it’s actually quite simple because it’s not. Max Attack is obvious, while 124 Speed outruns the rare support Omastar that Double01 uses. The HP and Special Defense allow Rhydon to take on Life Orb Rotom, since its Shadow Ball doesn’t even 2HKO, while the rest is placed in Defense since it increases physical bulk more than placing it in HP would. Rhydon is a great Pokemon that plays numerous roles for a team, and it really shines with the support this team gives it.</p>
