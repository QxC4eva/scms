[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 100% chance to lower the target's Speed by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>For the most part, Mud Shot should not be used competitively since it is weak. However, the secondary effect to lower the target's Speed is desirable for some Pokemon to turn a potential check switching in into a non-threat. Other than this, however, one should always use Earth Power.</p>
