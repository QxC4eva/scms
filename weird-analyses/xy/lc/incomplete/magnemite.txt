Overview
########

Last generation, Magnemite was an effective bulky attacker who could switch into things like the threatening SubRoost Murkrow and take it out, and in this generation, it can still take hits while hitting back, thanks to a niche item + ability combo. Sadly, Steel lost it's resistance to Ghost, making it a less reliable counter to things like Drifloon, and Dark, meaning things like Pawniard can punish it with their STAB. In addition, Magnemite heavily relies on items, so the Knock Off buff has greatly hurt it. Not all is dark for Magnemite though, as Steel is now super effective against the new Fairy type, meaning it can counter or check things like Spiritzee and Snubbull. It was also given a gift with the unbanning of Berry Juice, allowing it to be a top notch abuser of the infamous Berry Juice and Sturdy combo. Although no where near as effective as last generation, it's Choice Scarf set can still function as a solid revenge killer. It's typing still allows it to function as a good pivot for offensive teams, with it's ability to Volt Switch out of threats, absorb Paralyses, and keep great pressure on the opponent with it's solid coverage.

Use it to bait in things such as Gligar, survive a hit, and OHKO back, or use it to switch in to things that do over 50% and force them to have to 2HKO you without getting KO'd
Avoid switching into Knock Off users
Remove Spikes and Stealth Rocks before coming in too keep Sturdy intact
