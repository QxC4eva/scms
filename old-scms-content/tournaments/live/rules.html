<h2><a name="point">Point System</a></h2>
<p>A leaderboard of points is kept for the Smogon Live Tournaments. After the three month season is over, the top 8 players move on to a double elimination tournament in which matches are the best 2 out of 3 of the three metagames for that season. Players can't lose points except by being disqualified, and gain points based on how they fair in the weekly tournaments they participate in. For most tournaments, 5 points are given for first, 3 for second, 2 for top 4, and 1 for top 8. Instead 3 points are given for first, 2 for second, and 1 for third or top four depending on the tournament style, if there are less than 12 players.</p>
