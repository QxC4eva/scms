<p>My sis and I greeting the Danish crown prince/princess at the airport. She gave them flowers and I had to gave them two cuddly toys for their kids (a koala and the ugliest emu I've ever seen in my life).

I'm not really a fan of monarchies (I don't see why someone should be born into a position like that), but they seemed nice. And how can you I say no to an opportunity to suit up?</p>

<p>A year and a half ago, when I shaved my head (and *cringes* waxed my legs) for charity. Turns out I have the skull of an alien, but I raised $700 for the Leukemia Foundation, so totally worth it!</p>

<p>Besides, when you just so happen to be bald, why not take advantage of it? I am somewhat of a photobomb enthusiast after all :P</p>
