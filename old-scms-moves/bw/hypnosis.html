Puts the target to sleep.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Puts the target to sleep. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Pokemon with the abilities Insomnia or Vital Spirit are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Hypnosis has little competitive use. While the sleep status is powerful, Hypnosis's accuracy is too low, and too unreliable in most situations. However, there are times when the risk of missing with Hypnosis is worth it. The best example is with Substitute Gengar; behind a Substitute, Gengar has a "free turn" with which to try and put the opponent to sleep with Hypnosis, very quickly turning the tides of the battle to its favor. Gengar is also so fast that, even if it misses the first Hypnosis from behind the Substitute, Gengar will usually have a chance to try hitting the opponent with Hypnosis again with statistically higher odds.</p>
