Overview
########

Torchic has always been an underwhelming Pokemon in LC, and last generation its hidden ability went unreleased. However, this generation finally allowed Speed Boost Torchic to become reality, and made it the only Speed Boost Pokemon in LC to also have Baton Pass. This coupled with its surprising bulk allowed it to become a notable part of the metagame.

Moves

========

 Baton Pass is obvious and serves to pass the garnered boosts around to the rest of the team.

 Protect is the crucial move used mainly in order to get the minimum one speed boost. It also allows you to scout and protect yourself from Fake Out.

 Fire Blast is the optimal STAB move, due to solid power output and preventing Torchic from being Taunt bait. Fire STAB's utility in the metagame also means that Torchic can clean late game.

 Swords Dance is generally the final move, using Torchic's surprising physical bulk in order to optimally get a +2 Atk +2 Spe passed to a target on your team.


Set Details

========

 The massive investment in defense allows Torchic to tank some surprising moves, notably Gligar Earthquake. Maximum Speed allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame at +1

 Eviolite is the item of choice due to it increasing vital bulk

 Bold to maximize physical bulk and thus set up opportunities.

Usage Tips

========

 Torchic is best used on Pokemon that cannot OHKO it or Pokemon that cannot interfere with Torchic's set up.

 Do not lead with it as the opponent will generally use something to answer to it.

 It is best paired with Pokemon that can take a hit after the pass, have an immunity to Torchic's weaknesses, have Baton Pass, or have high power output.



Team Options

========

 Gligar is an excellent partner due to its immunity to Ground, and it also has Baton Pass. Meditite also has solid bulk with Eviolite, and has access to Baton Pass.

 Generally the best partners for Torchic are Pokemon that have Baton Pass or can immediately benefit from the passed boosts.



Other Options

########

 It can also pass a couple other boosts: Hone Claws and Focus Energy.

 a niche option is flame charge, as it is boosted by Swords Dance and makes it get speed even faster. using flame charge means you must move the special attack EVs to attack and change the nature to Impish.

 it can also support the team with Will-o-Wisp



Checks & Counters
########

 Pokemon carrying a phazing move are pretty much hard counters to what Torchic does. Notable ones are Munchlax and Vullaby.

 Priority can mess up Torchic if it is in range of KO from the said priority, thus checking Torchic.

 Taunt: any Taunt user that can take a Fire Blast can shut down Torchic as well, such as Taunt Gligar.
