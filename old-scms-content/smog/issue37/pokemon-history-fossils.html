<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Throughout the generations, there have been several Pok&eacute;mon introduced as fossils of beings that existed in ancient times. While the spotlight is often cast on Pok&eacute;mon that exist naturally throughout the many regions of the Pok&eacute;mon world, there are those that have long since expired from nature but have been given a second chance at life by way of the scientific ingenuity that is fossil revival. This article will cover all of the fossil Pok&eacute;mon introduced over the generations of Pok&eacute;mon games and how they fit into competitive battling in each of their evolutionary stages. Special thanks to Soulgazer, Montsegur, and Arikado for assisting with information for this project.</p>

<h2>Fossils of Kanto</h2>
<p>RBY brought forth the first set of fossils: the <b>Helix Fossil</b>, the <b>Dome Fossil</b>, and the <b>Old Amber</b>. The former two are found in the northern part of the Kanto region within Mt. Moon, a mysterious cavern said to have been formed by falling meteors in ancient times. The fact that the Pok&eacute;mon these two fossils are derived from were sea-dwellers (as well as Water-types) from the past suggests that Mt. Moon was long ago filled with water and marine life at one point, or at least the underground parts of it. One of these fossils, of the player's choice, is obtainable from a Super Nerd trainer in the cavern after defeating him. It can be safely assumed that he is the one who discovered the fossils within Mt. Moon, as it is stated that Team Rocket was also searching for them there so they could sell them for cash. The Old Amber fossil is revealed to have been discovered by a scientist who helps out at the Pewter City Museum, but the actual origins of this fossil are unknown. The place where all three of these fossils can be revived is none other than the laboratory on Cinnabar Island, headed by the renowned Dr. Fuji&mdash;the director of the band of scientists responsible for the creation of Mewtwo.</p>

</div>
<h3>- Omanyte &amp; Omastar -</h3>
<p><b>Omanyte's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Spiral Pok&eacute;mon) A prehistoric Pok&eacute;mon that lived in the primordial sea, it swims by twisting its 10 tentacles about.</p>
<p><b>Omanyte's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Spiral Pok&eacute;mon) Revived from an ancient fossil, this Pok&eacute;mon uses air stored in its shell to sink and rise in water.</p>
<p>Competitively, Omanyte is a special Shell Smash sweeper in Little Cup that was outclassed by Clamperl until the XY era began. Knock Off's buff decreased the viability of Clamperl because it relies on its DeepSeaTooth item to be effective, and the rise of Fletchling made Omanyte's Rock typing a much more valuable asset than before. After using Shell Smash, Omanyte has enough power to OHKO Eviolite Mienfoo with Hydro Pump and OHKO Foongus with Ice Beam as well after hazard damage; it is a force to be reckoned with but must be wary of Fighting-types, especially ones with priority attacks such as Croagunk and Timburr. The increase in Omanyte's usage has also contributed to Grass-type coverage moves finding viable use on important Little Cup Pok&eacute;mon such as Abra and Zigzagoon. Omanyte can also run an effective hazard set with its solid defensive typing, supreme physical bulk, and access to all entry hazards bar Sticky Web. It ran a Swift Swim set under rain in DPP Little Cup before Shell Smash existed.</p>

<p><b>Omastar's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Spiral Pok&eacute;mon) Its tentacles are highly developed as if they are hands and feet. As soon as it ensnares prey, it bites.</p>
<p><b>Omastar's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Spiral Pok&eacute;mon) Once wrapped around its prey, it never lets go. It eats the prey by tearing at it with sharp fangs.</p>
<p>Omastar is capable of running an excellent hazard lead set in RU, thanks to its ability to destroy common Defog users such as Gligar and physically defensive Golbat. Omastar also has access to Weak Armor, which increases Omastar's low base Speed upon being struck by a physical attack. This ability enables Timid Omastar to set up an extra entry hazard against naturally faster opponents, such as Drapion and Gallade. Omastar is also very good on OU rain teams, where its Choice Specs set is capable of luring and 2HKOing standard Ferrothorn. Choice Specs Omastar is so lethal, it usually OHKOes even Greninja from full health. Omastar was one of the premier offensive threats in Ubers last generation when permanent rain existed, due to its ability to OHKO Extreme Killer and Ghost Arceus after Stealth Rock as well as check Ho-Oh under rainy conditions. Omastar also ran effective Shell Smash sets last generation in every tier from RU to Ubers.</p>

	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/kabutops.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<h3>- Kabuto &amp; Kabutops -</h3>
<p><b>Kabuto's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Shellfish Pok&eacute;mon) It is thought to have inhabited beaches 300 million years ago. It is protected by a stiff shell.</p>
<p><b>Kabuto's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Shellfish Pok&eacute;mon) This Pokémon was regenerated from the fossil of an ancient creature. It protects itself with a hard shell.</p>
<p>Kabuto fills a niche in Little Cup as a Rapid Spin user that can check Fletchling. While it doesn't have access to Shell Smash like some of the other Rock- and Water-type threats in the tier, its respectable Attack and Defense stats combined with its important Flying resistance and ability to rid its team of hazards makes it worth considering for use. Access to STAB Aqua Jet also allows Kabuto to check Archen and Drilbur, two of the metagame's most common hazard control Pok&eacute;mon, and it beats them both one on one if it comes down to that, as long as Kabuto isn't significantly damaged already. Like Omanyte, Kabuto must be wary of Pok&eacute;mon that carry Fighting- and Electric-type attacks, and it is especially weak to Grass-type attacks.</p>

<p><b>Kabutops's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Shellfish Pok&eacute;mon) In the water, it tucks in its limbs to become more compact, then it wiggles its shell to swim fast.</p>
<p><b>Kabutops's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Shellfish Pok&eacute;mon) A slim and fast swimmer. It slices its prey with its sharp sickles and drinks the body fluids.</p>
<p>Kabutops has dropped to NU this generation, largely because Rapid Spin holds less importance now that Defog has been buffed to remove hazards from both sides of the playing field. Even despite this, Kabutops functions well as an offensive Rapid Spin user in several tiers from RU on up and also works as a potent rain sweeper in OU and Ubers. Waterfall and Stone Edge give Kabutops a pair of powerful STAB moves to deal massive damage to the majority of the NU tier, and it has Superpower and Knock Off to punish Ferroseed and Ghost-types, respectively. Kabutops is great on OU rain teams due to its ability to clean house with its rain-boosted STAB Waterfall. Most rain teams there run Kabutops because of its 508 Speed under Rain; it is also notable that it can move before Talonflame's Brave Bird and Thundurus's Thunder Wave with Aqua Jet. Like Omastar, Kabutops was much better last generation when permanent rain existed, but in XY, it can still be a great offensive and supportive Pok&eacute;mon in just about every tier there is. Kabutops competitively outclasses many of the fossil-based Pok&eacute;mon that were created later.</p>

	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/aerodactyl-mega.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<h3>- Aerodactyl &amp; Mega Aerodactyl -</h3>
<p><b>Aerodactyl's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Fossil Pok&eacute;mon) It was regenerated from a dinosaur's genetic matter that was found in amber. It flies with high-pitched cries.</p>
<p><b>Aerodactyl's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Fossil Pok&eacute;mon) This vicious Pok&eacute;mon is said to have flown in ancient skies while shrieking high-pitched cries.</p>
<p>Behold, the only known fossil Pok&eacute;mon in existence to have a Mega Evolution. Last generation, Aerodactyl was a reliable Stealth Rock setter and revenge killer in RU due to its extremely good 130 base Speed and reasonable 105 base Attack. This generation, the Aerodactylite pushes those to an insane 150 and 135, respectively. Mega Aerodactyl is now a top threat in XY UU, with its blistering Speed allowing it to revenge kill even neutral-natured 90 base Speed Pok&eacute;mon equipped with a Choice Scarf. Its ability, Tough Claws, boosts the power of its contact moves, and although Aerodactyl doesn't get any great STAB moves to abuse this ability (Aerial Ace is its best bet), it can use Aqua Tail, Crunch, Fire Fang, Pursuit, Iron Tail, and Ice Fang with this boost if it so chooses. Furthermore, Aerodactyl can utilize a combination of Taunt and Roost alongside two attacks to aggravate stall teams, and it also has access to the improved Defog, which allows it to use its high Speed to reliably clear entry hazards for its team. Though most commonly seen in UU, Aerodactyl is very good in OU as well due to its ability to check dangerous threats such as Talonflame and revenge kill the likes of Greninja. It's also a respectable force in the VGC scene, where its 150 base Speed and access to Rock Slide means that both of the opponent's Pok&eacute;mon usually have a reasonable chance of flinching if Mega Aerodactyl uses this move, which makes it frustrating to face.</p>

</div>
<h2>Fossils of Hoenn</h2>
<p>Skipping over the Johto region, as there are no known Pok&eacute;mon fossils found there, here are the <b>Root Fossil</b> and the <b>Claw Fossil</b>. These fossils are found in the secluded desert area on Route 111 in the Hoenn region. Scientific evidence points to this desert area having been a sea basin in the ancient past, which would make the Pok&eacute;mon these fossils are derived from aquatic in origin like Kabuto and Omanyte. In light of that, it is ironic that neither of these Hoenn fossils are of Water-type Pok&eacute;mon. One is actually a dormant, parasitic plant-like being, and the other is an armored insect. The developer of the machine that revives these Pok&eacute;mon is an employee of the Devon Corporation in Rustboro City, and his fossil-reviving machine is shown to be the only project to have success of all the inventions developed in their building.</p>


<div class="align-center">
	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/lileep.gif" alt="" />
	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/cradily.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<h3>- Lileep &amp; Cradily -</h3>
<p><b>Lileep's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Sea Lily Pok&eacute;mon) It disguises its tentacles as flowers to attract and catch prey. It became extinct in ancient times.</p>
<p><b>Lileep's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Sea Lily Pok&eacute;mon) It lived on the seafloor 100 million years ago and was reanimated scientifically.</p>
<p>With its unique typing and Storm Drain ability, Lileep is a staple on sand teams in Little Cup. Its ability to switch easily into Water-type moves for a Special Attack boost while taking no damage makes the opponent think twice before trying to exploit the Water weakness of Hippopotas and Drilbur. Lileep's bulk, in combination with access to Recover, makes it one of the few viable users of Toxic in the Little Cup metagame, able to stall out a large number of threats by badly poisoning them and then spamming Recover or Giga Drain. Unfortunately, the rise of the improved Knock Off and the nerf to weather in XY have greatly decreased its effectiveness. Sand teams aren't nearly as prominent as they were when Sand Stream brought permanent sand, and Lileep's ability to tank hits and stall out foes is considerably hampered by having its Eviolite removed. It's still a good answer to Chinchou, Carvanha, and other Water-types, as well as opposing Drilbur, but the ever-present Fighting-types and Knock Off generally keep it from accomplishing much now. It has truly fallen from grace in the transition from BW to XY.</p>

<p><b>Cradily's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Barnacle Pok&eacute;mon) It lives in the shallows of warm seas. When the tide goes out, it digs up prey from beaches.</p>
<p><b>Cradily's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Barnacle Pok&eacute;mon) It ensnares prey with its eight tentacles. It then melts the prey with a strong acid before feeding.</p>
<p>Cradily takes a similar approach in the NU tier this generation but does not require sand support and Eviolite to be effective. Its great all-around bulk, especially on the special side, allows it to stall reliably with Recover while wearing down enemies with Toxic poison, as Lileep does. Additionally, Cradily is able to check most special attackers in NU with the threat of hitting back for double damage with Mirror Coat. It is even able to counter the likes of Lilligant, Lanturn, Exeggutor, Gorebyss, Pyroar, and Rotom-S. Cradily is also usable in RU, where it reliably sets up Stealth Rock and checks Exploud and Water-types. Amazingly, Cradily is actually capable of taking two Fire Blasts from Life Orb Moltres, making it an effective counter with full health and maximum special bulk. Cradily doesn't have very much viable use outside of these two tiers, but is a solid Pok&eacute;mon as long as it sticks to the metagames it can handle.</p>


<div class="align-center">
	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/anorith.gif" alt="" />
	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/armaldo.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<h3>- Anorith &amp; Armaldo -</h3>
<p><b>Anorith's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Old Shrimp Pok&eacute;mon) It is a kind of Pokémon progenitor. It uses its extending claws to catch prey hiding among rocks on the seafloor.</p>
<p><b>Anorith's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Old Shrimp Pok&eacute;mon) A Pok&eacute;mon ancestor that was reanimated from a fossil. It lived in the sea and hunted with claws.</p>
<p>Anorith has one of the highest Attack stats in Little Cup, with Swords Dance to push it through the roof, as well as good STAB attacks and Knock Off to dish out the pain. It has access to Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin and also has Swift Swim to allow it to become a rain sweeper. However, even with all these gifts, it is unfortunately held back by a myriad of factors. The attacking combination of Rock + Bug + Dark is totally resisted by Fighting-types, which are incredibly common in Little Cup and found on almost every good team. Additionally, rain is the only weather in the metagame that does not have a Pok&eacute;mon with an auto-weather ability to set it up, making it difficult to successfully sweep with Swift Swim. Dwebble outclasses Anorith in a hazard setting role, and the fact that it is weak to Stealth Rock makes it unappealing as a spinner on top of that. Lastly, Anorith's typing is severely lacking in the defensive department, having resistances to only Normal and Poison, arguably the two worst coverage types in the game. As a result, it's hard to justify using Anorith on a serious Little Cup team despite its strong points.</p>

<p><b>Armaldo's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Plate Pok&eacute;mon) Its enormous, retractable claws can cut through most anything. Its entire body is clad in sturdy plates.</p>
<p><b>Armaldo's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Plate Pok&eacute;mon) Protected by a hard shell, its body is very sturdy. It skewers prey with its claws to feed.</p>
<p>Armaldo has similar problems in the NU tier, where its existence there can be likened to that of Claydol and Hitmonchan in the current RU tier—outclassed but still used enough to maintain its tier spot. Sadly, almost everything Armaldo can do in NU is done better by its fossil cousin Kabutops, which can make it hard to find use among better players. Armaldo can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, but its typing causes it to take maximum damage from those before it can get rid of them, which means that it can be knocked out before using Rapid Spin a lot of the time. Kabutops has a much better offensive typing for sweeping in rain, including a very important Water-type STAB, which Armaldo does not have. What Armaldo does have over Kabutops is the ability to take on Grass-types with its Bug-type STAB. It also has a bit more Attack and doesn't have the weaknesses to Fighting, Ground, Electric, and Grass that Kabutops is cursed with. However, it usually ends up not being enough, and so Armaldo is usually forgone in favor of the blade-endowed shellfish.</p>

<h2>Fossils of Sinnoh</h2>
<p>The fossils of the Sinnoh region are unique in that they are found in what is known as The Underground, an area beneath the surface of the earth that is accessible from almost any overworld location in Sinnoh after obtaining the Explorer's Kit. Interestingly enough, the fossils of Sinnoh represent how you use your head... literally. The <b>Skull Fossil</b>, exclusive to Diamond Version, resurrects a Pok&eacute;mon that uses its head as a weapon, while the <b>Armor Fossil</b>, only available to Pearl Version, yields one that uses its head as a shield. In Platinum, only one or the other will be obtainable, depending on the final digit of the player's Trainer ID number; an odd number will cause Skull Fossils to appear in The Underground, while an even number will generate Armor Fossils. Both of these fossils can be revived at the Oreburgh Mining Museum, in southwestern Sinnoh.</p>


<div class="align-center">
	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/cranidos.gif" alt="" />
	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/rampardos.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<h3>- Cranidos &amp; Rampardos -</h3>
<p><b>Cranidos's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Head Butt Pok&eacute;mon) It was resurrected from an iron ball-like fossil. It downs prey with its headbutts.</p>
<p><b>Cranidos's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Head Butt Pok&eacute;mon) A lifelong jungle dweller from 100 million years ago, it would snap obstructing trees with headbutts.</p>
<p>Cranidos has the absolute highest Attack stat in all of Little Cup, even including all of the Little Cup eligible Pok&eacute;mon that were banned. It also has access to two incredible abilities to back that massive power as it tears through the opposition. Sheer Force tacks on an additional power boost to its Rock Slide, Crunch, and Zen Headbutt attacks, which is increased even further if used with Life Orb. Mold Breaker, on the other hand, allows Cranidos to OHKO Pok&eacute;mon that rely on Sturdy to survive any hit, such as Magnemite and Tirtouga. However, even with this outstanding offensive prowess, Cranidos does have its limitations. Its Rock typing gives it weaknesses to common attacking types, and Fighting- and Ground-types can usually switch into its STAB attacks and turn the tables on it with little trouble. Being weak to priority moves like Aqua Jet and Vacuum Wave also sets it back and keeps it from sweeping. Its mediocre Speed also leaves it outsped by many relevant Pok&eacute;mon, so its best bet at using its great power to get anything done is by either holding a Choice Scarf or being on a team that utilizes Sticky Web, but it will still require good prediction on the player's part to be effective.</p>

<p><b>Rampardos's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Head Butt Pok&eacute;mon) Its skull withstands impacts of any magnitude. As a result, its brain never gets the chance to grow.</p>
<p><b>Rampardos's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Head Butt Pok&eacute;mon) Its skull is as hard as iron, it is a brute that tears down jungle trees while catching prey.</p>
<p>Rampardos's approach is very similar to that of Cranidos, but with even more raw destructive power. 165 base Attack is what makes Rampardos a Pok&eacute;mon to be feared; any physical attack from it on even a neutral target will severely hurt. However, its subpar Speed and bulk combined with its handful of weaknesses to common attacking types renders it largely nonviable in higher tiers. It is used in XY NU as a Focus Sash-equipped lead that breaks through opposing Crustle leads with its Rock-type STAB and Mold Breaker, which hits home on its Rock weakness and also ignores Sturdy, assuring that no entry hazards are set. Lead Rampardos sets also usually include Endeavor for bringing an enemy to low health after taking a big hit, so that a teammate can finish them off. It also carries Stealth Rock of its own and doesn't have to worry about Xatu's Magic Bounce deflecting it back because Mold Breaker negates that. Rampardos gets the all-powerful Head Smash as well as strong coverage moves to nail the types that wall its STAB, such as Earthquake, Superpower, and Zen Headbutt. Mixed Rampardos sets with Ice Beam or Fire Blast can also work with Sheer Force and Life Orb for a surprise special hit against physical walls that may give Rampardos trouble, such as Torterra. If it's supported by some form of speed control, usually Sticky Web or Choice Scarf, it can afford to be played more recklessly, but that doesn't eliminate Rampardos's defensive issues if it has to take a hit. All in all, it's an insanely powerful Pok&eacute;monand will definitely do massive damage, but it usually comes with a high cost that lots of players aren't so happy about, which is why its usage has landed it in NU.</p>


<div class="align-center">
	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/shieldon.gif" alt="" />
	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/bastiodon.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<h3>- Shieldon &amp; Bastiodon -</h3>
<p><b>Shieldon's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Shield Pok&eacute;mon) It habitually polishes its face by rubbing it against tree trunks. It is weak to attacks from behind.</p>
<p><b>Shieldon's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Shield Pok&eacute;mon) It was generated from a fossil dug out of a layer of clay that was older than anyone knows. It has a sturdy face.</p>
<p>Shieldon's approach is just as it would appear to be: highly defensive. Where its Sinnoh-based fossil brother Cranidos uses its head as a weapon, Shieldon uses its head as the total opposite, and is designed to shrug off attacks. Unfortunately, Shieldon isn't capable of very much in Little Cup, though it makes for a reliable Stealth Rock setter with its huge defenses and Sturdy ability to assure that it survives any one attack; the only problem is that Aron is a better choice for this exact role. Its typing allows it to counter and totally beat Fletchling, which is significant, but there are better Pok&eacute;mon that can do that as well. At its best, Shieldon is able to 2HKO Spritzee with Heavy Slam, and it also has Rock Blast to smash most Defog users for super effective damage. However, even with these things in consideration, it is simply outclassed in just about everything it can do and isn't very viable when other Steel-types such as Aron and Pawniard exist.</p>

<p><b>Bastiodon's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Shield Pok&eacute;mon) When they lined up side by side, no foe could break through. They shielded their young in that way.</p>
<p><b>Bastiodon's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Shield Pok&eacute;mon) Any frontal attack is repulsed. It is a docile Pokémon that feeds on grass and berries.</p>
<p>As opposed to its fossil counterpart Rampardos, Bastiodon uses its head as a shield, and, as its appearance would suggest, it is also therefore a very defensive Pok&eacute;mon in battle. While it isn't very offensively threatening, it is designed to be the ultimate tank; one that not only takes hits extremely well, but is also immune to Toxic and is capable of punishing enemies by countering their attacks with Metal Burst, and it has many support options at its disposal as well. However, having a typing that's 4x weak to Ground and Fighting, two common attacking types, neutralizes its defensive purpose to a substantial degree, and to make matters worse, what really shuts Bastiodon down is its susceptibility to Taunt, which prevents it from using its bulk to get off its support moves; it was cursed with low usage last generation as a result, and that same fate continues now. Metal Burst is very effective in that it punishes both physical and special attacks, but it's easy to play around for even decent battlers in most cases, and so it usually forgone in favor of more reliable supporters.</p>

</div>
<h2>Fossils of Unova</h2>
<p>The <b>Cover Fossil</b> and <b>Plume Fossil</b> of the Unova region are without question the most mysterious of all the fossils, as their origins are completely unknown and unexplained. These two fossils are not obtainable anywhere naturally in-game in BW and can only be received from a backpacker found in the first floor of the Relic Castle in the underground area of the Desert Resort, who claims that the fossils are too heavy and offers the player one of them to lighten his load. The backpacker describes the Cover Fossil as a remnant of a prehistoric Pok&eacute;mon that dwelled in the ocean, and describes the Plume Fossil as from a Pok&eacute;mon that lived in an ancient forest but could not fly (which is odd because the Plume Fossil's item description states that it came from a "Pok&eacute;mon that lived in the sky"). One of these fossils, of the player's choice, is also obtainable from Lenora in BW2 after beating the Elite Four, and rocks bought in Join Avenue may contain one of these fossils as well, but even with these added methods of acquiring them, the actual origins of the fossils remain unclear; they may not even originate from Unova. Both fossils can be revived at the museum at the front of the Nacrene City Gym.</p>


<div class="align-center">
	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/tirtouga.gif" alt="" />
	<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/carracosta.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<h3>- Tirtouga &amp; Carracosta -</h3>
<p><b>Tirtouga's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Prototurtle Pok&eacute;mon) About 100 million years ago, these Pok&eacute;mon swam in oceans. It is thought they also went on land to attack prey.</p>
<p><b>Tirtouga's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Prototurtle Pok&eacute;mon) Restored from a fossil, this Pok&eacute;mon can dive to depths beyond half a mile.</p>
<p>Tirtouga is the premier physical Shell Smash sweeper in Little Cup and has been since its introduction. The introduction of Berry Juice to XY Little Cup made Tirtouga even more dangerous than it previously was, because not only will Sturdy allow it to survive any one hit, but Berry Juice with 21 HP will also fully restore its health and cause Sturdy to activate a second time for it. This basically makes Tirtouga have to be hit at least three times in order to be defeated in most cases, no matter how powerful or effective the hits are, which allows for tremendously easy setup as well as sweeping. The Knock Off buff helped to neutralize this advantage to an extent, as being hit with this move and having its Berry Juice removed breaks Sturdy and will allow another hit to take it out. Though it usually runs a Shell Smash set with two STAB attacks and either Earthquake or Aqua Jet, Tirtouga can also run a more defensive support set with Stealth Rock, Scald, and Knock Off for assisting its team with entry hazards and removing items. Tirtouga also walls Fletchling and is a great Pok&eacute;mon in general, one that should always be taken into consideration when teambuilding in Little Cup.</p>

<p><b>Carracosta's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Prototurtle Pok&eacute;mon) They can live in the ocean and on land. A slap from one of them is enough to open a hole in the bottom of a tanker.</p>
<p><b>Carracosta's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Prototurtle Pok&eacute;mon) It could knock out a foe with a slap from one of its developed front appendages and chew it up, shell or bones and all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Carracosta's viability in Level 100 battling is the complete opposite of Tirtouga's viability in Little Cup. It is arguably the worst fully evolved Water-type Shell Smash sweeper ever created, mostly because of its horrendously low Speed stat, but can still work as a bulky supporter with an approach similar to pre-evolution's support set. It had a reasonable niche in BW NU, but now that Kabutops has dropped to NU in XY, it is hardly justifiable on a NU team anymore despite its advantage over it in Shell Smash as a boosting option. However, Carracosta's decent Special Attack makes it usable as a specially inclined Shell Smash user in XY NU, not just for its surprise factor but particularly for its ability to destroy one of its typical counters depending on which Hidden Power type it carries; Hidden Power Fire roasts Ferroseed and Hidden Power Grass lays waste to Seismitoad. It's interesting to note that Tirtouga and Carracosta are the only fossil-based Pok&eacute;mon in existence to have Rock as their secondary typing (all others have Rock as their primary), which doesn't change their effectiveness in any way but still remains an unexplainable inconsistency among the fossils.</p>

<h3>- Archen &amp; Archeops -</h3>
<p><b>Archen's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (First Bird Pok&eacute;mon) Revived from a fossil, this Pokémon it's thought to be the ancestor of all bird Pokémon.</p>
<p><b>Archen's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (First Bird Pok&eacute;mon) Said to be an ancestor of bird Pokémon, they were unable to fly and moved about by hopping from one branch to another.</p>
<p>Archen is a Pok&eacute;mon that gained popularity in XY Little Cup due to Berry Juice being made legal and Defog being improved to remove entry hazards from both sides of the playing field. It is extremely versatile, able to function as a decently fast and powerful attacker as well as a team supporter and U-turn pivot. It possesses the second highest Attack stat in Little Cup, right behind Cranidos, and strikes fear into a huge part of the metagame with its devastatingly strong Acrobatics attack after having lost or consumed its item. In the coverage department, it's also gifted with both Earthquake and Knock Off. What Archen can do defensively and for support is also incredible, having access to Roar, Stealth Rock, Defog, and Roost. Its typing might seem horrible at first, as Rock / Flying does compound a ton of weaknesses, but it actually allows Archen to single-handedly beat the troublesome core of Fletchling + Diglett, in which Diglett traps and kills Flying-resistant Pok&eacute;mon so that Fletchling can freely sweep. Archen's good Speed and Rock typing also let it check Normal-type heavy hitters Bunnelby and Zigzagoon. Its Defeatist ability might be off-putting as well, but having Berry Juice for offensive sets and Roost for defensive sets alleviates this drawback. Archen is a very good Pok&eacute;mon in XY Little Cup with tons of options.</p>

<p><b>Archeops's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (First Bird Pok&eacute;mon) They are intelligent and will cooperate to catch prey. From the ground, they use a running start to take flight.</p>
<p><b>Archeops's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (First Bird Pok&eacute;mon) It runs better than it flies. It takes off into the sky by running at a speed of 25 mph.</p>
<p>Archeops is a lot like Rampardos as a super-powerful attacker that usually comes at a high cost, but with a unique twist. Unlike Rampardos, Archeops actually has the Speed it needs to wreak havoc, and it also has a variety of utility and support moves to go with that, including Roost, Defog, Taunt, and U-turn. Its Flying typing and access to Acrobatics makes it threatening in different ways than Rampardos as well, especially when taking opposing Fighting-types into consideration. Archeops has the stats and moves to be an awesome sweeper on its own without requiring support for its team, but what really hurts it is its Defeatist ability, which cuts its offensive stats by half if its health goes below 50%. Roost can be used to pull it back to its original potency, but Archeops is so frail that any decently powerful neutral hit would knock it back down to Defeatist range, which often makes that a waste. As a result, its usage is low enough that it lurks the corridors of NU with the likes of many of its other fossil brethren. It has a fast and strong STAB Head Smash, which will devastate anything, but this also comes at the cost of either killing Archeops or putting it in Defeatist range with the recoil and therefore making its offensive stance a lot less usable. However, in the heat of battle, Archeops can use this move as a kamikaze to block Rapid Spin and Defog, which require a target to work, while dealing heavy damage in the process. It is only effective for a short time in most cases, and it will kill what you want it to kill, but its drawbacks are enough to give it such low usage.</p>

<h2>Fossils of Kalos</h2>
<p>Behold, the <b>Jaw Fossil</b> and <b>Sail Fossil</b> of the Kalos region. These fossils are found within Glittering Cave, and one or the other, chosen by the player, is acquirable after defeating Team Flare inside the cavern. The Pok&eacute;mon that these relics come from are the most obviously dinosaur-based creatures of all the fossil Pok&eacute;mon, with the exception of Aerodactyl. These fossils are also very special in that they come from Pok&eacute;mon with dual typings that have never been seen before at all in any generation thus far. Uniqueness comes at a cost in the case, however, as these Pok&eacute;mon also have more weaknesses than every other fossil-based Pok&eacute;mon. Both fossils can be resurrected at the laboratory in Ambrette Town.</p>

<h3>- Tyrunt &amp; Tyrantrum -</h3>
<p><b>Tyrunt's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Royal Heir Pok&eacute;mon) This Pokémon was restored from a fossil. If something happens that it doesn't like, it throws a tantrum and runs wild.</p>
<p><b>Tyrunt's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Royal Heir Pok&eacute;mon) Its immense jaws have enough destructive force that it can chew up an automobile. It lived 100 million years ago.</p>
<p>Dragon-types in Little Cup have almost had to go into hiding in XY because of the introduction of the Fairy type, but Tyrunt is at least the best Dragon-type in the tier. It has the highest Attack stat of all Little Cup Dragons, access to Dragon Dance, and also a very colorful movepool which includes a plethora of bite-based moves to use with Strong Jaw. Its Rock / Dragon typing is one that has never been seen before, and even though it is certainly unique, it comes with quite a few weaknesses as a package deal. Tyrunt can work well as a sweeper if Fairy- and Fighting-types are eliminated or weakened in advance, and it can also function decently well as a bulky team shuffler with Stealth Rock and Dragon Tail. It can do a lot and can catch an opponent off guard, but it's unfortunately a mediocre Pok&eacute;mon at best, let down mainly because of the weaknesses that come with its typing.</p>

<p><b>Tyrantrum's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Despot Pok&eacute;mon) Thanks to its gargantuan jaws, which could shred thick metal plates as if they were paper, it was invincible in the ancient world it once inhabited.</p>
<p><b>Tyrantrum's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Despot Pok&eacute;mon) Nothing could stop this Pok&eacute;mon 100 million years ago, so it behaved like a king.</p>
<p>The tyrant king is an interesting new fossil Pok&eacute;mon this generation that boasts the original Rock / Dragon typing, as well as the new ability Strong Jaw, which boosts all bite-based attacks (except Bug Bite), of which it gets them all. Its expansive physical movepool, combined with its high Attack and decent bulk, makes it a formidable user of Dragon Dance, which also remedies its Speed issue. What makes Tyrantrum stand out in XY RU is the fact that it takes total advantage of common Pok&eacute;mon like Moltres and Slowking and also has the power to OHKO Escavalier and even Eviolite Gligar after a Dragon Dance, which is insane. However, Tyrantrum has problems breaking through other defensive Pok&eacute;mon in the tier even if it has the appropriate coverage move to hit them. Doublade, Rhyperior, and Cobalion can all stomach a super effective Earthquake from it and hit back extremely hard with their super effective STAB attacks. In addition, bulky supporters like Alomomola and Aromatisse can usually switch into Tyrantrum and either wear it down or force it out without problems (though Lum Berry Tyrantrum may be able to break through Alomomola with continued setup), and the same is true for Gastrodon, especially if it has Earth Power. It's also one of those Pok&eacute;mon that would be so much better if they could have more than four moves on one set, because it can do so many things but not all at once. That said, it's considered generally mediocre in RU, but Tyrantrum does have some niche uses that can propel it to victory if used properly. What's really going to shake things up is when its hidden ability Rock Head gets released; having a Dragon Dance sweeper with STAB Head Smash and no recoil is a thought that is beyond terrifying.</p>

<h3>- Amaura &amp; Aurorus -</h3>
<p><b>Amaura's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Tundra Pok&eacute;mon) This ancient Pok&eacute;mon was restored from part of its body that had been frozen in ice for over 100 million years.</p>
<p><b>Amaura's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Tundra Pok&eacute;mon) This calm Pok&eacute;mon lived in a cold land where there were no violent predators like Tyrantrum.</p>
<p>Amaura is the Kalos fossil counterpart to Tyrunt and, fittingly so, it has also been endowed with a never-before-seen typing in Rock / Ice. It comes with a good movepool, including powerful attacks and support moves, but unfortunately, its typing really hampers its ability to put up with damage at all, as Amaura has so many weaknesses that it's actually rare for a Pok&eacute;mon it's facing to not have a super effective move against it, not to mention its weakness to Stealth Rock. It's also 4x weak to both Fighting and Steel, which is makes it easy to bring down with priority. Ironically, XY LC was a better environment for Amaura when Yanma, Tangela, and Gligar were still in the metagame, because it could hold a Choice Scarf and OHKO them all with Refrigerate-boosted Nature Power (Tri Attack), giving it a valid reason to find use. The only thing Amaura has going for it in the current LC metagame is its Flying resistance, but there are tons of more durable things that have that advantage. Steel-types give it huge problems as well, as they resist both of Amaura's STABs and also OHKO back easily. Earth Power will come to it as a tutor move in ORAS, which may help it out in that regard, but it's safe to assume that Amaura will remain a poor Pok&eacute;mon that requires too much support and extreme care to use effectively; it can be expected to go down if just about anything other than a bird gets the chance to hit it.</p>

<p><b>Aurorus's Pok&eacute;mon X Dex Entry:</b> (Tundra Pok&eacute;mon) The diamond-shaped crystals on its body expel air as cold as -240 degrees Fahrenheit, surrounding its enemies and encasing them in ice.</p>
<p><b>Aurorus's Pok&eacute;mon Y Dex Entry:</b> (Tundra Pok&eacute;mon) Using its diamond-shaped crystals, it can instantly create a wall of ice to block an opponent's attack.</p>
<p>Aurorus obviously has the same defensive issues in Level 100 battling, but it at least has always had access to Earthquake to keep it from being powerless against incoming Steel-types. The myriad of weaknesses that come with its unique typing are almost solely responsible for Aurorus's lack of usage in the competitive scene, which is a huge letdown for it, but it still finds use in XY NU, at least. One very important advantage of Aurorus over Amaura is its bulk; it can actually afford to take a 2x super effective hit in most cases and still get to move. Freeze-Dry is another notable thing it has access to, which gets a nasty 4x super effective hit against NU Pok&eacute;mon such as Ludicolo and Seismitoad, foes that would usually only take neutral damage from an Ice-type move. It can viably run Choice Specs to deal considerable damage to the opposition with its high Base Power moves, though this limits its attacking to one move. Flying-types in NU such as Swellow and Dodrio can't touch Aurorus, and apart from that, it also works as a solid check against Xatu, Cryogonal, Tangela, Gourgeist, and bulky Seismitoad. Aurorus is a decent attacker in the lower tiers, but it must be played carefully for it to work well.</p>


<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Many fossils exist in Pok&eacute;mon, and potentially many more have yet to be introduced. Stay tuned for the next installment of Pok&eacute;mon History, which will cover legendary trios over the generations!</p>
