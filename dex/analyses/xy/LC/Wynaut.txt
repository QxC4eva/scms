Overview
########
- One of the most annoying Pokemon to fight against
- Access to Shadow Tag, one of the best abilities in the game, good synergy with CounterCoat
- Nice check to some Pokemon like Meditite, Snover, and pretty much anything that doesn't super-effectively hit it.
- With Safeguard, it can also trap an counter slow walls such as Foongus, Lileep and Slowpoke.
- Sadly, so much of the meta can break through it, due to the abundance of Knock Off, 
- Still a nice safety blanket against some Pokemon, and Encore is just so helpful to have with Shadow Tag.

Why Not? 
########
name: Why Not?
move 1: Encore
move 2: Counter
move 3: Mirror Coat
move 4: Safeguard / Tickle / Destiny Bond
ability: Shadow Tag
item: Berry Juice
EVs: 236 HP / 132 Def / 132 SpD
Nature: Bold

Moves
===============
- Encore to lock people into non-attacking moves like Stealth Rock or Defog, for free setup.
- Counter to counter physical attacks, as a part of the CounterCoat combination.
- Mirror Coat is for special attacks, completing the CounterCoat. 
- Safeguard aids set up Pokemon if a status inducing move is Encored. It also allows it to avoid Toxic and Sleep which would greatly hinder Wynaut.
- Tickle can be used in conjuction with Pursuit or Diglet to trap and KO something with ease.
- Destiny Bond is a cool last ditch effort.

Set Details
==============
- EV spread gives maximum HP, totaling 49 with Berry Juice. This means Wynaut is technically capable of dishing out 96 damage before fainting. 
- Bold is chosen to absorb Fighting-types attacks more effectively, however the Defense and Special Defense EVs can be customize to deal with specific Pokemon. 
- Added speed can be used to safely outpace Ferroseed and Encore it. It has the ability to speed creep on many walls, depending on what you want to remove. 92 EVs gives it 10 Speed, allowing it to outspeed most slow walls.


Usage Tips
=============
- Encore non-attacking moves like Stealth Rock, then switch out for free momentum.
- Use it to remove specific counters like Timburr or Meditite. 


Team Options
=============
- It's really good when you have a frail setup team, a good failsafe on some Offensive teams.
- Good when you need a reliable Meditite check.
- Reliably gets rid of Choice Scarf users. 
- Set up sweepers are very effective at using the turns provided by Encore. 
- Diglet or Pursuit is very useful with Tickle, meaning the opponent is stuck using something like Stealth Rock and is going to have -6 Def.
- Voltturn users are fantastic partners as they can often give Wynaut a free switch in.

Other Options
===========
- Splash.
- Literally none.
- Eviolite maybe?

Checks and Counters
===========
- There are no true counters to Wynaut, since outside of Volt Switch, U-Turn, Baton Pass and Parting Shot nothing can switch into it.
- Using Wynaut is really risky against setup sweepers that can potentially outmindgame you, like Pawniard, Misdreavus, and Dwebble.
- Anything with Taunt kills it.
- Ghost-types are immune to the effects of Shadow Tag this generation.
- Spritzee isn't affected by encore, so can use Wynaut as set-up bait.
