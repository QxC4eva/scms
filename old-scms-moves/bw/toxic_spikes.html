<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lays down poison-inducing spikes on the foe's field. If this move is used twice, the Toxic Spikes will badly poison the foe. Fails after two layers are present on the target's side of the field. Only affects grounded Pokemon.</p>

<p>Grounded Pokemon are Pokemon that are not part Flying-type, do not have the ability Levitate, do not have Ingrain active, do not have Magnet Rise active, and are not holding an Air Balloon. If Gravity is active, all Pokemon are grounded. All Pokemon holding an Iron Ball are grounded.</p>

<p>If a Pokemon is Baton Passed a Substitute, it is still poisoned by Toxic Spikes. If Safeguard is in effect when a Pokemon switches in, it is not poisoned by Toxic Spikes. All layers are removed from foe's side of the field when they use Rapid Spin, or when the user's team uses Defog. If a player switches in a grounded Poison-type Pokemon while Toxic Spikes are on that player's side of the field, the Toxic Spikes are removed, even if Safeguard is in effect or the Pokemon is Baton Passed a Substitute. In a double or triple battle, this move will affect all opposing Pokemon. Toxic Spikes do not activate the ability Synchronize. Pokemon with the ability Magic Guard can be poisoned by Toxic Spikes, but do not take damage from the poison. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Softening up your opponent with residual damage is always a great idea. Of the three types of entry hazards, Toxic Spikes—which can be laid by Tentacruel, Forretress, and Roserade— presents the biggest threat to defensively oriented teams, as Toxic poison wears down their Pokemon in no time. If you need a bit of extra damage against grounded threats, consider adding Toxic Spikes to further pressure your opponent. Just be warned that most dedicated stall teams will pack a grounded Poison-type or spinner to remove the Toxic Spikes.</p>
