Moves
========

- Sticky Web sets down a hazard that causes a Speed drop to every grounded enemy that enters battle and can be useful in the long run for securing important Speed advantages
- Megahorn is now available to Spinarak and is its most powerful attack, dealing surprising amounts of damage against neutral targets and slamming the ones that are weak to Bug
- Protect blocks Fake Out and therefore guarantees that Focus Sash stays intact long enough to get Sticky Web down without fail
- Toxic Spikes is an additional hazard that inflicts all grounded enemies with Poison status upon entering battle, Poison-type foes effortlessly remove these by coming in, however
- Poison Jab is a secondary STAB option available to Spinarak and is decently powerful
- Baton Pass can be used to "Dry-Pass" to a teammate after getting Sticky Web down and can be useful in maintaining momentum, Spinarak can be sacrificed later as death fodder, usually

Set Details
========

- Adamant nature gives Spinarak a respectable maxed Attack stat of 16, from which it can fire off STAB Megahorns for shocking amounts of damage
- Jolly can be used for a bit more Speed at the cost of a bit of attacking power, but it still only maxes at a mere stat of 13
- An advantage Spinarak has over other Sticky Web setters in the tier is that Insomnia makes it immune to Sleep status, and therefore it cannot be prevented from setting up Sticky Web by way of being put to sleep

Usage Tips
========

- Always use Protect when facing a Fake Out user and in the lead position
- Getting Sticky Web down is the absolute highest priority, everything else can wait and if you get nothing done except get this one hazard down, Spinarak has succeeded in doing its job
- Recognize users of Taunt or multi-hit moves, particularly Rock Blast, and don't allow users of these moves to stop Spinarak from doing its job, switch out if necessary, also be wary of Natu
- Don't use Toxic Spikes if your opponent has any grounded Poison-types on their team that can still battle
- Baton Pass can be great for securing momentum even without boosts to pass
- It can often doesn't matter if you sacrifice Spinarak once its set up Sticky Web. 
- However it could be preserved as it is a decent switch-in to most Fighting-types thanks to its typing.

Team Options
========

- Dark-types that can deal with Misdreavus for Spinarak are greatly appreciated, examples include Vullaby, Pawniard, Carvanha, etc
- Fighting-types like Mienfoo come to mind for taking the Rock Blasts aimed at Spinarak in an attempt to override its Focus Sash
- Croagunk beats the Prankster Taunt users Cottonee and Purrloin fairly handily, Murkrow has access to this combination as well but does not commonly run Taunt; Magnemite or Chinchou can be ideal teammates for Murkrow if it is deemed a problem
- Strong attackers that are sort of lacking in the Speed department that would appreciate a Speed advantage over their opponents include Mienfoo, Timburr, Cacnea, Pawniard, etc
- Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Frillish work well for blocking Rapid Spin, and having Defiant Pawniard as a teammate punishes the opposition for using Defog to clear Sticky Web on the switch-in

Other Options
########

- Sucker Punch can be used to surprise Misdreavus or other Dark-weak targets
- Shadow Sneak can also be used to pick off weakened threats; its very weak but is more reliable than Sucker Punch.
- X-Scissor is an option over Megahorn that is notably less powerful but is ideal if Megahorn's accuracy is unappealing and you don't want to risk it; however, Spinarak's offense is not what it's supposed to use for anyway
- Agility can be used in tandem with Baton Pass to give it some use after Sticky Web is set.
- Eviolite is useful if you prefer to have some bulk which allows it to easily switch in on Fighting-types not named ScragScraggy or Meditite.

Checks & Counters
########

**Pawniard**: Defiant Pawniard is by far a Sticky Web strategy's greatest enemy; it gives it a free +2 Attack and makes it horrifying to face, beware of this thing if you're using Spinarak

**Natu**: Natu is hit decently hard by Megahorn but the problem lies in that Natu's Magic Bounce actually deflects Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes back to Spinarak's side of the field

**Taunt users**: Users of Taunt, most notably ones with the Prankster ability, can prevent Spinarak from putting Sticky Web down and therefore defeat its entire purpose

**Multi-hit move users**: Multi-hit attacks override Focus Sash if the combined damage results in a KO from full health, and Rock Blast is particularly problematic due to Spinarak's Rock weakness; notable users of multi-hit moves include Dwebble, Shellder, Minccino, etc
