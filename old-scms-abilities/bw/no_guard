All attacks used by and used on the wielder will never miss. 

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All attacks used by the wielder or that target the wielder will never miss. The accuracy check is skipped entirely,  meaning evasion and accuracy modifiers are ignored. Moves affected by No Guard will also hit Pokemon in the semi-invulnerable turn of <a href="/bw/moves/bounce">Bounce</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/dig">Dig</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/dive">Dive</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/fly">Fly</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/shadow_force">Shadow Force</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/sky_drop">Sky Drop</a>. 

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>No Guard is best known for being used with <a href="/bw/pokemon/machamp">Machamp</a> for the sake of using <a href="/bw/moves/dynamicpunch">DynamicPunch</a> over and over again for guaranteed confusionâ€”not to mention being smacked by a 100 Base Power STAB Fighting-type move off 130 base Attack. Although Machamp is still horribly annoying, it is outclassed somewhat overall by <a href="/bw/pokemon/conkeldurr">Conkeldurr</a>, so you will not see No Guard as much in the standard metagame, though it is quite the force to be reckoned with in UU. Further down the tier listings, <a href="/bw/pokemon/golurk">Golurk</a> also has access to the ability, but like Machamp, its applications are generally limited to DynamicPunch and <a href="/bw/moves/stone_edge">Stone Edge</a>, and as such <a href="/bw/abilities/iron_fist">Iron Fist</a> is typically preferred. No Guard's potential as an ability has yet to be fully tapped into, and it is seriously frightening if you think about the future possibilities, but as of right now it is only really seen on Machamp.</p>
