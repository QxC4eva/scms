move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Rain dance /Hidden Power Electric

item: Life Orb
evs: 36 Def / 200 SpA / 240 spe
ivs: 1 atk/30 SpA
nature: Modest

Moves
========
- Hydro Pump hits hard, especially under rain, though Surf can be used if you're concerned about a Hydro Pump miss.
- Sludge Bomb hits grass-types such as Snover and fairy types such as Spritzee, a common wall, very hard along with a 30% to poison.
- Earth Power severely hurts or KOs most Pawniards and chinchous it also dents croagunks and
- Hidden Power Electric hits bulky waters for some damage; who of which would normally wall Tympole. The Ivs are set for this so that it minimizes foul play damage and maintains hidden power electric
- Rain Dance can be used to support the team or sweep on your own.


Set Details
========
- EV spread maximizes Special Attack while still getting 16 speed outside of rain; the remainder is put into defense.
- An alternate spread of 36 Def / 196 SpA / 36 SpD / 236 Spe should be used if not using Hidden Power.
- Life Orb maximizes power, and the IVs minimize recoil.
- Swift Swim gives Tympole incredible speed in the rain.


Usage Tips
========
- Set up Rain
- Bring Tympole in, preferable near the middle or end of the game, when checks and counters have been weakened.
- Spam hydro pump
- Sweep.

Team Options
========
- Voltorb can serve as a suicide rain setter, letting Tympole come in and sweep for 7 turns.
- Fighting types such as Mienfoo timburr and Croagunk can pick off Munchlax, Ferroseed and lileep also they can cripple walls like slowpoke via knock off
- Bronzor can set up rain and stealth rocks, which is always a big help.
- Murkrow and riolu have priority rain dance which can be useful in jams.
- Other swift swim sweepers such as kabuto, omanyte, and anorith can form an offensive core. Kabuto and omanyte specifically can lure in lileep and hit it with an ice beam.
- Tympole lures chinchous in allowing tympole to hit them with earth power clearing up a sweep for mantyke.

Other Options
########

- Sub + 3 Attacks, can be used to get around sucker punchers, but Tympole many doesn't have many
- Toxic can be used for support but tympole's frailty hinders it
- Sludge Wave over Sludge Bomb for a tiny bit more power.
- Hidden Power Fighting for Munchlax ferroseed and lileep
- Hidden power grass to hit other swift swim sweepers such as kabuto omanyte and tirtouga for an ohko
- Items such as berry juice and eviolite increase tympole's longevity and bulk respectively however the power from life orb is lost
- Damp rock can be used to extend the time of rain but the power lost without life orb is very obvious
- Surf and scald have better accuracy then hydro pump but you miss out on many important kos.

Checks & Counters
########
Grass types that are neutral to sludge bomb such as foongus and lileep the latter getting a boost from hydro pump. Ferroseed boasts an immunity to sludge bomb and can retaliate with a seed bomb. Although 4x weak to sludge bomb cottonee has priority thunder wave which stops tympoles sweeps cold.

Munchlax makes a terrific counter to tympole sponging tympoles moves well even a rain boosted hydro pump.

Bulky waters such as slowpoke and staryu wall tympole for days. Chinchou and mantyke are checks as chinchou can't switch into an earth power, mantyke stops tympole cold if lacking hidden power electric.

Porygon is bulky enough to take a hit from tympole then counter with a tri attack.

Snover messes with tympole because it removes the nearly mandatory rain that makes tympole successful.

Although uncommon cloud nine users such as psyduck and lickitung negate tympoles swift swim and the boost to his hydro pump.

Tympole really hates paralysis so pokemon like the previously stated slowpoke and chinchou can thunder wave tympole making it useless without a cleric.

Priority users such as mienfoo and Croagunk cripple tympole, Croagunk is also immune to hydro pump however is not safe from an earth power.
