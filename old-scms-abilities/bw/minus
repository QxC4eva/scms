[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Minus grants a 50% Special Attack boost in double or triple battles if on the field with a partner using <a href="/bw/abilities/plus">Plus</a> or Minus. This boost will not stack if there are multiple Pokemon with Plus or Minus on the field.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Really, no Pokemon that are usable have Minus; even fewer than Plus. You will never see Minus used competitively.</p>
