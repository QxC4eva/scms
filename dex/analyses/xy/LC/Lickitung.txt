Overview
########
- The tongue
- Bulky all around, great Wish supporter
- Only one weakness (Fighting-type)
- Is immune to confusion status

Wish Support
########
name: Wish Support
move 1: Wish
move 2: Protect
move 3: Knock Off / Heal Bell / Body Slam / Toxic
move 4: Knock Off / Heal Bell / Body Slam / Toxic
ability: Oblivious
item: Eviolite 
evs: 196 HP / 236 Def / 76 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

- Wish is used to continuously heal while stalling with Toxic, and can also be used to heal teammates and provide safer switch-ins for them as well
- Protect helps to stall with Toxic and also to guarantee Wish recovery
- Toxic wears down the foe over time
- The final two moves can be any combination of the 4 listed.
- Knock Off is great for removing items and allows it to be a good counter to Ghost-types
- Heal Bell heals your teams status which adds to Lickitung's amazing support role
- Body Slam is a nice STAB attack which can be useful for paralysis
- Toxic can be used to help stall out walls, particularly with Wish and Protect.
-Maybe Dragon Tail/EQ/Return/Fire Blast deserve mentions/slashes.

Set Details
========

- Eviolite is the optimal item for providing more bulk, since Wish is already a continuous and reliable source of recovery and greatly outclasses the one-time use of Berry Juice
- Max HP to maximise the Wishes you pass
- 236 Def EVs maximize ability to wall physical attacks
- Remainder in SpD for improved overall bulk

Usage Tips
========

- Lickitung can switch into most unboosted non-Fighting-type attacks with ease and does not have the Poison- and Steel-type weaknesses that Spritzee has, giving it that over Spritzee
- It's best to keep Lickitung away from Fighting-types at all times, and also keep it from being hit with Knock Off, as its tanking capabilities are significantly reduced without Eviolite
- Be careful not to poison foes that have the Guts ability, particularly Timburr

Team Options
========

- Spritzee can work with Lickitung to form an effective Wish-passing core and can also deal with Lickitung's weakness to Fighting-type attacks; alternatively, Lickitung's Earthquake hits the Poison- and Steel-types that threaten Spritzee for super effective damage
- Snubbull, Koffing and Cottonee appreciate having Lickitung as a partner in particular for Wish support, and can take on the Fighting-types that beat Lickitung.
- Trubbish also makes a good teammate for Lickitung, dealing with the Fighting-types which carry Knock Off, with its combination of Sticky Hold, Berry Juice, and Recycle
- Dark-types like Pawniard, Stunky, and Vullaby can help Lickitung beat Ghost-types if it isn't running Knock Off, which are immune to Return and Earthquake (as well as Toxic in Gastly's case)

Other Options
########

- Huge physical movepool, elemental punches, Power Whip, Aqua Tail, Earthquake
- Huge special movepool, sadly nothing Lickitung can really use, except Fire Blast which can hit Steel-types that are immune to Toxic, particularly Ferroseed
- Curse, Swords Dance to setup while healing with Wish
- Iron Head for Fairy-types
- Zen Headbutt for Fighting-types
- RestTalk
- Curse can be used with RestTalk and Dragon Tail but the introduction of Fairies makes this less viable. 
- Substitute + Focus Punch
- Dragon Tail
- Cloud Nine can help to beat Sunny Day teams, but Lickitung cannot use Wish or Heal Bell with it.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Scraggy, Mienfoo, Timburr, etc.

**Ghost-types**: Gastly, Frillish, etc. (if not running Knock Off)

**Burn status**: Fire-types, Will-O-Wisp, Scald users

**Poison-immune Levitators**: Koffing, Gastly, and Bronzor in particular can avoid both Toxic and Earthquake, making it hard for Lickitung to damage them

**Archen**: It's a solid check as it resists Return and is immune to Earthquake
