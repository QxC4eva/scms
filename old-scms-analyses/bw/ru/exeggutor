[Overview]

<p>Exeggutor, a Pokemon that has been around since the days of RBY, has fallen into near obscurity with the advent of Pokemon Black and White. Even in RU, it faces stiff competition from other offensive Grass-types, such as Sceptile, Lilligant, and even Tangrowth. Thankfully, Exeggutor has a few advantages that set it apart from its fellow Grass-types, most notably a spectacular base Special Attack, which is significantly higher than that of any other Grass-type in the tier; it also possesses a moderately useful secondary Psychic typing and two very nifty abilities in Harvest and Chlorophyll. Admittedly, the eggplant has a few major issues that the other Grass-types in the tier lack, including a Pursuit weakness, less durability than Tangrowth, and less Speed than both Lilligant or Sceptile. However, its tremendous Special Attack and useful abilities allow it to solidly fill a few niches in the RU tier.</p>

[SET]
name: Sunny Day
move 1: Sunny Day
move 2: SolarBeam / Giga Drain
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Psyshock
move 4: Sleep Powder
item: Life Orb / Heat Rock
ability: Chlorophyll
nature: Modest / Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a great Special Attack stat and the Chlorophyll ability, Exeggutor is an excellent choice for a sun sweeper. After setting up Sunny Day his Speed will double, turning him into a potent threat. SolarBeam is his STAB attack of choice, as it no longer requires a turn to charge under sun. Giga Drain can be used over SolarBeam, as it works outside of sun and offsets Life Orb's recoil. Hidden Power Fire nails the Steel-, Grass-, and Bug-types that resist SolarBeam, and gets a power boost from the sun. Psyshock can be used in place of it, however, for added STAB and good overall coverage. Sleep Powder is the final move of choice, as it cripples one of Exeggutor's would-be counters.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs maximize Special Attack and Speed, giving Exeggutor the greatest opportunity to sweep; the remaining 4 are placed into HP for added bulk. The choice between Modest and Timid comes down to your needs: Modest ups Exeggutor's damage output, but Timid gives him the ability to outrun Choice Scarf Typhlosion and Accelgor under sun, both of which otherwise outspeed and OHKO. Life Orb is the preferred item for greater damage, but Heat Rock offers 3 added turns of sun for sweeping. Grass Knot is also an option for hitting heavier foes, such as Rhydon, for more damage than Giga Drain. Psychic is a possible coverage move, but Psyshock is usually better for breaking through specially defensive opponents. Finally, Synthesis can be used over Sleep Powder for recovery, but the ability to shut down a counter is sorely missed.</p>

<p>This set is best used on a full sun team, as it can both provide support for and take advantage of support from other team members. Tangrowth, Sawsbuck, and Lilligant are all capable Chlorophyll users that appreciate the sun that Exeggutor provides. Powerful Fire-type sweepers, such as Entei, Charizard, and Typhlosion, work fantastically under sun, as they receive an additional boost to their STAB Fire-type attacks; Charizard in particular loves sun, as Solar Power provides it with a massive power boost to its Special Attack. Fire-type sweepers also help break through Steel-types that wall both of Exeggutor's STAB moves. Finally, bulky Sunny Day users can lighten the burden for Exeggutor and allow him to sweep without setting up. Uxie and Sandslash are two prime candidates for this role; both can provide Stealth Rock to further aid Exeggutor's sweep, and Sandslash offers the Rapid Spin support that sun teams often desperately need.</p>

[SET]
name: Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Leaf Storm / Giga Drain
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Sleep Powder
item: Life Orb
ability: Harvest
nature: Quiet
evs: 232 HP / 24 Def / 252 SpA
ivs: 0 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Exeggutor's pitiful Speed becomes his greatest asset under Trick Room; after setting it up, he "outspeeds" almost anything. Leaf Storm is his STAB attack of choice, decimating anything that doesn't resist it. Giga Drain, however, offers more consistent power and added recovery. Psychic offers great secondary STAB, and the only type that resists both is Steel. Sleep Powder is an excellent choice for the final slot, as it allows Exeggutor to cripple one of his counters or any other Pokemon that threatens Trick Room teams in general.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs and EVs make Exeggutor as "fast" as possible under Trick Room. The given EVs also maximize his Special Attack and bulk, providing him with extra cushioning to set up and the power needed to sweep. Life Orb is the item of choice for giving extra power and the ability to switch moves. Harvest is the best ability for Trick Room, as if the opponent runs sun, Chlorophyll will cause Exeggutor to lose his pseudo-Speed advantage. Grass Knot can be used over the other Grass-type attacks to hit heavier foes harder, but Leaf Storm and Giga Drain have greater overall utility. Psyshock is an option over Psychic for hitting special walls harder, but the added power of Psychic is preferred. Exeggutor can utilize 2 Speed EVs to take advantage of various Hidden Power types for added coverage. Hidden Power Fire, Fighting, or Ground gives him the ability to take on Steel-types, though Hidden Power Fire offers the best overall coverage. Hidden Power Ice is also useful for hitting Sigilyph, Murkrow, and other Flying-, Grass-, or Dragon-types. Exeggutor can drop Sleep Powder for a third attack, but he loses the ability to eliminate one counter by doing so.</p>

<p>As this set is best used on full Trick Room teams, other users and abusers of Trick Room are welcomed teammates. Klinklang resists all of Exeggutor's weaknesses except Fire, and Exeggutor can handle Fighting- and Ground-type attacks for it in return. Slowking can handle those Fire-type attacks, and lures in Electric- and Grass-type moves for Exeggutor to set up on. Audino is immune to Exeggutor's Ghost-type weakness, can offer Wish or Healing Wish support, and appreciates having a Fighting-type resistor for a partner. Aggron is a great sweeper that offers good type synergy with Exeggutor, as Exeggutor covers all of its weaknesses, and Aggron returns the favor, except for Fire-type attacks. Hariyama is also a useful ally, as it can remove the Dark- and Ghost-types that threaten many Trick Room users, including Exeggutor.</p>

[SET]
name: Lum Berry + Harvest
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Powder
move 3: Leaf Storm / Giga Drain
move 4: Psyshock / Psychic
item: Lum Berry
ability: Harvest
nature: Modest
evs: 156 HP / 252 SpA / 100 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to the combination of Lum Berry and Harvest, Exeggutor can switch into common status moves from Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Slowking, and either cripple the foe with Sleep Powder or retaliate with one of its STAB moves. In the first slot, Rest is used to heal Exeggutor from residual damage taken from entry hazards and resisted moves, and is risk-free thanks to Lum Berry. When Exeggutor should use Rest depends on the foe's team. For example, if Exeggutor is at half health and the foe has a Slowking out, Exeggutor should use Rest immediately so it doesn't get KOed by Fire Blast the next time it switches into it. In the second slot, Sleep Powder is used to incapacitate common switch-ins such as Moltres and Druddigon. Leaf Storm occupies the third slot, and thanks to its immediate power, OHKOes several Pokemon that Giga Drain could not, including Slowking and Lanturn. It should be noted that Exeggutor has the strongest Leaf Storm in RU, which is a boon over other Grass-types like Sceptile. However, Giga Drain can be use for its reliability, but be warned, as missing out on the aforementioned KOs could be crucial. The last slot is dedicated to a Psychic STAB of choice. Psyshock is generally the better option, as it 2HKOes Lilligant after a Quiver Dance boost and OHKOes Roselia and Cryogonal after Stealth Rock. However, Psychic can be used to guarantee an OHKO on Emboar, as well as land a solid 2HKO on Tangrowth. It should be noted that Exeggutor's Psychic STAB is a huge advantage it has over other Grass-types, as it not only pressures common sleep inducers such as Emboar and Druddigon, but also destroys Amoonguss and Roselia, which would normally be threatening to other Grass-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs allow Exeggutor to outpace minimum Speed Lanturn while also making Exeggutor as powerful and bulky as possible. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-types like Escavalier, but it is very difficult to fit into Exeggutor's moveset. Pokemon that resist Exeggutor's weaknesses are good partners. Steelix resists five of Exeggutor's weaknesses and walls Escavalier. In return, Exeggutor can deal with Poliwrath and Qwilfish, which would otherwise give Steelix problems. Entei and Kabutops are also good partners, as they not only destroy Escavalier and Moltres, but also form a dangerous Fire / Water / Grass core. Qwilfish is another solid partner as it can switch into Durant and Entei and either cripple them with Thunder Wave or use them as a setup fodder for Spikes. In return, Exeggutor deals with Rotom-C and Sceptile fairly well. It also deals with non-Hidden Power Lilligant, assuming that Exeggutor has Psyshock and Lilligant doesn't use Sleep Powder the turn Exeggutor switches in. It should be noted that all of the aforementioned Pokemon appreciate Exeggutor's ability to absorb Scald, as many of them fare poorly against bulky Water-types and are greatly hindered when burned.</p>

[SET]
name: SubSeed
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Protect
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Psychic
item: Sitrus Berry
ability: Harvest
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Exeggutor is an extremely capable SubSeed user, thanks to his ability, Harvest. With Harvest, he can regenerate Sitrus Berries, which heal off the damage from Substitute whenever Exeggutor drops below half of his health. Substitute protects him from status and attacks, while Leech Seed provides constant recovery while chipping away at the foe. Protect further stalls out the foe, giving Exeggutor an added to turn to leech off of its opponent. Hidden Power Fire is the attack of choice, as it hits Grass-types super effectively, and they are the only type immune to Leech Seed. Psychic offers higher Base Power and STAB, but it is walled by Dark-types, which can hit Exeggutor for massive damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With a Bold nature and the given EVs, Exeggutor becomes as physically bulky as possible. Harvest is his ability of choice, as it allows him to constantly reuse his Sitrus Berry and differentiates him from other SubSeed users. Exeggutor has access to Wish and Ingrain, both of which offer extra recovery, but they leave him vulnerable to Grass-types. Sleep Powder is an option over Protect, as it can eliminate one of Exeggutor's counters, but Protect's stalling ability is more beneficial.</p>

<p>Toxic and Toxic Spikes support are highly recommended to take advantage of Exeggutor's stalling capabilities. Scolipede and Qwilfish both offer Toxic Spikes support, and Qwilfish in particular boasts excellent type synergy with Exeggutor. As this set forces the opponent to switch or have their Pokemon slowly drained from Leech Seed, all entry hazards are welcomed support for added damage. Omastar and Ferroseed work quite well for Spikes support, while Steelix and Sandslash are great choices for Stealth Rock. Whenever one abuses hazards this heavily, spinblockers become ideal teammates as well; Rotom and Spiritomb are solid Ghost-types that reliably handle this task.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Leaf Storm
move 2: Psychic / Psyshock
move 3: Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Sleep Powder
item: Choice Specs
ability: Chlorophyll
nature: Modest / Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 Spa / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While the other sets offer team support and the ability to sweep, Exeggutor becomes a great wall breaker when equipped with Choice Specs. Leaf Storm is his weapon of choice, punching holes in anything that doesn't resist it. Psychic and Psyshock are both excellent secondary STAB attacks; the former offers greater Base Power, while the latter stops specially defensive Pokemon that attempt to wall this set. Hidden Power Fire is Exeggutor's best option for hitting Steel-types and gains a boost when used in sun. Sleep Powder may seem like an odd move to be locked into, but its ability to cripple the opponent's main switch-in to Exeggutor is highly valuable.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs maximize Special Attack and Speed, and the remaining EVs boost Exeggutor's bulk. Chlorophyll takes advantage of the sun, regardless if it's yours or your opponent's. Hidden Power Ice is an alternative option, as it hits Sigilyph and Murkrow, which both wall Exeggutor's STAB moves. Giga Drain and Grass Knot are options to use over Leaf Storm; the former offers recovery, while the latter hits heavy foes for greater damage. The sheer power of Leaf Storm, however, is hard to pass up on. Synthesis is an option in the last moveslot, as it allows to Exeggutor to heal himself, so he can repeatedly come in and attack later.</p>

<p>As Exeggutor will usually be locked into Leaf Storm, Bouffalant and Sawsbuck are problematic due to Sap Sipper. Having a powerful Fighting-type to check them, such as Hitmonlee or Primeape, is highly recommended. Because this set has a high propensity for switching and Exeggutor is susceptible to all forms of entry hazards, carrying a Rapid Spin user is a wise choice. Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, and Sandslash are capable of this role. Sun support, while not necessary, is greatly welcomed for boosting Hidden Power Fire's power and activating Chlorophyll. Uxie and Moltres can both readily supply the weather, as can many other Pokemon in the tier.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Exeggutor can utilize a ChestoRest set with Harvest, using Rest to stay healthy and a constantly regenerating Chesto Berry to wake up. However, this is outclassed by the SubSeed set. Energy Ball offers a slight power increase over Giga Drain, but lacks the benefit of recovering health. Curse or Swords Dance can boost Exeggutor's decent base 95 Attack, but they are generally inferior given his lack of Speed or initial offensive presence. Synthesis can be used on any set for added recovery. Exeggutor is one of the few Gravity users, which can boost his accuracy but offers little direct support otherwise. Starf Berry can be used alongside Harvest to slowly boost Exeggutor's stats, but any set that can stall long enough to abuse it takes away vital coverage attacks and his ability to sweep once set up. Finally, Explosion is an option that can get a sun or Trick Room sweeper in for free after Exeggutor has set up the desired field effect.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bouffalant gets an Attack boost from any of Exeggutor's Grass-type attacks, Sleep Powder, and Leech Seed, while Exeggutor can only 2HKO it with Choice Specs-boosted Psychic. Sawsbuck can't switch in on Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ice, but it receives an Attack boost from any Grass-type attack as well. Altaria easily walls any of Exeggutor's attacks except Psyshock and Hidden Power Ice. Most fast sweepers can quickly revenge kill the Choice Specs set. Specially defensive Murkrow can Taunt Exeggutor's Sleep Powder and tank even Choice Specs Leaf Storm, while boasting a useful immunity to Psyshock; Mandibuzz performs similarly, though it does not have priority on Taunt. Sigilyph and Murkrow resist both of Exeggutor's STAB attacks but must be wary of Hidden Power Ice.</p>
