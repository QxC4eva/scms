[Overview]

<p>Ursaring might look bad at first glance, but he rarely disappoints on the battlefield. Thanks to his access to the combination of Swords Dance and Guts, the ferocious bear has enough power to tear his victims limb from limb. Moreover, he has perfect coverage with just three moves, and boasts two great abilities that complement his role as a physical sweeper perfectly. However, his lack of Speed and bulk severely hampers his effectiveness, so it may seem as though Ursaring is forced into a niche. He's often compared to Swellow, a fellow Guts Pokemon who has higher Speed and access to dual STABs, which may make Ursaring seem inferior. Lastly, with a variety of Fighting-types in the tier, Ursaring often has a hard time finding an opportunity to switch in. Overall, Ursaring is a mixed bag, and when played to his strengths, has no problem sweeping teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set combines Ursaring's access to a great ability, Quick Feet, with his amazing Attack stat. Thanks to these two attributes, he is both quick and strong. Facade is Ursaring's main STAB move, which deals huge amounts of damage when coupled with Toxic Orb. Close Combat hits Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon who resist his Normal-type STAB moves for super effective damage. Crunch nails Ghost-types who are immune to the rest of the moves on this set. With a Swords Dance under his belt and the Speed boost from Quick Feet, not much can stand in Ursaring's way. However, due to poor defenses, he can't always get off a Swords Dance, so Protect is an acceptable alternative to ensure that his Toxic Orb activates.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Jolly nature is recommended to outspeed everything up to unboosted base 108 Speed Pokemon, such as Galvantula. Toxic Orb is the only acceptable item choice, because Quick Feet doesn't nullify the Flame Orb's Attack-lowering effect like Guts would.</p>

<p>Ursaring is not that fast, so almost every Choice Scarf user in the tier (and even some naturally speedy Pokemon, such as Scolipede and Accelgor) can outspeed and KO him. Choice Scarf Medicham easily outpaces and can threaten Ursaring with its STAB Hi Jump Kick. Wynaut is a good teammate because it shares defensive synergy with Ursaring and can allow him to set up through Encore. Wynaut can also get rid of Choice Scarf Pokemon who would otherwise give Ursaring trouble. Paralysis support for Ursaring is appreciated, as he is not particularly fast; dual screens support lets Ursaring set up with ease. Entry hazard support is helpful as well, allowing Ursaring to nab OHKOs and 2HKOs that he wouldn't be able to get otherwise.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ursaring has a plethora of other options, but a majority of them are not viable simply because they are outclassed or provide no useful coverage. He is capable of using many boosting moves, such as Belly Drum and Work Up, but they are all outclassed by Swords Dance. Ursaring has access to other Fighting-type moves, namely Hammer Arm, Low Kick, and Superpower, but they are all inferior to Close Combat. Ursaring has perfect coverage in three moves, so many of his other options, such as the elemental punches, Stone Edge, and Seed Bomb, are not needed. Though slightly weaker, Night Slash could be used over Crunch if you feel very lucky about Ursaring's critical-hit ratio.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ursaring is very frail, so most priority attacks will either KO him or deal heavy damage. Hitmonlee can deliver a swift, powerful Mach Punch to deal heavy damage, and a Sucker Punch from Absol also dices up Ursaring. Even with a Quick Feet boost, Ursaring is still relatively slow, so any base 108 Speed Pokemon or higher can outspeed and KO him. Almost any Pokemon with a Choice Scarf and Speed investment can outspeed him as well, and end the bear's rampage. Sceptile and Choice Scarf Rotom-F are good examples of this, as they can outspeed and KO him with their powerful STAB attacks. Take note, however, that most Pokemon who are fast enough to outspeed Ursaring are generally too frail to survive a STAB Facade, and most Pokemon who are bulky enough to survive an attack are often too weak to deal very much damage to Ursaring; in most cases, if Ursaring sets up, you will lose at least one Pokemon.</p>
