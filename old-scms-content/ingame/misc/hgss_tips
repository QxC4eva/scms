<h2 name="speedy">Speeding up Happiness-based Evolution and Beauty</h2>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/upload/ingame/guides/hgss_daisy.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Daisy Oak gives a massage to one of your Pokemon between 3 and 4 PM (15:00 to 16:00) at the rival's house in Pallet Town in Kanto. This increases the Pokemon's happiness, as well as the Beauty stat by 32.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/upload/ingame/guides/hgss_bigbrother.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Big Brother in Goldenrod City gives one of your Pokemon a haircut on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday in the Underground Market. Doing this increases the Pokemon's happiness, as well as the Beauty stat by 32.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/upload/ingame/guides/hgss_littlebrother.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Little Brother in Goldenrod City gives one of your Pokemon a haircut on Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday in the Underground Market. Doing this increases the Pokemon's happiness by a lesser amount than Big Brother, as well as the Beauty stat by 32.</p>

<p>It takes 8 days to maximize Beauty, by which you can easily manipulate the time, making this a great way of evolving Feebas.</p>

<h2 name="npcs">Helpful NPCs</h2>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/upload/ingame/guides/hgss_hpman.png" alt="" /></div>

<h3 name="hp">Hidden Power Man</h3>
<p>Head to the prize building adjacent to the Celadon Game Corner. A man will tell you the Hidden Power type of a Pokemon in your party. This allows you to narrow down your IVs more quickly, as most IV calculators include this feature.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/media/upload/ingame/guides/hgss_ivman.png" alt="" /></div>

<h3 name="iv">IV Man</h3>
<p>To help narrow down your Pokemon's IVs even quicker, head to the main Battle Tower, where a man will tell you several different phrases that indicate your Pokemon's best IV(s), as well as the overall total of its IVs. Many IV calculators allow you to use these phrases, so this is extremely helpful in determining IVs. First, he will indicate the range for the total amount of IVs based on the following phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>'This Pokémon's potential is decent all around.' – Total: 0-90</li>
<li>'This Pokémon's potential is above average overall.' – Total: 91-120</li>
<li>'This Pokémon has relatively superior potential overall.' – Total: 121 - 150</li>
<li>'This Pokémon has outstanding potential overall.' – Total: 151 - 186</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, he will tell you your Pokemon's highest stat, at random if multiple IVs are the same, and give you a range for that stat based on the following phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>'It's rather decent in that regard.' – IV: 0-15</li>
<li>'It's very good in that regard.' – IV: 16-25</li>
<li>'It's fantastic in that regard.' – IV: 26-30</li>
<li>'It can't be better in that regard.' – IV: 31</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://metalkid.info/Pokemon/Calculators/IV.aspx">MetalKid's IV Calculator</a> is recommended for checking IVs, as it allows you not only input the Pokemon's stats, but also to input the parameters given to you by the Hidden Power man and the IV man. This helps narrowing down IVs more quickly, even at lower levels. It is especially helpful in verifying RNGed Pokemon, as most IVs will be identical.</p>
