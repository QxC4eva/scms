<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Aside from Smeargle, five Pokemon get this move: Exeggcute, Exeggutor, Chansey, Blissey, and Mew. Exeggcute and Exeggutor generally don't attack with physical moves, Chansey and Blissey don't attack in general, and Mew has many better moves to use. Therefore, this move has little competitive value.</p>
