Reveals the foe's item.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On switch-in, the opponent's held item is displayed. In multi battles, it randomly selects an opponent, and does not tell you which opponent was selected. Frisk will immediately activate whenever the ability is acquired, such as through <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This ability can be a nice benefit, since it uncovers the foe's held item, putting you one step ahead of your opponent, as you can accurately predict the opponent's set from the item it is holding before it has even had a chance to move. For example, <a href="/bw/pokemon/rotom-w">Rotom-W</a> holding a Choice item will likely use <a href="/bw/moves/trick">Trick</a> on you rather than a status move, or <a href="/bw/pokemon/latios">Latios</a> holding <a href="/bw/items/choice_specs">Choice Specs</a> will likely have <a href="/bw/moves/draco_meteor">Draco Meteor</a>. However, the ability's distribution is rather disappointing, as the ability is more or less limited to poor Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/stantler">Stantler</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/banette">Banette</a>, and even those Pokemon have better abilities to use. The only halfway decent Pokemon to receive the move is <a href="/bw/pokemon/yanmega">Yanmega</a>, through the Dream World, who already has two far better abilities to make use of instead.</p>
