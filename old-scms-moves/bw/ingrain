[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user recovers 1/16th of its max HP each turn and is prevented from switching. The move also prevents the user from being forced out by Circle Throw, Dragon Tail, Roar, and Whirlwind. The user can only leave battle if it faints or uses the move Baton Pass, U-turn, or Volt Switch. If it uses Baton Pass, the Pokemon that receives the pass also receives the effect of this move, so cannot switch out either. Using Ingrain causes the user to become susceptible to Ground-type attacks, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, even if it is Flying-type or has the ability Levitate, and also prevents Magnet Rise and Telekinesis from working. It does not, however, prevent the use of the moves Bounce, Fly, and Sky Drop.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Ingrain is a dubious move. While HP recovery is useful, the prevention of switching can be a major hindrance, leaving this move vastly outclassed by Leech Seed. However, Ingrain can be used on Smeargle in Baton Pass chains, anchoring the final recipient with whatever boosts its team members attained.</p>
