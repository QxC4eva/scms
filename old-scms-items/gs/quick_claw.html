<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gives the user a 23.4375% chance to go first. This only makes the Pokémon go first if it is using a move of the same priority as the other Pokémon. Higher priority moves will still always go before lower priority moves, regardless of Quick Claw. If both Pokemon hold this item and succeed in activating it, the first to move will be randomly chosen. Received from old woman in National Park.</p>
