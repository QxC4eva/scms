<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><em>Imagination is a sign of our humanity, whether it is expressed apocalyptically, erotically, or through multitudinous species of Pok&eacute;mon (Kelts 134).</em></p>

<p>In the monster-filled world of Pok&eacute;mon, there was an absence. Players considered the characters childish and sought to live out a more sinister fantasy. The game's designers paid attention to these cues and  introduced the Dark / Ghost-type hybrid in the game's third generation,  thus fulfilling many players' desires. There was now a Pok&eacute;mon with no weaknesses that allowed  players to take part in a more aggressive,  domination-based experience. The subsequent introduction of an additional Dark / Ghost-type Pok&eacute;mon in the fourth generation fully filled this void as the game had a Pok&eacute;mon described as 'evil' for the first  time. Even in a fantasy world the new characters defied what was  possible. Cohen's Monster Theses  suggest that individuals would crave  these new Pok&eacute;mon as cultures crave and create monsters. The designers of the Pok&eacute;mon universe delivered in kind.</p>

<p>The Pok&eacute;mon game series has developed through the introduction of new Pok&eacute;mon and new settings. Tsunekaz Ishihara, the president of Pok&eacute;mon Co., said, "The basic concept of the Pok&eacute;mon games has remained unchanged since the first release in 1996. But we have always strived to add new characters and upgrade games so that Pok&eacute;mon fans will never feel they are approaching an end" (Kelts 17). Since the primary purpose of Pok&eacute;mon in-game is to enrich the gameplay experience, new Pok&eacute;mon are introduced to fill any perceived void. The game has expanded with the introduction of new   lands and Pok&eacute;mon. Through his journey, the player must repeatedly battle against a designated rival, wild Pok&eacute;mon, and an evil group of Trainers. The player is set against insurmountable odds, such as the capture or discovery of extinct, legendary, or mythical  Pok&eacute;mon&mdash;but through perseverance, positivity, and hard work, players eventually beat the Pok&eacute;mon League Champion. The game contains features that resonate with hero-quest  stories on a basic level. The acceptability of the illogical and the ambiguous, the hero's sense of  duty above all else, the concepts of the  child as hero and of unending  quest, and the undependability of a happy ending are all represented in  Pok&eacute;mon folklore (Kelts 91). There  are 650 different Pok&eacute;mon in total, while only two have been introduced that inherently lack weaknesses.* The game's newest generation is soon to be released in Japan, and still there are no additional Dark / Ghost-type Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

<h2>The Introduction of Evil</h2>

<p>The introduction of Dark / Ghost-type Pok&eacute;mon filled a void in the Pok&eacute;mon universe. Tsunekaz Ishihara, the president of Pok&eacute;mon Co., stated, "Market  research conducted in the U.S. prior to the release of Pok&eacute;mon games found that the characters were too childish to catch the fancy of  Americans" (Kelts 91). In other words, the potential audience for the  games had needs and desires that were not being met. It could be assumed  that the makers of the game thought it wise to introduce a character that was the opposite of their  childish image. Instead of allowing  players to play subsequent  generations of the games as the evil human  characters, players were given the opportunity to use evil Pok&eacute;mon. The third generation of the games introduced this sinister character, the first Pok&eacute;mon to lack a weaknesses.</p>

<div class="float-right"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue26/monsters_spirits.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Pok&eacute;mon #302 is called Sableye.  Described in the anime as "The Darkness Pok&eacute;mon" (in the episode <em>Ready, Willing, and Sableye</em>), Sableye is a human-like character that hides in the darkness of caves. Its diet of gems has transformed its eyes into gemstones (Neves et  al., 164). The  fact that the character is human-like and lives in caves  reminds the  player of the unknown and the inherent fear associated.  Called to mind  are instances of cynocephali and werewolves in medieval  writings that were feared and persecuted because of their differences  from the  community (Pliny the Elder).</p>

<p>Sableye acts out the role of the trickster, even earning such an   ability in later iterations of the game. Introduced to the Pok&eacute;mon  community in an episode of the anime titled <em>Ready, Willing, and Sableye</em>,  we see the character finding delight in the fear of others. The episode   finds the antagonists discovering a Sableye in a cave while searching   for jewels. Upon seeing him they shout, "Ghost! It's a ghost!" As   Sableye laughs at their horror they go on to state, "Here we are   thinking we see a ghost, and Sableye thinks it's funny!" Sableye finds   joy in causing and witnessing the fear and anxieties of others. This   concept, summed up by the word  schadenfreude borrowed from German,  indicates that the makers of  Pok&eacute;mon created Sableye for the purpose of  having a sinister character.  Sableye eats gemstones, craving that which  humans crave, but for very  different reasons. This similarity to humans  is quite close, and draws  to mind the idea that Sableye lies at the gate  of difference, creating a  dangerous pollution of classification that  blurs the lines of cosmic  and social structure (Douglas 113).</p>

<p>As the first Dark / Ghost-type Pok&eacute;mon, Sableye filled the void created   by an enormous amount of characters that market research indicated were   too childish for American audiences (Kelts 93). Sableye, however, was   not a very strong Pok&eacute;mon. There was devilish mythology surrounding the   character, some classic ties to monster theory in the instances of   schadenfreude and category crisis, but in actual gameplay there were   elements lacking. Despite Sableye's similarities to cynocephali and   werewolves, players needed a character that did not just represent   domination, aggression, and schadenfreude&mdash;they needed a   character that would allow them to dominate.</p>

<p>Spiritomb was the four hundred and forty-second Pok&eacute;mon introduced.  The  game describes this amorphous being as a Pok&eacute;mon that was formed by  108  spirits, bound to a fissure in a rock as punishment for misdeeds  500  years ago (Neves et al., 237). Spiritomb is essentially a collection  of  evil spirits that behaves aggressively, causing senseless mayhem  while  attacking innocent villagers out of malicious desire. Although it  is  attached to a specific rock, it can travel throughout the land.  Much  like a poltergeist, Spiritomb haunts the living while tied to a  specific  place, committing mischievous acts (Burr 55–77). Sableye and  Spiritomb  share the Dark / Ghost typing,  but Spiritomb is more practical  for gameplay, more sinister, and  embodies the ideas of 'monster' more  fully. For the first time in its  history, a Pok&eacute;mon is described as  evil. No other Pok&eacute;mon in the game  is described in such a way with any  sense of permanence.</p>

<p>Like Sableye, the mythology of Spiritomb was introduced to audiences through an episode of the anime. In <em>The Keystone Pops!</em>,   a fun-loving Pok&eacute;mon breaks open a tomb while playing. Suddenly the  sky  darkens, the main character feels a chill, and ominous music begins  to  play, reminiscent of classic Hollywood monster films like  Frankenstein  or Dracula. There is thunder as lightning strikes the  ground. The  characters state, "There's something weird about this!" as  Spiritomb  emerges from the tomb with a voice akin to Bela Lugosi's  Dracula. The  characters are confused and frightened as they had never  seen a Pok&eacute;mon like this. The show states, "Spiritomb – The Forbidden  Pok&eacute;mon. As  punishment for misdeeds 500 years ago, it was imprisoned in  the fissure  of an odd keystone." The Spiritomb immediately attacks the  characters  before flying off to attack local villages. The townspeople  say, "The  evil Spiritomb has been reborn!" An elderly village woman  tells the main  characters of a hero arriving to defeat Spiritomb 500  years earlier  after it ravaged local villages.  The hero battled the  Spiritomb in an  effort to seal it away as a 'wicked Pok&eacute;mon' so  villagers could live  'happily ever after.' She says, "Spiritomb is one  mean and nasty  Pok&eacute;mon," and when asked of Spiritomb's motivation for  behaving in such a  way, she says that no one knows what lies in the "demonic depths of   Spiritomb's thoughts." Only when an opposing Pok&eacute;mon assumes   extraordinary powers in the company of  a mythical hero can the  Spiritomb be defeated. In defeat, the  Spiritomb is locked away in the  tomb from which it initially sprang.</p>

<h2>Cohen and Pok&eacute;mon</h2>

<p>With these introductions, players were given the opportunity to play   the games as inherently evil, aggressive, and dominating characters.   Against the Pok&eacute;mon, trainers could not use so-called super effective   attacks, such as when Water attacks are used on a Fire-type or Ice   attacks are used on a Grass-type. The  aggression and domination that could  be carried out as a result filled a  void with players as they could  enter a battle and not have to worry  that the opposing trainer would be  presenting a Pok&eacute;mon that possessed  attacks capable of causing  substantial damage. This took the guesswork  out of battling, and left  the player with a singular conclusion. If a Dark / Ghost-type  is strong  enough, it can defeat any other Pok&eacute;mon. There was an  elimination of  strategy as brute force was now an option. Like the  monster, the Pok&eacute;mon Trainers need not use intelligence; merely  instinct, desire, and  aggression to reach their ends&mdash;victory  in battle.**</p>

<p>The elimination of this gameplay void served to fill a monster void.   Until the introduction of Sableye and Spiritomb, there were Pok&eacute;mon that  looked evil, but none that were described as or behaved as such. The  'mean' Pok&eacute;mon, prior to the introduction of the Dark / Ghost-type,  looked  mean but did not behave this way. There were Pok&eacute;mon that would   occasionally misbehave, but none personified schadenfreude. Spiritomb   and Sableye each embody Cohen's monster theses so fully that it can  only  be concluded that their purpose in the game was to appeal to  player's  fears, take advantage of the human desire for monsters, and allow  for a domination-based gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Cohen states that the monster's body is a cultural body. He says  that  the monster is born only at a metaphoric crossroads of a certain   cultural moment&mdash;of a time, a feeling, or a place (Cohen 4). This is precisely the idea behind Spiritomb, who is only born from a   stone under very specific circumstances and at a specific place  to  behave as a monster. In Pok&eacute;mon Diamond, he cannot be caught until the player has spoken to thirty-two people underground, a place where there  are very few people. The player must partake in a journey to attract the attention of this evil Pok&eacute;mon, and only then can the player be given  the opportunity to battle the Spiritomb. Should the  player survive, he  is given the opportunity to catch the Pok&eacute;mon for his own use. The  monster's body incorporates fear, desire, anxiety, and  fantasy, giving  it life and an uncanny independence (Ibid). This is true of Spiritomb  and Sableye. Sableye lives in caves, feasts on gemstones, frightens all  comers for its own delight, and resides at its  base among the most  powerful Pok&eacute;mon in the game.** He is the  embodiment of Cohen's first  thesis.</p>

<p>Cohen says the monster always escapes (Ibid). Spiritomb is never   eliminated, merely locked away into a rock that is destined to be   broken, releasing the evil Pok&eacute;mon back into the world. Sableye is also   never eliminated, but tolerated. This Pok&eacute;mon appears with regularity  as  the player explores caves. When defeated, another Sableye will   eventually appear. Spiritomb is of particular interest here, as such an   evil and nasty creature that exists as a singularity would likely be   eliminated under normal circumstances, but that would defeat the purpose   of Spiritomb. Had the makers wished to add a level of fear to the game,  they could  have had the player battle this Pok&eacute;mon only. Upon its  defeat it would  disappear, leaving the player to carry on with the quest  for good and  all that is right. Instead, Spiritomb becomes a playable  character,  allowing the user to subject others to the fear of facing a  foe that  lacks weaknesses. There is no escape.  Pok&eacute;mon allows the player  to act as a hero charged with the task of  traveling throughout the world  collecting Pok&eacute;mon for a research  project run by a well-known  scientist. Over the course of this  collection, the player is to train  Pok&eacute;mon in order to become the best  Trainer in all the land culminating  in an epic battle with the "Elite  Four" and the "Pok&eacute;mon Champion"&mdash;the strongest Trainers in  the world. Even if the  player avoids the habitat of Spiritomb, the  final human opponent in the  fifth generation of the game possesses a  Spiritomb as her lead Pok&eacute;mon.  The monster and the hero are destined to  meet, and this fate can never  be avoided.</p>

<p>Monsters are disturbing hybrids whose externally incoherent bodies   resist attempts to include them in any systematic structuralism (Ibid 6). Sableye is human-like, yet feasts on gemstones. Spiritomb was once   human but is now amorphous, consisting of one hundred and eight evil   human spirits. The category crisis that is created by infusing evil Pok&eacute;mon with human  spirits, forms, and habits serves to strengthen the  player's understanding of these Dark / Ghost-type  Pok&eacute;mon as sinister or  evil. Spiritomb has a human-like face, but its  form is that of a  swirling mass of human souls, almost like one-hundred  and eight ghosts  within a ghost. This is precisely the idea behind  purgatory, as the  souls within Spiritomb are not alive as they once  were, though certainly  not dead. Instead,  they are eternally punished for their misdeeds  (Hanna). The human  qualities of Spiritomb have long since disappeared and  given way to  aggressive, demonic thoughts and actions.</p>

<p>Monsters are created through a process of fragmentation and   recombination in which elements are extracted "from various forms,"   including marginalized social groups, and then assembled as the monster  (Cohen 11). Spiritomb is the criminal, the personification of mischief   and evil deeds, an escaped mass of spirits in purgatory temporarily   avoiding their fate of eternal damnation. Sableye is the recluse,   residing alone in a distant place far from 'civilized' contact, like the   monsters of Beowulf. Some Pok&eacute;mon are clearly fish, deer, bears, mice,   bugs, or lizards, while Spiritomb and Sableye represent aspects of human  culture that  most view as negative, combined into a slightly human form  for the  purpose of domination-based gameplay. The game takes moderately  human  qualities and applies them to the most devastatingly powerful  creatures  to create an experience wholly unlike that of Pok&eacute;mon games  past. With  these characters, there was an introduction of evil,  aggression, and domination.</p>

<p>The monster is transgressive, a lawbreaker and so the monster and  all  that it embodies must be exiled or destroyed. The repressed,  however,  always seem to return. In as  much, the monster polices the borders of  the possibl (Ibid 12, 16).  Sableye and Spiritomb are the only Pok&eacute;mon that lack a weaknesses  and are both exiled from the Pok&eacute;mon population  because they are not  quite like the rest of the creatures in the  universe. They are  inherently less weak and possess unique  traits that  make their role in the game singular. In raising and  battling these  characters, players are given the opportunity to  dominate other  creatures and Trainers. Those that wish to participate  in an aggressive  experience are now able to do so using two Pok&eacute;mon that before the third  generation of the Pok&eacute;mon video game would have been totally  impossible.</p>

<p>The monster attracts. The same creatures who terrify and interdict  can  evoke potent escapist fantasies; the linking of monstrosity with  the  forbidden makes the monster all the more appealing as a temporary  egress  from constraint (Ibid 16, 17). In this lies the motivation for introducing Dark / Ghost-types into the Pok&eacute;mon universe. The president of  Pok&eacute;mon Co. stated that American audiences thought that Pok&eacute;mon were too  childish  in their initial foray into the market (Kelts 17). In response, Pok&eacute;mon were introduced that allowed the player to escape the childish  world  of Pok&eacute;mon into an aggressive, domination-based fantasy. Joy is found  in the forbidden, peace is found in escape. Players sought this experience; they longed to battle the childish with the demonic where  the childish Pok&eacute;mon have no chance of  survival. Some players long for domination, others for aggression. There was a market for this gameplay experience and the creators  reacted accordingly.</p>

<p>Monsters ask us to reevaluate our cultural assumptions about race,  gender, sexuality, our perception of difference, and our tolerance towards  its expression (Cohen 20). In a similar way, Dark / Ghost-type  Pok&eacute;mon have asked the player and gaming community to reevaluate their perceptions of the Pok&eacute;mon universe. This is not a world comprised solely of childish creatures, there is evil residing in the caves and in the acts of humans. This evil, the potential for domination and aggression, is present in the real world and should thus be present in the world of Pok&eacute;mon. Gamers were forced to recognize this in the   development of gameplay. It was no longer safe to assume all was   unconditionally well; players needed to  reevaluate what they thought of  the game, its creators, characters, and the role they sought to play.  Would the gamer succumb to the allure of the domination-based, aggressive gameplay experience?</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Dark / Ghost-type Pok&eacute;mon was introduced in the third generation of the game, quite possibly the  first completely developed after Pok&eacute;mon's  introduction to American  audiences. The first games had a multitude of childish creatures that  players could raise and battle and was  geared towards Japanese culture where tiny is cute, bright is adorable, and cuddly is ideal. U.S. market research showed that this was not the  case in American culture, and the makers of the game made adjustments as needed. These adjustments were minor in most respects, but major in the  introduction of a Pok&eacute;mon that lacked weaknesses and embodied monster  fantasy. Audiences were yearning for the opportunity  to play through the world of Pok&eacute;mon with aggressive characters who had  the potential for  domination. Players needed actual monsters in this  world of childish creatures. Cohen's monster thesis offer sufficient  evidence to prove the purpose of Sableye and Spiritomb. The monsters were created to satisfy  the needs of audiences to play out their  biggest fears in a safe place&mdash;the world of Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

<p>* It should be noted that some Pok&eacute;mon lack weaknesses due to their typing combined with their ability&mdash;Eelektross, for  example&mdash;and while this lack of weaknesses could  be considered  inherent, it is outside the realm of this research  because this ability  is secondary to the Pok&eacute;mon 's true nature. It is  akin to a person born  with brown hair. Surely it is part of that  person, but does not truly  affect the individual as say, an inability to catch a disease would.  This point could be debated at length, and I welcome all comments, but  it is perhaps most important to realize that this research was done  before Black and White were released. Therefore, at the end of the  day, Eelektross was omitted because it didn't exist. Could it be incorporated? It is likely.</p>

<p>** While it is the author's contention that this was truly the goal of   Game Freak in the creation of the characters, in practical terms this is   clearly not the case, as the competitive community has shown.</p>
