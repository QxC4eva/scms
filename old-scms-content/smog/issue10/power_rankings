<p>Smogon Power Rankings are based on the performance of players in official Smogon tournaments. With the schedule of official tournaments being full year around, these rankings will showcase the best players at the time. The higher someone is on the rankings means they have accomplished bigger and better things than the people below them. Time will also be factored into the equation. If someone wins an official tournament, they will stay near the top for a little bit and slowly fall as their accomplishments dwindle. These ratings are subjective and the opinion of one man. If you have any questions about the rankings, feel free to send the writer a Private Message.</p>
