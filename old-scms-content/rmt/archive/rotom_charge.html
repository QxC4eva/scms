<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/410.png" alt="" />
<strong>Roserade</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Toxic Spikes<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Leaf Storm</p>

<p>The strongest of leads! Actually usually only works against slower leads. But Sleep right from the get-go when most teams are pretty ill prepared to let anything go to sleep is always good. Also early Tspikes is very beneficial to my team as it helps me deal with some big threats and help out my main sweeper. Usually I only lay 1 layer down to begin with since I like the immediate 12% damage on things like ttar and infernape. The 2nd layer only comes later if I'm playing full stall. I don't like to let Roserade die early. So it's not a suicide lead per-say. However I don't like to use it lategame since it really is Salamence bait, a Pokemon that when wielded correctly is one of the few deuteronomys who can really give me problems. </p>

<strong>Latias</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Reflect<br />
- Recover<br />
- Roar</p>

<p>An odd set, but it really holds the team together. It provides me with a second fire resist that you'll see later that I lacked for a while and really bit me on the ass whenever Blissey got boomed on. Reflect/Roar is great on defensive Latias and if I get into a groove with Latias and I have some hazards up, my opponent can really be in a world of trouble. The speed is really what drew me to using Latias, as having a good revenge answer for Mixmence is something any stall team/semistall team needs. Sometimes if I'm feeling randy I'll even try and bait Mence into Fire Blast! Fuck Mence though...</p>

<strong>Blissey</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 202 HP / 252 Def / 56 SpA<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Softboiled<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Ice Beam</p>

<p>My personal favorite Pokemon in DPP. So useful in so many ways. Out of all the Blissey sets, this is probably my favorite. Stealth Rock gives Blissey something to do. Otherwise you just come in and wall something and force it out. So instead of using another Pokemon, probably solely for Stealth Rock, putting it on Blissey was definitely the right move. Blissey is probably one of the best SRers in DPP, being able to come in on almost every special attacker and get that free turn to set up SR. You can run into some problems when you face a boom happy opponent who booms on Blissey the second they see it. But oh well. The spread is meant to be extremely bulky on the defensive side. I'll ask that you please don't try nitpicking it. That's the Blissey spread I run and you telling me that Blissey needs special defense in DPP (it doesn't) isn't going to make me change it.</p>

<strong>Skarmory</strong> @ Leftovers / Shed Shell<br />
Ability: Keen Eye<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Whirlwind<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Brave Bird<br />
- Roost</p>

<p>Skarmory is cool. There's not really much to say about him. Skarmbliss still works wonders, but in a different way. I think the combination is more about setting up hazards and forcing switches with those hazards up more than it is about walling a majority of the metagame like they used to. Skarmory is my personal favorite spiker as I feel that Forretress has fell to the wayside a bit. Brave Bird so that I can serve as a better Gyarados answer for a bit. Leftovers vs. Shed Shell really just comes down to whether or not it's a tournament battle. Sometimes I forget to make the change to Shed Shell and it bites me in the ass though! Kevin Garrett runs Shed Shell when he uses this team on the ladder but I prefer the recovery from lefties since Magnezone is quite (surprisingly) rare. He says he wins more with shed shell though so maybe it's better overall!</p>

<strong>Rotom-H</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 56 HP / 252 SpA / 202 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting<br />
- Charge Beam</p>

<p>The strongest member of my team. Subcharge Rotom is definitely one of the best Pokemon in the current metagame. He's able to come in on several of his immunities and resisitances and set up a free sub and go to down from there. Most of the common rotom switchins have trouble dealing with Subcharge. I definitely don't have enough HP to take Blissey Ice Beams without the sub breaking...so that should probably be fixed. But I've honestly had that situation come up once in the entire time I've been using this team so I really haven't had the motivation to change it since I really like packing as much special attack as I can. I just wish Rotom was a little faster so I could outspeed jolly Lucario, but alas he is not! Rotom also serves as my spinblocker although he's not a very good one since if Starmie surfs or Forretress uses payback, I'm not going to be sticking around for too long.</p>

<strong>Jirachi</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Serene Grace<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Fire Punch<br />
- Iron Head<br />
- Thunderpunch</p>

<p>Jirachi is what I like to call a "failsafe." Gyarados has a DD and flinched Skarmory to death? Revenge with Jirachi! DDTar somehow pulled 2 DD's out of nowhere? Revenge with Jirachi! Salamence is a complete dickhead and used Dragon Dance? Hope it's not Jolly! I originally never even considered Jirachi as an option until I almost lost to a Gyarados that killed Skarmory, Flinched Rotom and MISSED Stone Edge against Zapdos. And then I saw my insane DDMence weakness and realized that I needed a catch-all Pokemon that could revenge all the biggest threats in DPP. Jirachi fits that bill. Iron Head is also a very nice cleanup move, allowing me to be a complete dick to my opponents by flinching them to death.</p>
