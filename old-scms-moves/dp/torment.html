[SHORT DESC]
Prevents the target from using the same move twice in a row.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Prevents the target from selecting a move that it used the previous turn. If the target is forced to select the same move twice in a row due to Choice Band, Choice Scarf, Choice Specs, Disable, Encore, Taunt, or not having any other moves with PP remaining, the target uses Struggle every other turn. Effect is lost when the target switches out.
