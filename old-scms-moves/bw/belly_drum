<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Belly Drum is the epitome of a high risk, high reward strategy. Setting the stage for a Belly Drum sweep is immensely difficult, but the sweep is quick and simple when all the right preparations are made. Common users of Belly Drum include Charizard, the fastest Belly Drum sweeper, and Linoone, the only Belly Drum sweeper with access to STAB priority. Charizard's usefulness as a Belly Drum user has faded since the introduction of Stealth Rock, but with proper Rapid Spin support can still sweep effectively. Linoone is gifted with ExtremeSpeed as an event move. This allows Linoone to rack up massive damage before the opponent can even attack.</p>
