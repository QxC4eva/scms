<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Rooms are an integral part of the sim; whether you're interested in a certain tier, or if you're a budding artist, we have a room for it! If you'd like to suggest a room, you can post a thread in the <a href="/forums/forums/room-suggestions.269/">room suggestions subforum</a>, but be sure to read up on <a href="/forums/threads/how-to-suggest-a-room-and-previously-suggested-rooms.3491714/">this thread</a> on how to suggest a room first. If you'd like to appeal a ban from a room, rather than posting in the Discipline Appeals subforum, you should contact a Room Owner of the room you were banned from&mdash;check below for the room name, and you can find the appropriate ROs of the room.</p>
