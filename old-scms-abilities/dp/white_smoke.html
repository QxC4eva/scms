[SHORT DESC]
Prevents the enemy from lowering this Pokémon's stats. Decreases wild encounter rate.
[LONG DESC]
<p>This ability blocks any reduction of the Pokémon's stats by the enemy. For instance, Pokémon with White Smoke are immune to Intimidate, but still receive the +2 Attack from Swagger. This does not prevent the Speed drop from Curse, the Attack and Defense drop from Superpower, or any other stat loss caused by the user. It also does not block the effects of Heart Swap, Guard Swap, or Power Swap.</p>

<p>When a Pokémon with this ability is first in the party, wild encounters have a lower chance of occurring.</p>
