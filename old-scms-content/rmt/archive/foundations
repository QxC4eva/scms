<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Heya, this is SilentVerse with another RU RMT, but this time, it's a joint RMT with DittoCrow. I made this team around mid March, after I took over Windsong's stall guide. Since I was going to RMT Dancing Free soon, I knew it would no longer be as effective as it had once been. Thus, I knew I would need a new team that would be just as effective, especially with the RU Tournament coming up. I almost always use balance, so that would be expected, and I didn't really feel like making a more offensive team, as I'm usually mediocre at using them, so I decided to make a strong stall team. Rarelyused is a metagame with so many offensive threats, and unfortunately, stall hasn't been as common as it should be, even though it truly is a very respectable playstyle. </p>

<p>The fun thing about making this team is that it was really inspired by a lot of different people, as their thoughts on certain Pokemon and use of the made me really consider using them for this stall team. The key to this team, like any stall team, is to counter offensive threats, while using available opportunities with Roselia and Steelix to set up their hazards, putting pressure on the opponent as they struggle to dent my walls. Of course, due to the sheer amount of threats that there are to cover in Rarelyused, I haven't been able to cover everything with this team as well as I'd like; in fact, there are certain Pokemon who, if they manage to wear down my counter enough, can easily rip through the team, and there's actually a couple of Pokemon who can tear this team apart with good prediction. Still, most threats are checked twice for insurance, and even those troublesome threats can be simply "played around", as some of the walls on this team are so bulky that even super effective hits will fail to KO, which gives me a bit of leeway for error. This team has peaked at #1 quite a few times, got me to Round 4 in the Rarelyused Tournament, and McMeghan used it to win against Leftiez in the Rarelyused Tournament finals. I also won the first Mini Rarelyused Tournament with this team!</p>

<p>Hey guys, this is DittoCrow presenting a joint RMT with SilentVerse. I originally made this team for The Rarelyused Tournament II. The way I build teams in RU is by attempting to cover all of the common threats in the tier. I like balance teams, so I tried to build another version of Balance Beam with a four Pokemon core. However, since Honchkrow and Sharpedo were banned, people substituted them with new threats, which made it much harder for a four Pokemon core to be successful. I needed a really solid team, so I began to study the most effective Pokemon, playstyles, and movesets. One thing that I had noticed, specifically from Zebraiken's Daylight, was that hazards were extremely efficient in wearing down the opposing team. I saw that pairing a Spikes user with two Ghost-types made sure that the opponent would never get the chance to Rapid Spin, so I started from there.</p>

<p>While eavesdropping in #neverused one day, I overheard an astounding fact: Misdreavus gets Heal Bell. This could work perfectly on a more defensive oriented balance team, as removing status from bulky teammates and sweepers is extremely frustrating for the opponent; Misdreavus would also serve as a spinblocker. When building the team, I noticed that my four Pokemon core could not be perfect if I had two Ghost-types, as they both had similar weaknesses. Then, I added a fifth bulky teammate to the core. At that moment I noticed that I had less than five major weaknesses on the threatlist, so I added a last Pokemon, which covered most of them, thus molding the team into a stall team. After I lost in the tournament, I decided to help SilentVerse train in the mountains. We first compared teams, and to our surprise, they were almost exactly the same! Only three Pokemon were different, and they all played very similar roles. Hopefully this RMT will be really interesting because it will show how two different teambuilding processes came together to form one awesome team! </p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/208.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Steelix</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Gyro Ball<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Roar</p>

<p>Steelix's massive bulk, access to Stealth Rock, and Steel typing are what make this guy worth a spot on this team. Steelix, in my opinion, is probably the most reliable Stealth Rock user in the tier, as his great Defense lets him consistently switch into most physical attackers to set up the hazard. However, Steelix also walls numerous lethal threats for this team, such as Aggron, Aerodactyl, Archeops, Bouffalant, Crustle, Drapion, Druddigon, Galvantula, Klinklang, Rotom, Scolipede, Scyther, and Uxie. However, it's not this team's primary physical wall since it's lack of reliable recovery makes it so much easier to wear this guy down than Poliwrath. Still, the fact that it acts as a nice secondary check to those Pokemon, and can tank powerful hits such as Archeops's Flying Gem-boosted Arcrobatics, which the rest of the team cannot handle, makes it a welcome addition to the team. Roar also lets it beat the Substitute abusing Pokemon that Poliwrath is unable to phaze out with Circle Throw, and it just helps this team take advantage of the entry hazards it and Roselia set up.</p>

<p>Steelix sets up Stealth Rock to complement Roselia's Spikes in wearing down the opposing team. Misdreavus prevents those hazards from being spun away, and can burn certain troublesome Pokemon to make it easier for Steelix to deal with them, and Misdreavus is immune to the Ground- and Fighting-type attacks that hit Steelix super effectively. Slowking laughs at specially offensive Fire-types that can try to switch in on Steelix, while Poliwrath can take on some physical threats, which makes it so that Steelix doesn't have to wall every physical threat for the team. Steelix also defeats Rock-types who enjoy switching into Cryogonal. </p>

<p>Every team needs a Stealth Rock user, and Steelix is one of the most reliable Stealth Rock users out there. With Ground / Steel typing, Steelix has a ton of resistances which give it time to set up or take hits for the team, especially from powerful threats such as Druddigon and Aggron. Steelix is also a great teammate because it counters Drapion, a huge threat that recently rose very high in the usage stats. Steelix works phenomenally with Poliwrath because together they check almost all physical attackers in RU, making this defensive core one of the best out there. Finally, Roar is one of the most important moves; because Steelix walls so many things, it will have a chance to Roar its counters out which will result in the opponent taking a lot of damage from the team's entry hazards. Steelix also works really well with Slowking, as they cover each other's weaknesses and take physical and special hits, respectively. Overall, Steelix is a great switch-in to many common threats and provides the important Stealth Rock that the team needs.</p>

<p><strong>Misdreavus</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Pain Split<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Heal Bell</p>

<p>Misdreavus provides a few roles to this team that make it one of the most important Pokemon for this team. First of all, it acts as both a spinblocker and a cleric for this team, and since Misdreavus is the only Ghost-type in RU and NU that has access to Heal Bell, it's presence on this team is necessary, especially considering so many of this team's Pokemon are crippled by status (and Poliwrath uses the unreliable RestTalk combination). Secondly, it's my premier check to Ground- and Fighting-type Pokemon courtesy of Levitate (which also makes her immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes) and its Ghost typing, which solidifies its spot on this team. Overall, Misdreavus checks a variety of RU Pokemon, including Accelgor, Bouffalant (the Speed EVs allow Misdreavus to always outspeed max Speed Adamant Bouffalant), Gallade, Hariyama, Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, Medicham, Poliwrath, Primeape, Rhydon, Sandslash, Scolipede, and Scyther, and it would be very difficult to replace her without revamping a large portion of the entire team.</p>

<p>Misdreavus compliments Roselia and Steelix well, as it stops Rapid Spinners such as Sandslash from removing the entry hazards that they spent the time to set up. Misdreavus does lose to Cryogonal and Swords Dance Kabutops though, but that's where Poliwrath comes in, since even though Poliwrath will cause those entry hazards to be spun away, he also makes it so that if they dare to spin on him, they will also faint when Poliwrath uses Circle Throw. Since Misdreavus lacks Leftovers recovery, Stealth Rock can also be irritating for it. Luckily, Cryogonal can Rapid Spin away those troublesome rocks, keeping Misdreavus as healthy as possible to take on those troublesome Fighting- and Ground-types and cure the team of status. Slowking also takes on the Fire-types that may attempt to switch into Will-O-Wisp, and provides a secondary check to Fighting-types to help ease the pressure on Misdreavus.</p>

<p>Misdreavus is the centerpiece of the team, spinblocking and curing the team of unwanted status conditions. She also makes a great physically defensive wall, as Eviolite boosts her Defense (and Special Defense) to high levels. Being a Ghost-type with Levitate, Misdreavus provides a ton of resistances for the team, most importantly to Fighting-type moves. She rounds off the defensive core, and is one of the most useful members on the team due to Heal Bell. I cannot tell you how many times Heal Bell has saved my walls from dying to status effects! It is, however, hard to keep her alive, as Pain Split is somewhat unreliable so you need to play carefully. Still, Will-O-Wisp allows her to cripple strong physical attackers, namely Bouffalant (who, with an Adamant nature and max Speed, is outsped by one point with the given EV spread) and Fighting-types. Finally, with Heal Bell, Misdreavus can not only cure the burns and poisons that a stall team hates, but also Poliwrath's sleep which can be necessary in order to check opposing threats. I originally used a specially defensive version of Misdreavus, but the physically defensive variant checks many more threats. While Misdreavus is an important member of the team, I would probably replace her with Cofagrigus if I had another Cleric. </p>

<p><strong>Poliwrath</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Water Absorb<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Scald<br />
- Circle Throw<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>

<p>Yup, this is Dittocrow's Poliwrath set, and it's just such a pivotal member of this team. Poliwrath is a fairly underrated Pokemon at the moment, when really, it shouldn't be. It's typing is fantastic, and it's defenses allow it to take on so many mons, including Aggron, CRAWDAUNT, Drapion, Feraligatr, Klinklang, Kabutops, Rhydon, Jynx, Smeargle, Bouffalant, Aerodactyl, Crustle, and so many others. It is my main answer to those Pokemon in most cases since it, unlike Steelix, actually has recovery in the RestTalk combination, which generally allows it to stick around for quite a while, especially with Misdreavus's Heal Bell support. Poliwrath also happens to be my team's main phazer, and between burns from Scald and damage racked up by Circle Throw and entry hazards, Poliwrath becomes a vital part of this stall team.</p>

<p>Poliwrath acts as this team's primary physical wall, sponging attacks from the likes of Choice Band Drapion for the rest of the team. In return, Roselia and Cryogonal take on the pesky Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon who plague Poliwrath. Roselia also supplies Spikes to make Circle Throw all the more deadly. Slowking stops those Psychic-types from crushing Poliwrath with their attacks, and can Toxic walls that Poliwrath cannot wear down with Circle Throw. Steelix sets up Stealth Rock and deals with the likes of Archeops and other such threats, who Poliwrath is unable to deal with. Steelix can also Roar out Substitute abusing Pokemon who Poliwrath cannot phaze out with Circle Throw. Misdreavus can awaken Poliwrath when he sleeps with Heal Bell, which helps him stick around for much longer.</p>

<p>Poliwrath is no doubt one of the best physical walls in RU. It brings much needed resistances to Water-, Fire-, and Rock-type attacks and also checks a huge amount of both offensive and defensive threats with Scald. Scald has a huge 30% burn rate, allowing Poliwrath to cripple offensive foes such as Drapion, Kabutops, and Gallade, as well as defensive threats such as Qwilfish, Tangrowth, Dusknoir, and Spiritomb. This will also help Cryogonal to spin, as a burned Dusknoir or Spiritomb will not be doing much to Cryogonal despite its poor Defense stat. Poliwrath is another great counter to Drapion and Aggron as well as a counter to many other upcoming threats such as Feraligatr, Sandslash, and Steelix. With Circle Throw, Poliwrath not only hits certain defensive threats such as Clefable and Cryogonal, but also allows Poliwrath to phaze the opponent, racking up even more entry hazard damage. Sadly, Rest is Poliwrath's only form of recovery, but with Sleep Talk and Heal Bell from Misdreavus, Poliwrath can continue to burn and phaze the opponent! </p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/315.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Roselia</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 236 SpD / 24 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Sludge Bomb<br />
- Rest</p>

<p>In my opinion, Roselia is hands down the best defensive Spiker in RU, as it single-handledly deals with threats such as Life Orb Tangrowth (the given EVs ensure that Roselia will outspeed standard offensive Tangrowth, which lets Roselia quickly dispatch it with Sludge Bomb), Life Orb Sceptile, Lilligant, Rotom-C, Rotom, Galvantula, Manectric (watch out for Overheat), Whimsicott, and various other threats which are otherwise difficult for this team to deal with, while also providing Spikes to help wear down the opposing team. Roselia actually makes those Grass-types a welcome sight on the opponent's team, since they basically give me a free layer of Spikes whenever they switch in. Furthermore, thanks to Natural Cure and Rest, Roselia can actually set up on a ton of defensive Pokemon, including Cofagrigus, Clefable, Lanturn, and Poliwrath, as Roselia can just set up as many Spikes until she's close to fainting, then Resting up to remove all the damage and status she's been inflicted with while she set up Spikes. </p>

<p>Roselia is necessary to take on the Grass-types that can easily switch into Steelix, Poliwrath, and Slowking. These three in return take on other troublesome Pokemon for Roselia; for example, Poliwrath and Steelix wall Drapion who may attempt to set up on Roselia, while Slowking deals with specially offensive Fire-types who want to switch into Roselia. Steelix also can set up Stealth Rock to accompany the Spikes that Roselia sets up. Misdreavus prevents Rapid Spinners from removing the entry hazards she works so hard to set up, while Cryogonal itself can Rapid Spin to those pesky entry hazards that chip away at Roselia's health, and gives me a secondary answer to those Grass-types so that I don't have to use Roselia for everything.</p>

<p>You've already seen the best physical walls in RU, so here's one of the best special walls in RU! Grass / Poison typing is a great typing which gives Roselia many important resistances to Water-, Fighting-, and Grass-type attacks, and with Eviolite, she will be taking almost nothing from non-super effective special attacks. I chose Roselia because as I was going through the threat list, I noticed that she checked nearly half of the special attackers in the tier! She also brought Spikes to the table, one of the most appreciated moves on a stall team. With Giga Drain, Roselia can take on strong Water-types such as Omastar and Poliwrath, and with Sludge Bomb, she can annihilate powerful Grass-types such as Sceptile, Lilligant, and Tangrowth and do it all over again with the wonderful combination of Rest and Natural Cure. Roselia is no doubt one of the best special walls in the tier and maybe even one of the best Spikes users! </p>

<p><strong>Slowking</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 144 Def / 116 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Slack Off<br />
- Scald<br />
- Psyshock</p>

<p>Slowking is this team's safety net. While he isn't REALLY necessary to deal with anything in particular, bar Moltres and other specially offensive Fire-types, he's useful simply because he gives this team a secondary check to a ton of Pokemon. Entei, Klinklang, Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, Moltres, Medicham, Typhlosion, Magmortar, opposing Slowking, Hariyama, Mesprit, Omastar, and so many other Pokemon can be dealt with by Slowking if necessary, which makes things a lot easier on my primary counters to those Pokemon. Slowking is also this team's sole user of Toxic, which allows me to beat certain walls, such as opposing Slowking and Tangrowth, much more easily. Slowking also makes prediction much easier thanks to Regnerator, as it basically means that I can toss it into most attacks if I don't know what the opponent is going to do, watch as Slowking lives the hit, then respond accordingly.</p>

<p>Slowking deals with Moltres, who can switch into all the other Pokemon on this team with ease, and proceed to stall it out with Toxic. In return, Steelix and Poliwrath take on those pesky Pursuit-trappers that give Slowking a hard time; Steelix also sets up Stealth Rock to make Moltres even less of an issue. Roselia smashes those Grass-types that like to switch into Slowking, while Cryogonal keeps the field clean of hazards so that Slowking can consistently defeat Moltres. Misdreavus provides cleric support to cure Toxic that might be inflicted on Slowking by the likes of Entei.</p>

<p>Slowking is virtually necessary for any team that doesn't want to get swept by Moltres or Typhlosion. I noticed how Cryogonal and Roselia together checked almost every special attacker in RU, but they shared a common weakness to Fire-type moves, and Poliwrath was too weak on the special side to watch over them. Then I noticed Slowking, who took care of the final weaknesses and provided great team support. With reliable recovery in Slack Off as well as the Regenerator ability, Slowking can take many hits from even physical attackers such as Entei and shrug them off with ease. It is also one of the best counters to Choice Specs Slowking, another huge threat on the rise. With Toxic, my own Slowking can wear down these threats making it hard for the opponent to recover due to hazards and status conditions. Scald is the obligatory STAB move, preventing threats such as Rhydon and Aggron from switching in safely. Psyshock disposes of strong special walls such as Roselia and Cryogonal by taking advantage of their weaker Defense stat; this helps to prevent hazards and keep my hazards on the field. Psyshock is also great for dealing with Calm Mind Entei and Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan. Slowking is becoming less and less useful, especially due to the new threats that BW2 brought, but he is still a great teammate and I couldn't ask for more!</p>

<p><strong>Cryogonal</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 168 Def / 92 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Recover<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Haze</p>

<p>Honestly, Cryogonal is probably my favorite Pokemon in the current metagame. It's a fabulous check against the omnipresent OTR Cofagrigus, and unlike stuff like Himonchan, Cryogonal can actually beat it one-on-one, which ensures that it can Rapid Spin away the troublesome entry hazards that usually accompany OTR Cofagrigus. It's also lovely that Cryogonal has Levitate, as it means that it doesn't get worn down by Spikes, as opposing entry hazards can be fairly troublesome for this team, so it would suck if my Rapid Spinner were to get worn down by them! Cryogonal also serves as my back-up check to most specially offensive mons, such as Manectric, Rotom, Sceptile, Tangrowth, SubCM Uxie (non-Psyshock variants), Rotom-C, and a bunch of other mons, though because most of these Pokemon have a way to hit Cryogonal hard, it's not this team's premier special wall unless Roselia has gone down (not to mention that Pursuit trappers are awful for it, though my EV spread helps alleviate that as it ensures that Cryogonal will always survive Choice Band Spiritomb's Pursuit if Cryogonal switches). Still, Cryogonal's ability to act as a secondary check against most special attackers while spinning away hazards is something that's irreplaceable for this team.</p>

<p>Cryogonal is an easy switch in for Pokemon like Entei and Aggron, as Ice Beam does pitiful damage to them. Poliwrath thus shares excellent synergy with Cryogonal, as it takes on those two troublesome Pokemon with ease. Similarly, Misdreavus and Slowking beat the Fighting-types that might try to switch into Cryogonal, and they can status opponents to help Cryogonal stall out Pokemon such as Cofagrigus, and Misdreavus can sometimes manage to burn Drapion and Spiritomb, which makes it makes life much easier for Cryogonal, as it no longer has to fear Pursuit from them. Roselia and Steelix can also set up entry hazards to wear down opposing spinblockers, making it easier for Cryogonal to successfully Rapid Spin. </p>

<p>Since I first used Cryogonal, it was love at first sight. Cryogonal is no doubt the best spinner in RU. People have started noticing the rise of Cryogonal, so they try to counter it with spinblockers such as Spiritomb. However, they fail to realize that there are some obvious ways of getting around that, such as changing Cryogonal's EV spread. With 248 HP / 168 Def / 92 SDef, Cryogonal will always survive Choice Band Spiritomb's Sucker Punch or Pursuit upon switching out. It will also take hits such as Scyther's U-turn or Feraligatr's Aqua Jet, allowing for a free turn to spin. This allows it to beat nearly all Ghost-types one-on-one except for Dusknoir, who will usually be burned thanks to Poliwrath. It's also great that Cryogonal beats the most common Ghost-type and offensive threat, Cofagrigus, with Haze. Haze is also really useful against Pokemon such as Magneton with Charge Beam, Sigilyph, Lilligant, Jynx, and Calm Mind Mesprit. However, I will usually have to switch Roselia into threats such as Manectric or Lilligant first because Cryogonal is a bit weaker on the special side with this EV spread. Cryogonal can still check these threats if Roselia is down, but with less success due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Then again, Levitate gives Cryogonal immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, a great asset for any spinner. Cryogonal is definitely irreplaceable, as no other spinner in RU can reliably spin and counter so many threats. </p>
