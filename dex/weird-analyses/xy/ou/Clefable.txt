Overview
########

Generation after generation, Clefable has languished in the shadows of its many contemporaries, but no more is this the case, as Clefable's astronomical rise to OU super-stardom is attributed to its brand-spanking, new Fairy typing. Two phenomenal abilities in Magic Guard and Unaware allow it to take on a multitude of roles including two different Calm Mind sets, a physical, and special wall. With Unaware, Clefable is able to effortlessly halt a significant quantity of boosting sweepers and even use such sweepers as setup bait, whereas Magic Guard works fantastically in negating every form of residual damage, making it an incredibly dangerous Pokemon for stall-based teams and quite tricky to wear down. That's not all, with a movepool that quite literally stretches out to the end of the cosmos, Clefable is able to execute these many sets with extraordinary proficiency and versatility. Furthermore, Clefable's amazing movepool (both supportively and offensively) along with its outstanding abilities makes it the perfect glue 'mon to many teams, easily stitching the holes in teams that struggle with top-tier threats such as Manaphy, Thundurus, and the various Fighting- and Dragon-types inhabiting the OU tier. Another advantage to Clefable's versatility is how arduous it is to even counter, as with the correct move, it can cripple or even KO just about any Pokemon in the game. In stark contrast to how vast Clefable's movepool is, its stats pale in comparison. With not a single base stat toppling over 100, it is quite apparent that Clefable must often specialize in two stats at most in order to achieve the highest success rate for any of its sets. While Clefable's typing is unquestionably good, its mediocre defenses can only take it so far. This flaws becomes moreso evident when Clefable is compared to bulkier supporters such as Chansey, which unlike Clefable, has the raw bulk to take on the likes of Mega Charizard-Y and Landorus. In conclusion, Clefable's claim to fame is this: at any moment of the battle, Clefable's sheer unpredictability gives its user a distinct advantage over their opponent; the ability to completely change the tide of the match with a surprise move is invaluable, given that the amount of tricks Clefable can pull out of its hat is as nearly as endless as the universe itself.

Unaware + Calm Mind
########
name: Unaware + Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Moonblast
move 3: Moonlight / Wish
move 4: Heal Bell / Flamethrower / Protect
ability: Unaware
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 244 Def / 12 Spe

Moves
========
Calm Mind is where the magic happens, as it allows Clefable to pose an offensive threat after a few boosts while also making it difficult to take out with special attacks. Moonblast is Clefable's most reliable STAB move, and it's also good to note that at the beginning of the match, it's better to go for Moonblast as opposed to Calm Mind, as it will be useful in wearing down many of Clefable's switch-ins such as Bisharp and Aegislash. With Wish + Protect Clefable is able to keep itself healthy as it uses Calm Mind, while also acting as a key team player. However, despite the unappealing PP of Moonlight and its effects under sandstorm, it's also a good recovery option as it can be used instantly and free up a moveslot. In that moveslot, Heal Bell works superbly in removing the threat of Toxic and other status, whereas Flamethrower can prove to be especially handy when dealing with Steel-types such as Scizor, Mega Mawile, Skarmory, and getting the quick KO at +1 against slower Steel-types such as Ferrothorn. One other alternate coverage move that Clefable can make use of is Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball grants excellent neutral coverage with Moonblast and it allows Clefable to muscle past Heatran in a more efficient fashion.

Set Details
========
Unaware is what gives this set its distinct flavor, as it allows Clefable to accomplish impressive feats by using boosted set up sweepers such as +6 Manaphy and +6 Azumarill as setup bait. With Unaware, this set is also guaranteed to come out on top versus just about relevant Calm Mind user in OU. 12 Speed EVs are used to outpseed minimum Speed Tyranitar, allowing Clefable to set up on it with minimal difficult, and the rest of the EVs and a Bold Nature specialize into Clefable's Physical Defense stat for two reasons: the first of which is that Calm Mind already patches up Clefable's uninvested Special Defense stat, so any Special Defense investment is just flat-out redundant, and the second is that with these EVs, it can effectively set up a lot more comfortably when up against physical attackers such as Dragonite, Conkeldurr, and defensive Landorus-T while not being thrown for a loop when up against powerful Psyshock users such as Latios.

Usage Tips
========
This set is meant to fill two simultaneous roles: the first of which is that Clefable acts as a fantastic check to a multitude of set up sweepers courtesy of Unaware, while acting as a solid late-game win condition with Calm Mind. This Clefable should be played as a defensive Pokemon at the start of the match and only go for a Calm Mind sweep mid- to late-game, as that point, that's when its many checks and counters are properly weakened. On the other hand, with its solid defenses, it can counter or check following set up sweepers at the earlier stages of the match: Swords Dance Talonflame, Belly Drum Azumarill, Calm Mind Suicune, Tail Glow Manaphy, Swords Dance Garchomp, Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Nasty Plot Thundurus, and many more. It's also key to note that this Clefable will always come out on top against opposing Calm Mind users, so there's little to fear when up against such threats, and in fact, it's in Clefable's best interest to set up against those types of Pokemon. While it's better to save Calm Mind for when Clefable can sweep, the move can be useful in that it pumps up Clefable's Special Defense, allowing it to better deal with more powerful offensive threats such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Mega Gardevoir.

Stall- and bulky offense-based teams is where this Clefable thrives. Most of the time, it is key to not reveal Calm Mind until the later stages of the match; in other words, fool your opponent into thinking that it's merely a defensive set, as in that case, they're less likely to play carefully with their Clefable check(s) due to the fact that it might not pose an offensive threat. Something to keep in mind is that it's best not to mindlessly switch Clefable into Trick users, even those that it normally counters. Likewise, when up against these threats one-on-one, it's good to scout their move with Protect should they choose to stay in. Protect is also good to use to ease pivot switching, accumulate Leftovers recovery, and in general, play mind games with your opponent. Unlike other Pokemon that rely on Protect, Clefable does not have to fear most set up sweepers, as the only thing to watch out for when using the move is giving your opponent a free chance to set up entry hazards.

Team Options
========
It is good to note the type of team you're trying to build and how you plan to accommodate the addition of Clefable with it, as Clefable has two types of partners: partners that fit on more offensively-inclined teams and partners that fit on stall-based teams. In regards to offensive Pokemon that pair well with Clefable, there includes quite the selection: Keldeo, Aegislash, Gyarados, Mega Gyarados, the Landorus formes, Kyurem-B, Talonflame, Latios, and Latias.

Keldeo benefits Clefable by being able to deal with Heatran, Bisharp, and many other Steel-types; in return, Clefable can easily counter Latios and Latias, two Pokemon that Keldeo struggles with. Aegislash is also a good partner, as it can Pursuit-trap pesky special walls such as Chansey, while luring out both Heatran and Bisharp and then smacking the two with Sacred Sword. Furthermore, Clefable helps Aeigslash by countering Mandibuzz and effectively dealing with Garchomp. Gyarados and Mega Gyarados also make good partners, as they can deal with Heatran, Aegislash, Bisharp, and Excadrill, whereas Clefable can deal with Thundurus, Rotom-W in the case of Gyardos, and Fighting-types such Conkeldurr in the case of Mega Gyarados. In addition, it can provide Wish support to all its partners, thus increasing their overall longevity. Do note, however, that these pairings struggle a tad with Mega Venusaur, so if your team already has issues with it, it's best not to stack on any more weak links.

Landorus functions rather well with Clefable for its ability to demolish every OU Steel-type with Earth Power, as well as being able to eradicate Mega Venusaur into oblivion with Psychic. To compensate, Clefable can take down Mandibuzz, Latios, and Latias, all Pokemon that are a pain in Landorus' side. Landorus-T can also work for similar reasons; however, its Intimidate ability allows it to better come out on top against Excadrill and Talonflame, though it does have a tough time with Rotom-W and Manaphy, which Clefable can thankfully deal with. In order to aid Clefable in its sweep, it is key to substantially weaken the opposing team's defensive cores, this is where Kyurem-B comes in. Courtesy of Mold Breaker, Kyurem-B can destroy Rotom-W with Earth Power and hit Mega Venusaur super effectively with Ice Beam. Kyurem-B also loves Clefable's ability to deal with Dragon- and Fighting-types that constantly threaten it. Although, all three of these cores detest Bisharp, and Kyurem-B + Clefable is especially weak to Excadrill.

A Pokemon that threatens to stop this set cold is Mega Venusaur, as such, Latios and Latias can work as effective partners to deal with Mega Venusaur along with other less common Poison-types. In the case of Latios, it can lure out and substantially weaken Heatran and Bisharp with Earthquake, making it easier for Clefable to pull off a late-game sweep. Both of these Pokemon can provide Defog support, which can be quite useful to deter the threat of entry hazards. Clefable can also support Latios and Latias by acting as a bulwark for Dark- and Dragon-type moves. While these pairs struggle a bit with Aegislash among other Steel-types, Clefable can team up with Talonflame, a Pokemon that can beat both Steel-types and Mega Venusaur. For Talonflame, Clefable can deal with Rotom-W, and for all three, it can work as a solid switch-in to Tyranitar.

In terms of stall-based partners, Clefable pairs especially well with Quagsire, Gliscor, or Hippowdon. Quagsire and Clefable can form a vicious Unaware core, as Quagsire can counter Mega Charizard-X, Scizor, and Bisharp, all physical attackers that Clefable struggles with. Hippowdon can work for similar reasons, but its improved bulk allows it to beat Aegislash and be better equipped to take on Mega Mawile and Talonflame. Furthermore, Hippowdon can provide Stealth Rock support, making it easier to wear down Clefable's checks. In contrast to Quagsire and Hippowdon, Gliscor can function as an effective status sponge once Toxic Orb has activated, meaning that it has an easier time switching in on the likes of Heatran and Chansey. For all three of these, Clefable can easily deal with Manaphy, Thundurus, Gyarados, and most Kyurem-B. Just note that Mega Venusaur is a hindrance to all these Pokemon, so it's advisable to carry another Pokemon that can deal with it.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Moonblast
move 2: Wish
move 3: Protect
move 4: Heal Bell / Toxic
ability: Unaware
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 244 Def / 12 Spe

Moves
=======
Moonblast is Clefable's compulsory STAB, as its great neutral coverage and solid base power does well in wearing down bulky targets such as Rotom-W. With the combination of Wish + Protect, Clefable can work as a solid wish passer for stall- and balanced-based teams. Protect also does well in garnishing leftovers recovery, allowing a worn out Clefable to avoid a potential 2HKO. Heal Bell allows Clefable to act as a reliable cleric for its team, whereas Toxic works well in crippling bulky threats that have recovery or targets that Clefable fails to even 3HKO, such as Hippowdon.

Stealth Rock may be used in the last slot should your team need a reliable entry hazard setter. Due to Clefable's ability to force switches upon Dragon- and Fighting-types as well as its ability to beat common Defog users such as Latios and Mandibuzz, it can find plenty of time to set up Stealth Rock and even discourage counter measures for the move. Thunder Wave is also an option in the last slot, as Clefable can cripple a few common switch-ins such as Bisharp, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard-Y.

Set Details
========
12 Speed EVs are used to get the jump on minimum Speed Tyranitar. The set is geared more towards physical defenses, as it allows Clefable to better deal with the likes of Garchomp and Terrakion. Should your team have a proper way of dealing with boosting sweepers, Clefable may forgo Unaware in exchange for Magic Guard. Due to its immunity to all forms of passive damage, it makes Clefable a much more efficient Wish pass. Magic Guard also gives Clefable more flexibility in its moveslots, as it can now run Soft-Boiled for recovery, giving it an extra moveslot to support its teammates with or utilize a coverage move such as Flamethrower. Do note, however, that the entire allure towards using defensive Clefable is to remove the threat of set up sweepers, you'll find that by removing Magic Guard, not only does Clefable lack the ability to counter Pokemon its supposed to, but its sheer passiveness allows a multitude of bulky threats to set up on it.

Usage Tips
========
- Best used on balance and stall teams; can be brought near any stage of the match and be effective.
- This set is used to check / counter a large portion of physical Fighting- and Dragon-types within the the tier.
- Can be brought in to wall Mega Garchomp, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragonite, Mega Medicham, Swords Dance Talonflame, and many more threats.
- Unaware is best used to check the above threats, as it ignores their boosts.
- magic guard should be used to take down the likes of latios and latias, both of which haven no chance to take clefable down due to how impervious it is to residual damage
when utilizing magic guard this clefable can also be an effective stop to many stallbreakers such as sableye

Team Options
========
- Hippowdon pairs very well with this clefable, as it is able to take on powerful Steel-types such as Bisharp with ease while providing Stealth Rock support. In return, Clefable can check physical Water-types that plow throw Hippowdon and provide cleric support.
- Skarmory can also provide the above support in addition to setting up Spikes and being able to phaze should Clefable lack Unaware.
Special walls such as Chansey and Blissey pair well with Clefable by being able to tank most special attacks with ease; in return Clefable can sponge Fighting-type moves from the likes of Terrakion.
- Mandibuzz works as an effective partner by being able to deal with Scizor and Aegislash; in return, Clefable can take weaker special attacks aimed at Mandibuzz and provide cleric support.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Moonblast
move 2: Wish
move 3: Protect
move 4: Heal Bell / Toxic
ability: Unaware
item: Leftovers
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 Spe

Moves
========
No Clefable can go without Moonblast, and this one is no exception, as the move is far too useful in taking out the Pokemon Clefable is supposed to counter, such as Greninja. This Clefable is meant to act as a key team player on stall or balanced teams; as such, Wish is its preferred method of recovery. Together with Protect, it works quite reliably in healing Clefable. Heal Bell allows Clefable to shrug off Toxic and is an almost mandatory move to have on stall teams. Toxic on the other hand can also work should your team have another cleric, as the moves does quite well in wearing down the likes of Deoxys-D. Stealth Rock can be used on the last slot should your team need it; likewise, Thunder Wave can also find use by crippling the likes of Mega Charizard-Y, Gengar, and Mega Gardevoir on the switch, all Pokemon that Clefable struggles to deal with. Furthermore, there often times where Thunder Wave is more effective than Toxic. When it comes to crippling Swift Swim users such as Ludicolo or fast threats such as Life Orb Deoxys-S, paralysis is much more appreciated for immediately stripping away their offensive pressure.

Set Details
========
Investment in Special Defense is used to counter / check special-boosting sweepers such as Manaphy, the Thundurus formes, Latias and Latios, Goodra lacking a poison move, other specially based Dragon-types, Nasty Plot Togekiss, Life Orb-less Volcarona, Keldeo, and certain Tornadus-T. Magic Guard can also work over Unaware so that Clefable becomes impervious to status and residual damage; however, Unaware is key to Clefable's success if it wants to stop special boosting sweepers. Clefable can also run Stealth Rock if its needed, but Heal Bell has a smaller distribution and thus gives Clefable more utility.

Usage Tips
========
- This set has many applications: it functions as a cleric/toxic staller, wish passer, special wall, and sometimes a stop to certain physical attackers.
- This set best thrives in stall / balanced teams as it can pass wishes to teammates that lack recovery and cure them of status ailments.
- The ability to wish pass makes it all the more useful for Clefable's partners to help support it; for instance, when Clefable uses wish the very turn a Steel-type check such as Aegislash shows up, then the wish makes it easier for a partner such as Landorus-T to come in and tank the hit.
- On top of being able to effectively check/counter most specially based set up sweepers, this Clefable can also check certain physical attackers such as Dragonite, Garchomp, Lucario lacking a steel move, and Zygarde.
- Do note that this Clefable shouldn't be brought in directly on these types of Pokemon, as the lack of physical investment can make it difficult; rather, it's better to utilize it as a soft check against these sort of threats.

Team Options
========
- It appreciates Pokemon that can deal with Poison-types and Steel-types in general.
- Excadrill is fantastic at doing so and provides Stealth Rock support.
- Skarmory also works rather well and phase and set up other entry hazards.
- Forms a superb defensive core with Mega Aggron, as it can give it Aromatherapy and Wish support, while Mega Aggron can easily take on the likes Mega Mawile and Bisharp.
- Heatran also works as an effective partner; the two can together check many specially based attackers. Heatran benefits Clefable serving as a good check to most Steel- and Poison-types as well as being able to set up Stealth Rock. Clefable aids Heatran by passing it wishes and dealing with pesky special Water-types that scare Heatran out.
- Landorus-T also works as an effective partner for similar reasons to the above

Magic Guard + Calm Mind
########
name: Magic Guard + Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Moonblast
move 3: Flamethrower
move 4: Soft-Boiled
ability: Magic Guard
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 244 Def / 12 Spe

Moves
========

Calm Mind bolsters Clefable's special stats, allowing it to both withstand special attacks with greater ease, as well as dish out moderately strong attacks of its own after a few boosts. Moonblast is a must with any Clefable really, as it is its most reliable STAB. Some key benchmarks to keep note of is that Clefable must have two boosts to OHKO Latias, Assault Vest Conkeldurr, and Mandibuzz. Flamethrower does well in destroying most Steel-types. For instance, after a single boost, it OHKOes all of Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Soft-Boiled is absolutely necessary to keep Clefable healthy as it sets up.

Set Details
========
While Life Orb might seem like a strange choice, the fact that Clefable is impervious to passive via Magic Guard, which includes Life Orb recoil, along with its access to reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled lessens the need for Leftovers. With a Life Orb, Clefable is able to achieve KOs it wouldn't have otherwise such as Latias and Conkeldurr at +1 with Moonblast. In addition, Moonblast is able to cleanly 2HKO Unaware Quagsire, essentially preventing it from outstalling Clefable. 

Usage Tips
========
This set is fairly straightforward and easy to use: have Clefable come in on a weak wall, such as Rotom-W, Mandibuzz, or Chansey, and from there, Clefable can set up Calm mind against these such threats with no concern. It's a good, however, to dispose of Whirlwind / Roar users and remove Heatran before attempting to do this, as all these threats can annoyingly keep Clefable in line for the time being. As far as teams to use this Clefable on, it best fits on bulky offense teams in need of a stallbreaker. Do keep in mind that this Clefable's sole purpose is to take out stall, so it's best not to force it to take on the role of a wall itself, so be weary if you attempt to switch it into more powerful physical attackers such as Garchomp and Terrakion.

Team Options
========
- It generally appreciates support from Pokemon that can smash through the likes of Mega Venusaur, so powerful psychic-types such as Latias can deal with these threats with ease.
- In return, Clefable can help deal with opposing Dark- and Dragon-types that trouble it.
- Other offensive partners that can work are Alakazam and Tornadus-t for similar reasons to the above.
- More applicable defensive partners are Chansey and Blissey as they can function as reliable special walls while clefable takes on more physical oriented threats.
- Skarmory is one of the better physical walls to pair it with, as it can check pesky Steel-types rather well.
- Hippowdon can also be an effective partner for the above reason.
- Magnezone is also a preferred partner to take out the likes of of Bisharp, Mega Mawile, and various other Steel-types.


Other Options
########

The most stand-out option excluded from the analysis is a Cosmic Power set. Cosmic Power Clefable becomes incredibly difficult to take down just after a few boosts. Furthermore, Clefable can take advantage of these plentiful stat boosts via Stored Power. The Cosmic Power set can also utilize either Magic Guard or Unaware alongside Moonblast and/or Stored Power with a selection of the following moves: Soft-Boiled + Flamethrower for Magic Guard variants; Wish + Protect or Moonlight + Flamethrower for Unaware variants. While the Cosmic Power set has many different approaches, the issue with it is that there will always be a gaping flaw that prevents such a set from working too consistently. If Clefable does not use Magic Guard, it will find itself utterly ruined by Toxic, and if Clefable forgoes Unaware, the set becomes far too passive, so much so that other boosting sweepers can set up alongside it. Indeed, the Cosmic Power set has the potential to win games, but its hit-or-miss type of performance ultimately prevents it from being included within the other standard sets.

Clefable has a slew of other supportive and disruptive tactics including Encore, Healing Wish, Trick + Flame Orb, Magic Coat, and Counter. Encore can work effectively with Magic Guard variants by halting boosting sweepers; Encore can also be useful to lock slower entry hazard setters into one move; however, Clefable should best stick to Unaware if it wants to combat boosting sweepers, and outside of the previously mentioned applications, Encore has otherwise limited use. Healing Wish can be game-changing move on more offensively based teams by restoring the health of an injured sweeper, although sacrificing Clefable is generally imprudent given its vital role as a team player. Trick + Flame Orb in tandem with Magic Guard is a great way to cripple many of Clefable's common switch-ins such as Bisharp, Excadrill, and Scizor among others. Another way Clefable can becomes even more of annoyance is with Magic Coat, as it can deflect entry hazards from the Deoxys formes and give faster Taunt users a taste of their own medicine. Counter can also find use by getting a surprise KO on physical attackers that want to try their luck with Clefable, but this option is an immediate giveaway and subsequent waste if used carelessly.

In regards to more offensive options, Clefable has no shortage of offensive moves that include Focus Blast, Hidden Power Ground, Charge Beam, Ice Beam, Seismic Toss, and Knock Off. Focus Blast can be used over Flamethrower on the Calm Mind sets to break past Heatran, but its low PP and unappealing accuracy might be a turnoff. Likewise, Hidden Power Ground is another way to eradicate Heatran, but it's rather weak against every other Steel-type, even after boost. Charge Beam may also be used to simultaneously attack and potentially bestow Clefable with a Special Attack boost, but just like Hidden Power Ground, it is laughably weak. Ice Beam can work effectively by destroying Gliscor and Landorus-T, but it has limited use outside of that. Seismic Toss can be used on the defensive sets for a consistent damaging move. Lastly, Knock Off's disruptive shenanigans can work well in crippling many of Clefable's opponents, but again, it is quite weak.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Taunt users**: The best way to beat Clefable is through the use of faster and bulky Taunt users. Mew, Gliscor, and Deoxys-D can easily come in on just about every one of Clefable's attacks, prevent it from boosting or recovering via Taunt, recover off any damage they might have attained over the course of this ordeal, and wear Clefable down with their own attacks. The only thing that stops them is an incoming Toxic on the switch, or in the case of Gliscor, a boosted Moonblast.

**Steel-types**: Just about every Steel-type can check Clefable fairly well by virtue of their ability to outright OHKO it with their STABs. These Pokemon include Aegislash, Bisharp, Mega Mawile, Mega Aggron, Jirachi, Scizor, Excadrill, and Heatran. Although it is precautionary that these all of the Pokemon (with the exception of Heatran) avoid directly switching in on Clefable, as it frequently carries a Fire-type move that can eradicate them, and in the case of Heatran, it can simply be overpowered by Calm Mind variants one-on-one or be worn down by repeated Thunderbolts.

**Poison-types**: One of the more notable checks to Clefable is Mega Venusaur, as it can switch into all of Clefable's standard attacks and 2HKO with Sludge Bomb; however, similar to Heatran, Clefable can muscle through it with the Calm Mind set. Other effective Poison-types are Amoonguss, Gengar, Roserade, and Tentacruel. Amoonguss only has to watch out for a Life Orb-boosted Fire Blast, otherwise it's a solid check to Clefable for similar reasons to Venusaur, but in contrast, it does not lose to the Calm Mind sets because of its access to Clear smog. In the case of Gengar and Roserade, neither of them enjoy switching in on a Fire-type move, but should they get in safely, they can easily destroy Clefable with Sludge Bomb. In contrast to the previous two, Tentacruel can switch into most of Clefable's attacks and overwhelm it with repeated Sludge Bombs, though it does have to watch out for Thunderbolt. So long as it steers clear of Thunderbolt, Crobat can easily beat Clefable one-versus-one with Taunt + Roost.
