<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder will not receive any damage from Ground-type moves. The wielder will also not be affected by <a href="/bw/moves/spikes">Spikes</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/toxic_spikes">Toxic Spikes</a>, and can switch out of a Pokemon with <a href="/bw/abilities/arena_trap">Arena Trap</a>. It also receives no damage from the move <a href="/bw/moves/sky_drop">Sky Drop</a>. These immunities are lost while under the effects of <a href="/bw/moves/gravity">Gravity</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/ingrain">Ingrain</a>, or while holding an <a href="/bw/items/iron_ball">Iron Ball</a>. <a href="/bw/moves/roost">Roost</a> does not take away the effects of Levitate.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Levitate is one of the most useful abilities in the game because it gives full immunity to Ground-type moves, some of the most common attacks in the game, and to Spikes, allowing a Pokemon with Levitate to laugh in the face of almost all entry hazards. There are a number of notable Pokemon that benefit from this ability, as otherwise they would have a weakness to Ground-type attacks, such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/gengar">Gengar</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/rotom-w">Rotom-W</a>. Levitate is a great ability on almost any Pokemon. The one exception to this rule is <a href="/bw/pokemon/rotom-s">Rotom-S</a>.</p>
