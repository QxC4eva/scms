<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Dragon-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed during the damage calculation. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Dragon-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Haban Berry is often not seen in the OU tier, but in Ubers it can be used to some extent. On Pokemon such as Garchomp or Rayquaza, who easily find time to come in and set up, only to get forced out by Choice Scarf Palkia, really like this item. With Haban Berry, Garchomp or Rayquaza can take the STAB super effective Spacial Rend and then hit back with their own Dragon-type attack.</p>

<p>This item does come with downsides, of course. When equipped with Haban Berry, the Pokemon's damage output will be cut dramatically due to the absence of Expert Belt or Life Orb. You may survive a Dragon-type attack, but your ability to sweep will be greatly reduced.</p>
