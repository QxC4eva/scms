[SHORT DESC]
Heals 50% of user's max HP.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals the user by 1/2 of its maximum HP, rounded half up. It has an in-game effect which allows you to heal the other members of your party. The user loses 20% of its maximum HP, and the target party member gains that much HP. It fails if the user is below 20% HP or the target is at full health.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Softboiled is known as the signature move of two of the best stallers in the game: Blissey and Chansey. Unfortunately, it faces stiff competition with Wish, a move that can heal the rest of these two Pokemon's team as well. It does, however, have the nice use of instant, reliable recovery. Also notable in the lower tiers is Clefable, who possesses Magic Guard; it too has access to the often more useful Wish. Perhaps if Softboiled was more widespread, it would see more use, as it is by no means a bad move.</p>
