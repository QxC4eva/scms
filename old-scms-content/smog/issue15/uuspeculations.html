<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Black and White OU metagame has been a fluctual one to say the least. There are bigger and badder threats, new moves and items, more abilities, and a constantly changing metagame. With all of this chaos, some veteran Pokemon seem to have been left behind wondering where they belong. Thanks to the recent server crash and the combined efforts of community members, particularly chaos, Rising_Dusk, Super, DougJustDoug, Philip7086, and EeveeTrainer, Smogon's Pokemon Online server moved to Rising_Dusk's computer and then back to chaos's brand spanking new computer, and with that the possibility of finally seeing some usage stats. Soon, we will be able to see where every Pokemon truly lies in this ever-changing metagame. In the meantime, here are some Pokemon we've speculated will have dropped out of OU for good and that will likely be the top contenders of the new UU.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: This article was written before UU was even opened, so even the title is a little misleading (UU has been released for almost two months now).  We realize that a lot of this article is outdated at the time of its release and we apologize.  Still, it's a fun article to read if you were around during the time people were speculating what UU would turn out to be.  Enjoy.</p>

<h2>The Big Brutes</h2>

<p>Every metagame has its heavy hitters, and the new UU will surely have its fair share of them. While the Attack and Special Attack stats may not reach the same astronomical levels of BW OU, they will probably get pretty close, and here are some of the Pokemon that may fill the role of the Big Brute on the block.</p>

<h3>Snorlax</h3>

<p>Yep, it seems like the big guy's days in OU are gone for good. While he may never reclaim his glory of being the most threatening Pokemon around, he may find a new throne to take in UU. His stats are still monstrous, and with the absence of the extremely hard hitters of OU, particularly Conkeldurr, Excadrill, and Lucario, Snorlax may very well take the UU metagame by storm.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="/media/smog/15/uuspeculations_snorlax.png" alt="" /></div>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/143.png" alt="Snorlax" /><br />
Snorlax @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Thick Fat<br />
EVs: 188 HP / 104 Def / 216 SpD<br />
Careful Nature (+SpD, -SpA)<br />
- Curse<br />
- Body Slam / Return<br />
- Earthquake / Crunch / Fire Punch<br />
- Rest</p>

<p>Curselax returns, and with a vengeance. With UU shaping up to be a toned down version of DPP OU, Snorlax may very well roll right over his competition like he did in GSC. The basic idea will be a familiar one: wait until all Fighting-types have been eliminated, come in, Curse up, Rest when needed, and proceed to demolish everything that stands in your way. While Snorlax is miffed that his STAB Selfdestruct has been nerfed, he may not need it anymore since there probably won't be any Pokemon that can severely threaten him. It will be interesting to see if Snorlax will become the ultimate "last Pokemon standing" that he was back in the glory days.</p>

<h3>Mamoswine</h3>

<p>Mamoswine was always considered the "Ice-type that could." As one of only two Pokemon that was the Ice-type in DPP OU, Mamoswine had quite the reputation to uphold coming into the fifth generation. Unfortunately, he seems to have disappeared almost altogether. His niche as the "Dragon-type slayer" has been upended, and his previously questionable bulk has proven to be too frail for the hard-hitting BW metagame. Fortunately, he's as powerful as he ever was, and as the wielder of one of the strongest STAB Earthquakes and Ice Shards around, he's sure to fit right in UU.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/478.png" alt="Mamoswine" /><br />
Mamoswine @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Snow Cloak<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Ice Shard<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Superpower</p>

<p>A Choice Band-boosted STAB Earthquake coming off a base 130 Attack stat is going to hurt everything it touches in the new UU. While the metagame around him will probably still be faster than he is, Mamoswine's STAB Ice Shard should easily remedy this shortcoming. Stone Edge and Superpower round off the set, with the former combining with Earthquake to form the infamous "QuakeEdge" combo, providing almost perfect neutral coverage. While his many weaknesses, lack of resistances, and relative fragility will still be hurdles to overcome, you would be foolish to not be prepared to take on this angry mammoth. It's a whole new generation, and Mamoswine is hoping for the best.</p>

<h3>Celebi</h3>

<p>Not a big brute you say? Well, say that to this harmless-looking green pixie's face and see what happens. Celebi's back and raring to rip up the new UU. So why isn't our wood nymph still in OU you ask? Unfortunately for Celebi, her seven weaknesses have finally caught up with her, and, while they are solid, base 100 stats aren't as awesome as they used to be. Celebi is still one of the most versatile Pokemon around, and with an almost unending movepool at her disposal, good luck finding a hard counter to her this time around.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/251.png" alt="Celebi" /><br />
Celebi @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Energy Ball / Grass Knot<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Earth Power / Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>With no ScarfTar to rain (well, sandstorm) on her parade and fewer Steel- and Dragon-type threats in general, Celebi is sure to use her new-found offensive set to its fullest potential. While Celebi was generally used as a defensive Pokemon in DPP OU, the void for role of strong special attacker is up for grabs in BW UU, and Celebi definitely stands out as one of the harder hitters available. The moves are pretty self-explanatory: Nasty Plot forms the crux of the set, and sends Celebi's already decent Special Attack through the roof. The choice between Energy Ball and Grass Knot is a tough one. Energy Ball offers consistent damage, and may work better in the new UU, where last generation it was overall a pretty "light" metagame. However, almost all of the Pokemon I'm going to talk about in this article are pretty heavy-set, and Grass Knot may in fact be the better option. Psychic is there for a nice, reliable STAB move. The final slot is the Steel-type blaster of choice. Earth Power hits grounded Steels harder than Hidden Power Fire, particularly Registeel, as well as Fire-types; however, Hidden Power Fire also offers coverage against opposing Celebi and other Grass-types, as well as floating Steels.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Specially Defensive Behemoths</h2>

<p>With the new UU shaping up to be a milder version of DPP OU, the time for Pokemon with huge defensive stats and weak offenses may have finally arrived. While stall has always been an effective strategy with key players like Skarmory and Blissey available, other defensive Pokemon were left out due to their less-than-stellar typing or non-existant offensive stats. Fortunately for them though, there will probably be less big offensive threats to challenge them in the new UU, and some new defensive Behemoths may take a hold and make this new metagame their home.</p>

<h3>Deoxys-D</h3>

<p>Uber you say? Doubt it. Deoxys-D was always a bit of an anomaly in the DPP Uber realm. It was originally banished because its name had "Deoxys" in it, and the reason for it never having been dropped down with Deoxys-S is still not fully understood (though, it's probably because its huge defenses and nice Speed, combined with Calm Mind, Recover, Spikes, and OK offensive stats seemed a little intimidating). The story rings a little different in BW for Deoxys-D, and probably for the better. While it has a tiny bit of "Cresselia syndrome" (which I'll get to in the next Pokemon) to keep it out of OU, especially considering threats like Tyranitar and Reuniclus, its 50/160/160 defenses will be almost unmatched in the new UU, already giving it a bit of a niche. However, its (by wall standards) huge base 90 Speed stat is what will really make Deoxys-D a top contender in the new UU. Definitely take this star-fallen DNA monster into consideration when building your new team, lest you succumb to its mysterious wrath.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/388.png" alt="Deoxys-D" /><br />
Deoxys-D @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA<br />
Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Psychic / Psyshock<br />
- Recover<br />
- Thunderbolt / Ice Beam / Focus Blast</p>

<p>A standard, yet deadly, Calm Mind set. Reuniclus has already proven how effective a simple Calm Mind set can be in OU, and while Deoxys-D doesn't have the same tools or offensive stat to work with, its higher defenses will let it accumulate more boosts, and still probably put the hurt on a large number of UU Pokemon. Snorlax may be a bit troublesome for Deoxys-D to overcome, and Deoxys-D will still definitely not enjoy Pursuit and U-turn, or Dark-, Ghost-, and Bug-type attacks from any Pokemon in general, but without the big players to put Deoxys out of commission, it may just give UU a run for its money. The set is easy to use. Come in on a weaker attacker, like a bulky Water-type, alternate between Calm Mind and Recover until you can't Calm Mind anymore, and blast the opponent with the appropriate attack. The choice between Psychic and Psyshock is a tough one and will probably be left to the player's preference. Psyshock may prove better though thanks to its ability to nail Snorlax in his weaker Defense stat, and the ability to beat opposing Calm Mind users one-on-one. The coverage move of choice is also a tough call. Thunderbolt blasts bulky Water-types, Ice Beam destroys any Grass-types, and Focus Blast eliminates any Steel-types, with the latter choice being the most appealing (though the accuracy is a real kick to the cojones).</p>

<h3>Cresselia</h3>

<p>With stunning 120/120/130 base defenses, a good base 85 Speed, and the rare ability to counter Dragon-types effectively, you're probably wondering where Cresselia went wrong. The answer lies in her typing and movepool. Psychic typing is terrible defensively, being weak to both Pursuit and U-turn, and not good offensively, with Dark being immune to it and Steel being resistant. What does this mean? Some of the most common Pokemon (this generation and last generation) such as Scizor, Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, Jellicent, Heatran, and Metagross walk all over her. Plus, Cresselia's only form of healing (outside of Rest) is Moonlight, the effectiveness of which is halved in rain, hail, or sandstorm (it is boosted by the sun). Still, Cresselia is one of the best Dragon-type counters this side of moon (which probably can't be stressed enough) and the pink duck is a dangerous Calm Mind sweeper and awesome supporter in her own right. Will she cause havoc in UU like she did in last generation and be banned once again?</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/493.png" alt="Cresselia" /><br />
Cresselia @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Reflect / Light Screen<br />
- Moonlight / Rest<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Thunder Wave / Psychic</p>

<p>The standard OU support set from last generation returns. Reflect and Light Screen buff Cresselia's appropriate defense practically through the roof, and also support Cresselia's team. Luckily for her, like last generation, weather will probably not be very prominent in the UU metagame, letting her enjoy 50% recovery from Moonlight most of the time. However, if the presence of Abomasnow and Hippopotas (or Hippowdon) proves to be too much, Rest may have to be Cresselia's only way of healing once again. That's not too bad though, considering any Pokemon will be hard-pressed to 2HKO her anyway, especially when she's behind the right screen. Ice Beam is the attack of choice for one reason: Dragon-types. Cresselia remains as one of the best Dragon-type counters available, and while most will be presiding in OU this round, Flygon, Altaria, Druddigon, and maybe even Haxorus will be reigning in the UU tier, making Ice Beam as viable a choice as any. The last slot is left for either Thunder Wave, for further team support, or Psychic, for STAB and more coverage.</p> 

<h3>Suicune</h3>

<p>Ferrothorn be damned! My thoughts exactly Suicune. That nasty, thorny monstrosity had an enormous effect on the OU tier, and one of the main consequences of its existence was the drop-off in usage of the once dominant "bulky Water." While Tentacruel and Vaporeon can still hold their own in OU (the former due to its typing and ability, and the latter due to its Wish passing skills), Suicune has, unfortunately, been left behind. Don't get me wrong, it's still bulkier than all get out (100/115/115 defenses are nothing to sneeze at) and Water is a great defensive typing in the absence of Ferrothorn, as demonstrated last generation. So, Suicune may indeed reign supreme in the new UU as the "new Milotic," or hopefully, even better.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/245.png" alt="Suicune" /><br />
Suicune @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk<br />
- Surf<br />
- Calm Mind</p>

<p>CroCune returns to command the UU tier. The strategy is as simple as Curselax's; come in on something that can't possibly harm you, Calm Mind, Rest when needed and Sleep Talk while doing so, and drown your opponent with Surf to your heart's content. Surf is the sole attack, as it gains STAB and no Pokemon, short of Dry Skin or Water Absorb users, are immune to it. Thanks to Pressure, CroCune can easily outstall most other defensive Pokemon like the Psychic-types listed above, and CroCune isn't even stopped by Toxic or Toxic Spikes. So what can you possibly do to stop such a beast? The short end of it, not much. It's obviously helpless against Water Absorb or Dry Skin Pokemon, so if you have one of those still alive on your team, you're safe. But if not, your best bet is to switch in a physical attacking Pokemon that resists Surf to set up on it and destroy it in return. Dragon Dance Altaria is a prime candidate, as well as Swords Dance Tangrowth. Phazing it out with Roar or Whilrwind is also a viable strategy, though only if CroCune isn't the last Pokemon on the opponent's team. The moral of the story? Don't let CroCune set up. Because if you do, it'll be game over incredibly fast.</p>

<h2>The Odd Ones Out</h2>

<p>These Pokemon come as rather surprises. Surprising because they were either used a lot last generation, seem too powerful or important to have not been used enough for OU this time, and simply because they were really forgotten up until now. All threats and unique in their own right, just not special enough to be OU (for the time being anyway).</p>

<h3>Abomasnow</h3>

<p>The Christmas yeti returns to UU, and with it, its auto-weather hail. Last generation, [O]bomasnow was banned from UU due to making Froslass, Walrein, and various other Ice-types too powerful for the metagame, and for being a decent Pokemon in its own right. However, it never became an OU staple because of its seven weaknesses, few resistances, and subpar overall stats. The same holds true in BW, and while weather is arguably more important now than ever, hail is still the least common (and arguably worst) weather in OU. Fortunately, the future does look bright for Abomasnow in UU. Without Tyranitar, Politoed, Ninetales, and maybe Hippowdon to ruin Abomasnow's hail, it may single-handedly command the weather scene and enlist Froslass and Walrein to its ranks once again. Unfortunately, Hippopotas will still exist to get rid of the hail, and Abomasnow's seven weaknesses and entry hazard vulnerability may be too much for the pudgy tree.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/465.png" alt="Abomasnow" /><br />
Abomasnow @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Snow Warning<br />
EVs: 164 Atk / 116 SpA / 228 Spe<br />
Hasty Nature (+Spe, -Def)<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Wood Hammer<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>Putting Abomasnow's best stats to good use, a mixed attacker Choice Scarf set brings surprise value, hail, and power all in one hairy tree. Abomasnow is traditionally used as a lead to bring the hail early in the game and foil any Focus Sash users. While Abomasnow doesn't have the raw power of a lot of other Pokemon, it does have very high-powered STABs that make up for it. Blizzard, which is 100% accurate because of the hail, and Wood Hammer are the STAB moves of choice. The last two moves are for any Steel-types cocky enough to stand up to Abomasnow. Hidden Power Fire hits any floating Steels and Escavalier, while Earthquake puts the hurt on Fire-types and any grounded Steels.</p>

<h3>Mew</h3>

<p>Another Uber? Blasphemy! Well, believe it or not, Mew has fallen out of favor enough to drop into UU, for the time being anyway (the Taunt + Will-O-Wisp set is gaining rapidly in popularity). So why the initial fall? Probably because, like many of the others listed above, its typing isn't great. And while Mew is one the most unpredictable Pokemon ever conceived, and one of the best Baton Passers, base 100 stats aren't fantastic anymore. Still, Mew will be a force to be reckoned with in new UU.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="/media/smog/15/uuspeculations_mew.png" alt="" /></div>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/151.png" alt="Mew" /><br />
Mew @ Leftovers / Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Synchronize<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Baton Pass<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Substitute / Taunt</p>

<p>Mew is still one of the best Baton Passers available, and in an environment where a Nasty Plot-boosted base 100 Special Attack stat is scary, Mew is sure to cause a lot of trouble in UU. The main idea will be to switch into a specially defensive frail Pokemon, Nasty Plot to scare them out, and then Baton Pass to the appropriate teammate (if Mew can't outright blast them with Psychic). Psychic is for STAB and ensures that Mew isn't rendered totally useless by Taunt. The last slot is a doozy to choose between. Substitute blocks any status attacks aimed at Mew, and it provides a buffer to Mew's teammates to ensure they aren't hurt on the pass switch in. However, Taunt blocks status as well, and it also stops the opponent from phazing Mew or its teammates out, at the cost of leaving Mew open to attack. Because the main goal of the set is to pass a Nasty Plot to a teammate, the EV spread is designed to make Mew decently bulky and give it as much Speed as possible. If you want to make Mew a more aggressive Nasty Plotter that can Baton Pass out if the going gets rough, you can make the last moveslot Thunderbolt or Flamethrower, and move the HP EVs to Special Attack.</p>

<h3>Flygon</h3>

<p>Poor Flygon. With the introduction of Hydreigon and Haxorus, Flygon is simply too weak a Dragon-type to be considered for competitive play. He's still fast and has a great typing, but his niche is simply not good enough for the OU tier. There's hope for him in the new UU though. As the fastest Dragon available in UU, (the alternatives being Druddigon and Altaria) ScarfGon may indeed dominate the switching and scouting game like he did last generation. A base 100 Attack stat isn't bad either, especially considering Dragon + Ground offers almost complete neutral coverage in UU. Has Flygon finally found a realm where he's the most bad-ass Dragon around?</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/330.png" alt="Flygon" /><br />
Flygon @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Stone Edge / Fire Blast</p>

<p>ScarfGon returns for another round of Scarf U-turn charades and trickery. Outrage provides Flygon with a powerful, almost unresisted attack to run straight through the UU metagame. Earthquake blasts any grounded Steel-types that stand in his way. The last slot is solely for coverage. Stone Edge hits any Flying-types cocky enough to think they can switch in on a Choiced Earthquake for free. Fire Blast was traditionally for Skarmory, Forretress, and now Ferrothorn, but with all three being OU, Flygon may not have a need for it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The OU tier is constantly changing. And as time goes on, new strategies and new threats will emerge. As that happens, new Pokemon will fall in and out of OU, thereby constantly changing UU. What was said here was merely speculation and only a small nibble of how massive the UU metagame will be. Maybe I'm completely wrong as to how some of these Pokemon may be played. Some of these Pokemon may stay in UU, some may move up to OU, some may be deemed too powerful and banished to BL, and still others may drop even further to RU. Who knows? All I know, is that UU will be a fun ride, and I hope you're as excited to experience it as I am. Let the crazy fun begin!</p>
