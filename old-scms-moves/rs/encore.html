[SHORT DESC]
Causes the target to repeat the move 4-8 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Causes the target to repeat the move it last used for 4-8 turns. In 2v2, targeted moves target a random foe. If the target runs out of PP while Encored, the Encore will end regardless of how many turns it has been running for. If the target cannot use the Encored move, it will be forced to use Struggle. If a Pokemon which is switched in via Baton Pass also knows Baton Pass, it will be forced to select Baton Pass as its next attack if it is targeted by Encore before using another move.

<p>Encore will fail if the target has not selected a move since switching in, or if the target tried and failed to use a move this turn (due to Sleep, Paralysis, recharging, etc) before being targeted with Encore.</p>
