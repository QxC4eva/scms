Overview
########
Rotom-H has usually been regarded as being a lesser Rotom-W. Possessing a weakness to Stealth Rock and a worse STAB combination, it's not hard to see why this has been so. In addition, as a Fire-type, Rotom-H faces immense competition from Heatran as well, who boasts a much better defensive typing and offers far more flexibility. However, Rotom-H does have its merits. It possesses eight resistances and one immunity, compared to Rotom-W's six. Certain threats alike are handled much better by Rotom-H than by Rotom-W, including Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus, Aegislash, Ferrothorn, and Celebi. In comparison to Heatran, Rotom-H gains an immunity to the Ground-type moves that destroy Heatran, and handles Water-types much better than Heatran does. It's important to keep in mind these valuable niches, or else you're better off running a more viable Pokemon in Rotom-H's place.


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Thunderbolt
move 4: Trick / Thunderbolt
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Unfortunately, the inconsistent Overheat is Rotom-H's only Fire-type STAB, and cannot be replaced. However, it is far stronger than any of Rotom-H's other attacks, boosting its viability greatly, and meshes well with this Rotom-H's hit-and-run nature. Volt Switch is functionally Rotom-H's most important move, as it allows Rotom-H to safely scout the opponent's team and quickly get Rotom-H out of a bad situation. Hidden Power Ice gives Rotom-H the power to revenge kill popular offensive Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus, even outspeeding +1 Dragonite thanks to the Choice Scarf. However, its low power means the aforementioned threats will need to have taken some prior damage for a clean OHKO. Thunderbolt, on the other hand, dishes out a much stronger hit to foes like Jellicent or Togekiss, as they can simply recover the damage taken from Volt Switch. In addition, it lets Rotom-H stay in battle with a STAB attack, which Volt Switch and Overheat do not allow for. Finally, Trick lets Rotom-H permanently cripple the walls that aim to stop it, namely Blissey, Chansey, and Goodra.

Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Special Attack and Speed, the two most important stats for this set's success. A Timid nature lets Rotom-H speed tie with +1 Rotom-W and outspeed +1 Jolly Dragonite and +1 Adamant Excadrill. A slightly bulkier spread of 108 HP / 176 SpA / 224 Spe with a Timid nature lets Rotom-H survive Choice Band Azumarill's Aqua Jet from full health, and outspeeds +1 Mega Gyarados, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Aerodactyl. If more power is desired, a Modest nature guarantees a OHKO on Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock, but keep in mind this prevents Rotom-H from outspeeding all of the aforementioned threats, so it generally isn't worth it.

Usage Tips
========

Rotom-H can be brought out against Pokemon it walls, such as Talonflame, taking minimal damage and immediately threatening them. This Rotom-H also functions as a great revenge killer, threatening many popular offensive Pokemon with one of its STABs or coverage moves after a teammate faints. In addition, Rotom-H functions as an excellent lead, using Volt Switch to gain early momentum. Overheat is usually a powerful move to spam should Volt Switch be a poor choice; however, one must be extremely wary of being locked into Overheat against Heatran or setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Keldeo or Dragon Dance Dragonite.

Team Options
========

Due to this Rotom-H's hit-and-run nature, Rapid Spin or Defog support is crucial to prevent Rotom-H from being worn down. Good Rapid Spin or Defog users to pair with Rotom-H include Empoleon, Latias, Mega Blastoise, Starmie, Tentacruel, and bulky variants of Scizor, as all share decent synergy with Rotom-H. Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn can easily form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-H, as it matches well with common users of the strategy such as Landorus and Scizor. Finally, teammates that attract Ground-type moves or threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame are great for Rotom-H, as smart plays will let Rotom-H easily grab momentum with Volt Switch or fire off powerful Overheats.


Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Volt Switch / Thunderbolt
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Thunderbolt
move 4: Trick / Thunderbolt
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Specs
nature: Timid
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Once again, Overheat is Rotom-H's only Fire-type STAB. However, Choice Specs makes it incredibly powerful, OHKOing or 2HKOing most anything that doesn't resist it. Volt Switch grabs momentum for the team, but the more powerful and consistent Thunderbolt is better suited for the punch offered by Choice Specs, allowing it to replace any move apart from Overheat. Hidden Power Ice hits common switch-ins extremely hard, netting guaranteed OHKOs on Garchomp, Landorus, Gliscor, and Dragonite (if Multiscale is broken). Trick again allows Rotom-H to cripple Blissey, Chansey, and Goodra, all of whom can stomach Rotom-H's attacks, even with Choice Specs.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Special Attack, allowing Rotom-H to hit as hard as possible. However, a Timid nature is suggested because it allows Rotom-H to take advantage of its Speed tier, outspeeding all unboosted Gyarados, Dragonite, Heatran, and Mega Scizor. However, an alternate spread of 80 HP / 252 SpA / 176 Spe with a Modest nature gives Rotom-H more power and more bulk, while providing it enough Speed to outspeed maximum speed Scizor. Although this is a Choice Specs set, an Expert Belt can be used instead, since it is much easier to bluff a Specs boost than a Scarf boost. Although this lessens Rotom-H's power significantly, Rotom-H has the appropriate coverage to hit many unsuspecting foes for major damage.

Usage Tips
========

Choice Specs Rotom-H is a great hole-puncher, and unlike much of its competition, like Darmanitan or Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-H has the bulk and typing to switch in at many points of a battle to dish out damage. It's advisable to send out Rotom-H against foes such as Talonflame and Celebi to avoid taking much damage; however, considering not only that all of these Pokemon carry U-turn but also that this Rotom-H lacks the speed of the Scarf set to Volt Switch out of bad situations quickly, prediction skills should be utilized to catch these Pokemon on the switch.

Team Options
========

As with the Choice Scarf set, Rotom-H will be worn down quickly by repeated Stealth Rock damage. Thus, a good Defogger or spinner is necessary to offset this weakness. This Rotom-H should be primarily used on offensive teams looking to severely weaken the opponent's team before a sweep. Make sure this Rotom-H variant is not the only reliable all-around attacker on a team, as it lacks the speed and consistency to pull off a late game sweep of its own. Good teammates include Dragonite, Mega Charizard X, Thundurus, and Landorus, all of whom can easily sweep teams after they have been weakened, and carry the coverage, speed, and power necessary to function as a singular sweeper.


Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Pain Split / Rest
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers / Chesto Berry
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD

Moves
========

Despite this Rotom-H's defensive nature, Overheat remains in place to threaten most of the Pokemon it counters. Volt Switch again provides momentum utility; with this Rotom-H's greatly increased longevity, more opportunities to use Volt Switch will arise. Will-O-Wisp cripples many of the attackers that may try to switch into Rotom-H, namely Garchomp and Dragonite. Finally, Pain Split is one of two choices Rotom-H has for recovery, putting it to decent use with a low HP stat of 50. However, Rest provides a much more thorough form of recovery than Pain Split, particularly in removing the effects of Toxic, at the cost of practically forcing Rotom-H to carry Chesto Berry (and therefore only working reliably one time). However, it is possible to run a second status move in place of the recovery slot. Thunder Wave is better for offensive teams looking to outspeed many of Rotom-H's faster switch-ins, whereas Toxic deals with Rotom-W much more efficiently than Will-O-Wisp does, and has better synergy with defensive teams.

Set Details
========

A specially defensive EV spread and nature lets Rotom-H switch into many common special attackers, such as Celebi or Clefable, many of which Rotom-H already walls due to its great defensive typing. However, a physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature is equally viable, allowing Rotom-H to take on physical attackers like Talonflame better. Leftovers gives Rotom-H a reliable long-term mode of recovery, healing the chip damage that may be incurred from switching into something it walls, or partially making up for the presence of Stealth Rock. However, if Rest is being used, Chesto Berry is the best option, essentially giving it a second chance at life.

Usage Tips
========

With a defensive build, Rotom-H can very easily come in on attackers, especially against ones that are already at a severe type disadvantage. Unlike many defensive Pokemon, it can force most of them out, threatening with one of its STABs or a status move. Because of this, it's essential to have Stealth Rock up on the opponent's side, as many of the Pokemon Rotom-H counters, such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, will be taking massive damage from it. The durability of this Rotom-H makes it very easy for attackers to incur hazard damage over the course of a match. Furthermore, prediction against incoming switch-ins is key with this Rotom-H: a timely burn or a smart Volt Switch can easily turn the tide of a battle in your favor. This Rotom-H excels at playing mind games with the opponent, as its wide range of functions and increased utility make it a very relevant defensive threat to many attackers.

Team Options
========

Like with the other sets, Rapid Spin or Defog support is crucial, as Rotom-H cannot perform its defensive duties well if it is taking 25% damage each time it switches in. Powerful, hole-punching Pokemon or setup sweepers love this Rotom-H build because it is great at reliably gaining momentum throughout the course of a match. In addition, defensive Pokemon and setup sweepers alike will appreciate the reduced damage output from a burnt opponent. However, if being used on a defensive team, teammates must be able to handle powerful physical Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, as they cannot be burnt. In addition, teammates must be able to handle Garchomp, as variants with Substitute are able to freely setup against Rotom-H without fear of Will-O-Wisp.


Other Options
########

If Gastrodon, Quagsire, or Swampert is a major concern, Hidden Power Grass can be used over Hidden Power Ice, seeing as Rotom-H is such a great lure for these Pokemon. However, this is not recommended because it leaves Rotom-H extremely vulnerable to many Dragon-types, which are arguably more common and more important for Rotom-H to target. Hex is another option Rotom-H possesses, becoming a 130 Base Power move when the opponent is afflicted with a status condition. Although Rotom-H typically has no trouble inflicting status, its low speed and lack of STAB discourage the use of Hex, along with the fact that Rotom-H is hard-pressed enough to run more than one status move, let alone another attack. Similarly to Hex, Electro Ball has the potential to work in tandem with paralysis. However, Rotom-H is still held back from its aforementioned faults, along with the fact that two of Rotom-H's most popular switch-ins, Rotom-W and Garchomp, are totally immune. Rotom-H can utilize Sunny Day with Heat Rock to be a reliable, bulky sun setter and abuser that resists and gets STAB on Fire-type moves, is immune to Ground-type moves, and has STAB coverage against Water-types, a combination of traits unexhibited in other sun setters. Rotom-H can also utilize dual screens and a slow Volt Switch to aid its teammates in setting up. Electroweb is a unique option that lets a full invested Rotom-H outspeed anything under fully invested 150 base Speed. However, it is an extremely weak move, and Rotom-H would usually rather switch out with Volt Switch. However, Electroweb can be good for forcing switches, especially if entry hazards are up. Finally, Rotom-H can use Assault Vest to become an even more effective special tank. However, a complete lack of recovery coupled with a Stealth Rock weakness is extremely bad for a defensive Pokemon, and the support required to keep Rotom-H alive may not be worth it.


Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: Rotom-H can barely touch most special walls, with Toxic being the only somewhat viable option on the defensive set to combat them. However, offensive sets are still hopelessly walled by the likes of Goodra, Blissey, or Chansey, their best option being Trick (which, in the end, does not prevent them from continuing to be walled.)

**Speedier Offensive Pokemon**: Non-scarf variants of Rotom-H must watch out for many of the faster offensive Pokemon that have the typing or coverage to rip Rotom-H apart. Nearly anything that Rotom-H doesn't obviously wall will carry something that can hurt it.

**Mold Breaker**: Mold Breaker Earthquakes from the likes of Excadrill will absolutely shred Rotom-H, blazing past Levitate. It is extremely important that you look for the telltale "________ breaks the mold!" warning when a possible user is sent out.

**Bulky Setup Sweepers**: Bulky setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Volcarona will take a pittance from any of Rotom-H's attacks, and cannot be worn down without the aid of Toxic. Variants of Dragonite, Garchomp, and Zygarde carrying Substitute will be able to stave off every attack Rotom-H throws at them but Hidden Power Ice.
