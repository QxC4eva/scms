<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. If the target has already moved, this move's Base Power is doubled. Does not double if the target switched.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Payback is an incredible move for Pokemon with low base Speed, high base Attack stats, and good bulk. This is because the Base Power of Payback is doubled if the user goes after the target--traits required are exactly those listed above. Conkeldurr is a fine example of a Pokemon that utilizes Payback excellently. Since most of the sets it will be running are completely walled by Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon, Payback is a great move to take care of such Pokemon. Forretress is another notable mention, as it can utilize Payback to damage of spinblockers.</p>
