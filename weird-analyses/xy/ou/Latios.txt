Overview
########

Latios has always been a premier special attacker, something that has not changed with the advent of XY. While Latios struggles to beat some of the newly introduced Fairy-type Pokemon, it still has respectable Special Attack and Speed stats in addition to a wide movepool. Latios also makes for a good offensive user of Defog, allowing it to play more of a team support role, something it has never really been able to do in the past. While the introduction of Fairy-type Pokemon to the metagame has diminished Latios's capabilities as a sweeper, it is still a fearsome threat that should not be taken lightly.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Surf / Earthquake / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Roost / Defog
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Hasty

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is Latios's strongest and hence main STAB attack. Psyshock pairs well with Draco Meteor, getting STAB and good neutral coverage while doing physical damage, hurting special walls such as Blissey. The choice for the third move is entirely dependent on your team, as each coverage option allows Latios to beat a different threat. Surf lets Latios do super effective damage to Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon such as specially defensive Hippowdon and Tyranitar. Earthquake allows Latios to hit Pokemon such as Heatran, Bisharp, Aegislash, and Tyranitar, with the only real drawback being Latios having to use a Hasty nature. Hidden Power Fire can be used for Scizor and Genesect, both of which can threaten Latios with STAB Bug-type attacks. Roost allows Latios to heal itself, while Defog allows Latios to support its team better by removing entry hazards from the field.

Thunderbolt is also usable, hitting both Azumarill and Togekiss, two Fairy-type Pokemon that would otherwise be difficult to KO.

Set Details
========

The EVs focus on letting Latios deal as much damage as possible while maintaining its crucial Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed threats such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Infernape. A Life Orb is chosen for a similar reason, giving Latios as much damage output as possible without locking its move selections. However, Leftovers is a viable alternative if Defog is used, as Life Orb Latios with no healing lacks longevity.

Usage Tips
========

Latios works best as a hit-and-run attacker, largely due to the Special Attack drops from Draco Meteor. This also makes the best use out of Latios's fairly limited longevity, allowing it to be a relevant force throughout the match. When using Latios, it is important to be careful of using Draco Meteor too much, as many powerful threats can easily set up on a -2 Latios.

Team Options
========

The checks and counters to Latios vary greatly depending on its coverage moves; hence, its partners vary greatly as well. Nevertheless, a few Pokemon reliably check all sets, such as Sylveon and Aegislash. As a result, Pokemon such as Excadrill, Volcarona, and Zapdos make for good partners, being able to threaten both Sylveon and Aegislash. Latios pairs well with Pokemon that can lure special walls, making Aegislash and Keldeo good partners as well.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Surf / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Trick / Hidden Power Fire
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is the main attack of this set, as it is Latios's most powerful attack and gets STAB too. Psyshock works well in tandem with Draco Meteor, getting good coverage while hitting special walls hard. Surf not only allows Latios to beat common specially defensive Rock-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar but also gives it a reliable means of damaging Heatran. Hidden Power Fire, alternatively, can be used to beat Ferrothorn and Genesect. Trick allows Latios to cripple an opposing wall, enhancing its wallbreaking power. Thunderbolt or Thunder can also be used to better hit Azumarill, Togekiss, and Mandibuzz. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Aegislash harder, but due to its inability to hit Genesect and Lucario super effectively makes it generally inferior to Hidden Power Fire.

Set Details
========

This Latios aims to be a premier wallbreaker. As such, the EVs maximize its damage output while keeping its ability to outspeed notable threats such as Terrakion and Keldeo and Speed tie with Gengar. Choice Specs increases Latios's damage output to allow it to hit as hard as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Latios should never be on the field for too many turns in a row, as it serves best as a hit-and-run attacker. Be wary of spamming Draco Meteor too much, as a myriad of popular threats can set up against a Choice-locked -2 Latios. Also, be careful about Tricking away Latios's Choice item too soon, as a well-timed Trick can be devastating to a wall.

Team Options
========

Being Choice-locked, Latios lures many Pursuit users. As a result, Pokemon such as Bisharp and Terrakion that can set up against common Pursuit users such as Tyranitar make for good partners. Similarly, checks to Aegislash and Togekiss such as Zapdos are also appreciated. Finally, Latios greatly appreciates partners with momentum attacks such as Volt Switch and U-turn, which give it free switch-ins to then nuke the opponent. This makes both Genesect and Rotom-W excellent partners.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Surf / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Trick / Hidden Power Fire
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

This set transforms Latios into an incredibly potent revenge killer, outspeeding nearly every boosting sweeper in the metagame. Draco Meteor is Latios's most powerful attack and the attack often most used when revenging. Psyshock gets good neutral coverage in conjunction with Draco Meteor, taking care of troublesome threats such as Keldeo, Mega Venusaur, and Gengar. Surf beats Fire-types such as Heatran, Entei, and Talonflame, while Hidden Power Fire beats Scizor and Genesect. Trick allows Latios to cripple walls that it has trouble breaking through. If using Latios in the rain, Thunder can be used to better hit Azumarill, Togekiss, and Mandibuzz.

Set Details
========

As this Latios is a potent revenge killer, the EVs focus on maximizing both Latios's Speed and Special Attack stats so that it can be as fast as possible and hit as hard as possible.

Usage Tips
========

As a revenge killer, Latios should only come out sparingly so as to maximize its longevity. Overuse of Draco Meteor can potentially lead to an opposing threat setting up easily against Latios, so Latios needs to be careful about its choice of moves. Trick should also be used fairly conservatively, as even when using it cripples an opposing wall Latios loses its ability to revenge many popular boosting sweepers.

Team Options
========

This revenge killer greatly appreciates partners with momentum attacks, such as U-turn and Volt Switch, which allow it more opportunities to switch in. Latios struggles to take down Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Aegislash, and Togekiss without Tricking away its Choice item, making Zapdos and Rotom-W excellent partners. Given its typing and the fact that it is Choice-locked, Latios lures many Pursuit users. As such, Pokemon such as Mega Lucario, which can set up against the Pursuit users mentioned earlier, also make for excellent partners.

Other Options
########

A Calm Mind set is usable, but is generally outclassed by Latias due to Latios's lack of longevity. Similarly, a fully defensive set making use of Defog and Heal Block suffers from Latios's lack of longevity and would be better used by Latias. Latios can also make use of a Dragon Dance set, but due to its innately low Attack stat, such a set is better done by other popular Dragon-types such as Dragonite. Latios can facilitate a teammate's setup with a dual screens + Memento set, but it is fairly outclassed by Deoxys-S in this role.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: If Latios lacks Trick, special walls such as Chansey and Sylveon are able to reliably wall Latios. Fairy-types do exceptionally well, as Latios lacks a reliable way to damage them.

**Offensive Checks**: Latios's checks and counters vary depending on the coverage moves it chooses. Azumarill and Togekiss do well against Latios if it is lacking Thunderbolt, while Genesect, Aegislash, and Scizor do well if Latios lacks Hidden Power Fire.

**Pursuit Users**: Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Mega Scizor make for good counters to Latios, as they can take a hit and prevent Latios from switching out.
