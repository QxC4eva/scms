<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Tier Shift was created with the intention of making less viable Pok&eacute;mon more competitive. The main principle is that each Pok&eacute;mon below the OU tier gets a buff to its BST—anywhere from +5 to a massive +15. You would think all Pok&eacute;mon not named Feebas would become viable, but that's certainly not the case. This article aims to prepare you for some common threats everyone should be ready for. If you can deal with these, you will already be in the top half of Tier Shift players.</p>

<p>Below are some of the more common sets found in Tier Shift, followed by a brief explanation of why they work. For variety's sake, I have decided to leave weather setters out. Any OU player worth their salt will know about weather setters and how to deal with them. If you're interested in weather setting teams, please look at previous articles in the Smog series.</p>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/smog/issue27/tiershift_cresselia.png" alt="cresselia" /></div>

<h2>Common Sets</h2>

<h3>Cresselia</h3>

<div><img src="/download/sprites/bw/493.png" alt="cresselia" /></div>

<div class="stats">Stats: 130 HP / 80 Atk / 130 Def / 85 SpA / 140 SpD / 95 Spe</div>
<p>Cresselia is an amazing wall in Tier Shift—much like in standard doubles. Its high defenses, good support moves, and immunity to Ground-type moves make it an ideal teammate. Cresselia isn't without its flaws, however. Powerful physical attacks will leave a nasty dent in it, and the likes of Taunt, Trick, and Toxic will severely limit its capabilities. Despite this, Cresselia is an excellent pivot and special wall in the tier.</p>

<div class="set">Cresselia @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD<br />
Calm Nature (+SpD, -Atk)<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Moonlight</div>

<p>This set is designed to stop all special attackers cold in their tracks. Ice Beam is chosen as it provides the widest coverage and hits Dark-types harder than anything else. Cresselia can switch into almost any special attack in the game bar Choice Specs Chandelure's Shadow Ball. After a single Calm Mind, Latios's Draco Meteor does around 35%, letting Cresselia Moonlight back to full health. Although its Special Defense is far superior, its physical defense shouldn't be overlooked; Acrobatics from Archeops will never KO Cresselia and it can strike back with a powerful Ice Beam. If you have no check for Cresselia, be prepared for mayhem.</p>

<h3>Durant</h3>

<div><img src="/download/sprites/bw/662.png" alt="durant" /></div>

<div class="stats">Stats: 68 HP / 119 Atk / 122 Def / 58 SpA / 58 SpD / 119 Spe</div>

<p>Durant is a perfect example of a Pok&eacute;mon improved by Tier Shift. Thanks to its boosted Attack and Speed, Durant can pull off sweeps much more easily. One of its main selling points is its ability to boost up in Cresselia's face, OHKOing it with Hustle-boosted X-Scissor. Another advantage of using Durant is that it never has to worry about sandstorm teams as they rarely have a counter for it.</p>

<div class="set">Durant @ Bug Gem<br />
Ability: Hustle<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Hone Claws<br />
- Substitute<br />
- X-Scissor<br />
- Iron Head / Stone Edge</div>

<p>This set lends itself to early-game wallbreaking, using its immensely powerful X-Scissor to decimate anything in its path. Iron Head means Durant can smash its way through the high concentration of Rock-type Pok&eacute;mon in Tier Shift, and Stone Edge can catch a Fire-type on the switch in. A Lum Berry can provide extra protection against Prankster abusers, but a Bug Gem will make X-Scissor very dangerous.</p>

<h3>Sableye</h3>

<div><img src="/download/sprites/bw/302.png" alt="sableye" /></div>

<div class="stats">Stats: 55 HP / 80 Atk / 80 Def / 70 SpA / 70 SpD / 55 Spe</div>

<p>Thanks to Prankster and Will-O-Wisp, Sableye can put a stop to almost any physical sweeper. Its defenses aren't anything to boast about, but an immunity to Fighting- and Psychic-type attacks makes it fairly easy to switch in. Sableye is by no means a spectacular Pok&eacute;mon; it just has the right ability and movepool to cause problems in almost any tier it's played in.</p>

<div class="set">Sableye @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Prankster<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Will-O-Wisp<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Recover<br />
- Foul Play / Night Shade</div>

<p>Playing with Sableye is fairly straightforward. Prankster Will-O-Wisp along with Recover and Taunt turn Sableye into a decent physical tank and stall breaker. Will-O-Wisp effectively doubles Sableye's Defense, and prioritized Recover means Sableye can restore its health before taking a hit. Boosting Pok&eacute;mon, such as Cresselia, are brought to a standstill with Taunt, while Night Shade deals with them in the quickest way possible. Not much more to say. It's difficult to counter.</p>

<h3>Stoutland</h3>

<div><img src="/download/sprites/bw/536.png" alt="stoutland" /></div>

<div class="stats">Stats: 100 HP / 115 Atk / 105 Def / 60 SpA / 105 SpD / 95 Spe</div>

<p>Rising from the depths of PU, Stoutland is the reason all Tier Shift teams must carry a Normal-resist. Crunch, Return, Wild Charge, and Fire Fang provide excellent coverage, only stopped by a few select Pok&eacute;mon, such as Heatran, Regirock, and Tangrowth. Pok&eacute;mon with access to Mach Punch can take care of the former two, while special sweepers can deal with Tangrowth. A counter to Stoutland should always be considered when creating your team; otherwise, you will be caught off-guard.</p>

<div class="set">Stoutland @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Sand Rush<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Return<br />
- Wild Charge<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Fire Fang / Superpower</div>

<p>This set should only be used on sandstorm teams. Sand Rush raises Stoutland's Speed to a whopping 578, revenge killing many Pok&eacute;mon in the tier. That's not all; Stoutland requires no set up, making it an immediate threat. Its typing is also a boon, making it synergize well with common Ground-types found on sandstorm teams.</p>

<h3>Regirock</h3>

<div><img src="/download/sprites/bw/377.png" alt="regirock" /></div>

<div class="stats">Stats: 95 HP / 115 Atk / 215 Def / 65 SpA / 115 SpD / 65 Spe</div>

<p>Regirock is the third Pok&eacute;mon in this list helped by sand, and the strongest stat-wise. With its massive 95/215/115 defenses and a boost from sandstorm, Regirock becomes an unstoppable wall. With a single Curse, Regirock acts as a full stop to all forms of Stoutland and other Normal-type attackers. Regirock's main flaw is its lack of a reliable recovery move and vulnerability to Sunny Day teams. If you ever need a check to sandstorm teams, Regirock is the way to go.</p>

<div class="set">Regirock @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD<br />
Impish Nature (+Def, -SpA)<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk<br />
- Curse<br />
- Stone Edge</div>

<p>During a sandstorm, this set is almost impossible to knock out. With full investment in Special Defense and a boost from sandstorm, neither a Kyurem-B's Outrage nor a Chandelure's Shadow Ball can OHKO it. The majority of special attackers can only dream of 3HKOing Regirock, so it can Curse up before Resting back to full health and proceeding to sweep. Regirock is not without its weaknesses, however; Trick, weather changers, and setup boosters can force it out. Once these threats are dealt with, Regirock can do some major damage.</p>

<h3>Sawsbuck</h3>

<div><img src="/download/sprites/bw/616.png" alt="sawsbuck" /></div>

<div class="stats">Stats: 95 HP / 115 Atk / 85 Def / 75 SpA / 85 SpD / 110 Spe</div>

<p>Remember when I said Stoutland was the reason all teams carry a Normal-resist? I wasn't being entirely honest there. Sawsbuck is known as the the Stoutland of the sun, but with more diverse coverage and better Speed. Apart from Shedinja, Sawsbuck is a difficult Pok&eacute;mon to counter. Heatran with its Air Balloon still intact can force it out, while Pok&eacute;mon carrying Mach Punch and Ice Shard can overcome Sawsbuck's high Speed. Skarmory is probably your best bet against it, though it can be 2HKOed by Wild Charge.</p>

<div class="set">Sawsbuck @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Chlorophyll<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -Spe)<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Horn Leech<br />
- Nature Power<br />
- Wild Charge / Megahorn / Jump Kick</div>

<p>This set can sweep very easily when sun is up. Just switch into a Water- or Rock-type Pok&eacute;mon and Swords Dance as they switch out. At +2 Attack, Sawsbuck can 2HKO everything in the metagame with the appropriate coverage move. If you're afraid of Skarmory, use Wild Charge; if you can't get rid of Cresselia, use Megahorn; and if you just want to have general coverage that can deal with Air Balloon Heatran, Jump Kick is great. Sawsbuck is very weak to priority moves; just make sure you get rid of the appropriate Mach Punch / Ice Shard users before trying to sweep.</p>

<h3>Sigilyph</h3>

<div><img src="/download/sprites/bw/591.png" alt="sigilyph" /></div>

<div class="stats">Stats: 82 HP / 68 Atk / 90 Def / 113 SpA / 90 SpD / 107 Spe</div>

<p>Sigilyph is another Pok&eacute;mon that benefits from increased bulk. A lot of common threats in the tier are physical, meaning Sigilyph can neuter them with Psycho Shift, rendering them completely impotent. For example, if Stoutland is burned, it poses no threat to the opposing team. Sigilyph also preys on the few Dark-type Pok&eacute;mon commonly used. Scrafty and Hydreigon don't gain anything in Tier Shift, and other Dark-types, such as Absol and Houndoom, are often passed over for Zangoose or Chandelure, respectively.</p>

<div class="set">Sigilyph @ Flame Orb<br />
Ability: Magic Guard<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD<br />
Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Cosmic Power<br />
- Stored Power<br />
- Roost<br />
- Psycho Shift</div>

<p>This set has swept my teams more than I can count. Since I like to use physically-oriented Pok&eacute;mon and tend to carry no Dark-types, it can take all the power from my Pok&eacute;mon and set up faster than my Calm Mind Cresselia. The idea is to switch into a Fighting-type or a wall, set up with Cosmic Power, Psycho Shift a burn onto any physical Pok&eacute;mon, then sweep with Stored Power. If you don't like being walled by Dark-types, switch Stored Power out for Air Slash, which despite being much weaker, can hit all types.</p>

<h3>Jynx</h3>

<div><img src="/download/sprites/bw/124.png" alt="jynx" /></div>

<div class="stats">Stats: 80 HP / 65 Atk / 50 Def / 130 SpA / 110 SpD / 110 Spe</div>

<p>Jynx is an amazing abuser of two different weathers at the same time, a trait more common in Tier Shift than standard OU. With its Ice typing, it can fire off a powerful Blizzard and with is ability Dry Skin, it can run Life Orb with no net damage in the rain. It commonly runs a Life Orb set in the rain or a Choice set in hail, but it will always blast holes in the opposition.</p>

<div class="set">Jynx @ Choice Specs<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Psyshock<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Focus Blast</div>

<p>This set is an excellent addition to your hail team, or any team in general. If you can predict correctly, Jynx can blast holes in the opponent's team and leave it crippled and broken for a final sweeper to come in. Blizzard and Psyshock are the STAB moves of choice. Hidden Power Fire can dispatch Forretress, Durant, Ferrothorn, and Escavalier, while Focus Blast can deal with the likes of Heatran.</p>

<h3>Skarmory</h3>

<div><img src="/download/sprites/bw/227.png" alt="skarmory" /></div>

<div class="stats">Stats: 65 HP / 80 Atk / 140 Def / 40 SpA / 70 SpD / 70 Spe</div>

<p>Skarmory is the first and only OU Pok&eacute;mon in this list. Tier Shift is a developing metagame, and most people tend to go with Pok&eacute;mon they wish they could use in OU, but can't. This makes the metagame more centralized among NU Pok&eacute;mon. Many OU Pok&eacute;mon are still viable in Tier Shift, Skarmory being one of them. It fills the same roles as it does in OU: a hazard setter, a phazer, and a physical wall.</p>

<div class="set">Skarmory @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def<br />
Impish Nature (+Def, -SpA)<br />
- Roost<br />
- Brave Bird<br />
- Spikes / Stealth Rock<br />
- Whirlwind</div>

<p>The set may seem familiar to you, but there's a big difference between this and its OU version. In Tier Shift, Skarmory can only carry one set of hazards. Roost, Brave Bird, and Whirlwind are required. Whirlwind is vital because of the greater concentration of setup sweepers in the tier. This is more common in Tier Shift than in OU, so Whirlwind is most needed.</p>

<h3>Shedinja</h3>

<div><img src="/download/sprites/bw/292.png" alt="shedinja" /></div>

<div class="stats">Stats: 16 HP / 105 Atk / 60 Def / 45 SpA / 45 SpD / 55 Spe</div>

<p>Tier Shift grants Shedinja the most valuable gift it could have: 15 extra HP. It no longer fears sandstorm, hail, or other passive damage. Its 105 Attack is not too shabby, and combined with Swords Dance and Shadow Sneak, it can pose a major threat to teams lacking super effective coverage. One memorable battle for me involved my Regigigas PP stalling a Shedinja whose only attack was Shadow Sneak. Be prepared for long battles if you decide to use Shedinja.</p>

<div class="set">Shedinja @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Wonder Guard<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
-Hone Claws<br />
-Substitute<br />
-Shadow Sneak<br />
-Baton Pass</div>

<p>Unlike the set described above, this set aims to switch into something that can't damage it, set up a Substitute or Hone Claws, and then Baton Pass to a recipient. Hone Claws is used because Swords Dance is incompatible with Baton Pass. The main benefit that Shedinja has over its brother Ninjask is its ability to force a Pok&eacute;mon out and gain a free turn. This is very important because both Hone Claws and Substitute work well if a Pok&eacute;mon that could KO Shedinja comes in.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>All the discussed threats are very capable of sweeping a team. If, or optimistically, when, you build a Tier Shift team, make sure you have Pok&eacute;mon capable of stopping them. Luckily, none of these have any less than seven counters, and many more could be discovered. Just be creative in your choices. Who knows, maybe you will find the next greatest threat while experimenting. Go out and do that!</p>
