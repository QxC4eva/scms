<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At the end of each turn, the wielder has a random stat boosted by two stages, and a random stat lowered by one stage. Accuracy and evasion are included. Moody will not boost and lower the same stat in a single turn. When Moody is activated at the end of the turn, the game selects from an array of 42 options (each corresponding to a separate combination of stats) and simultaneously determines which stat will be boosted and which will be lowered. If a stat is already at -6 or +6, all options that would lower or raise that stat respectively are eliminated before selection unless that process removes every option (for example, if a Pokemon had +6 in every stat, the game will simply lower one random stat without boosting another).</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/bidoof">Bidoof</a> nearly had to be banned because of this ability. Bidoof. All the Pokemon that obtain this ability have a way of abusing it to get ridiculous levels of stat boosts and eventually become able to steamroll their way through an entire team. The ability itself is very easy to take advantage of, by wasting time with <a href="/bw/moves/protect">Protect</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a> until you get a load of evasion boosts, and unless one is using a defensive <a href="/bw/pokemon/bibarel">Bibarel</a>, in which case <a href="/bw/abilities/unaware">Unaware</a> is preferred, Moody is almost always the best option. Indeed, it is thought to be so overpowered that Smogon does not allow the use of Moody in any of its standard metagames, including Ubers.</p>
