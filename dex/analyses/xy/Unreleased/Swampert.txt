Set
#############
name: 1 [ORAS] Swampert
item: Swampertite
ability: Damp
evss: 100 HP / 252 Atk / 156 Spe
nature: Adamant
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Ice Punch

This Mega Swampert set gets up rain for itself with relying on teammates. 156 Speed EVs is enough to outspeed Timid Sceptile. Waterfall and Earthquake are the obligatory STAB attacks, which hit very hard off Mega Swampert's huge 150 Attack, and Ice Punch lets Swampert hit the Grass-types that wall both of its STABs. Damp ability is used over Torrent for preventing enemies for exploding, but mostly Torrent would be a waste; Swampert will be Mega Evolving long before it finds itself in Torrent's activation range.

name: 2 [ORAS Doubles] Swampert
item: Swampertite
nature: Adamant / Naughty
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def
move 1: Waterfall
move 2: Ice Punch / Ice Beam
move 3: Earthquake / Superpower
move 4: Protect

With its new Mega form, Swampert is finally a Pokémon that could be a dominating factor in the metagame. 150 base Attack in tandem with 100/110/110 defenses makes Swampert a very threatening tank. Being able to hit nearly every common Pokemon for super-effective damage with the correct set also helps. Waterfall is always going to be Swampert's main STAB, with Earthquake and an Ice-type move providing it with near perfect coverage. Superpower can also be used to hit Pokémon like Mega Kangaskhan and Ferrothorn.
