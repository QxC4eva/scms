[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder will deal damage to the opponent equal to 1/8 of the opponent's maximum HP if it is hit by a contact move. Stacks with <a href="/bw/items/rocky_helmet">Rocky Helmet</a>. If the wielder is hit multiple times by the same contact move, for example by <a href="/bw/moves/tail_slap">Tail Slap</a>, then the wielder will deal damage on every hit. If the opponent faints due to Rough Skin damage in the midst of a multi-hit contact move, the move will end. If the opponent uses any of <a href="/bw/moves/bug_bite">Bug Bite</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/circle_throw">Circle Throw</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/dragon_tail">Dragon Tail</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/pluck">Pluck</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/rapid_spin">Rapid Spin</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/smellingsalt">SmellingSalt</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/wake-up_slap">Wake-Up Slap</a>, and then immediately faints due to the damage from Rough Skin, then the effect of that move will not take place. The damage dealt is not blocked by <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This ability, while good, is not seen very much. <a href="/bw/pokemon/garchomp">Garchomp</a> has it, but will only use it because <a href="/bw/abilities/sand_veil">Sand Veil</a> is banned in standard play. <a href="/bw/pokemon/druddigon">Druddigon</a> has two other good abilities to choose from, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/sharpedo">Sharpedo</a> always prefers <a href="/bw/abilities/speed_boost">Speed Boost</a>. It would be good if it was found on Pokemon who could take advantage of the ability, but none of the current ones really can.</p>
