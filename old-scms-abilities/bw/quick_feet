Speed is increased by 50% when afflicted with status.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is affected by burn, freeze, paralysis, poison, or sleep, its Speed is increased by 50%. Furthermore, the Speed drop of paralysis is nullified (but the chance of being fully paralyzed is not). Unlike <a href="/bw/abilities/guts">Guts</a>, Quick Feet does not nullify the Attack-lowering effect of burn.</p>

<p>If a user of Quick Feet leads the party in game, the wild encounter rate drops by 50%.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Quick Feet will not see much use competitively but it does make for some interesting combinations. <a href="/bw/pokemon/ursaring">Ursaring</a> with Quick Feet and <a href="/bw/moves/facade">Facade</a> can be a dangerous threat in the lower tiers if it is unexpected, though is still somewhat slow. <a href="/bw/pokemon/jolteon">Jolteon</a> is a better all-round Pokemon than Ursaring but would much rather have <a href="/bw/abilities/volt_absorb">Volt Absorb</a> than <a href="/bw/abilities/quick_feet">Quick Feet</a> anyway.</p>
