<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 20% chance to boost the user's Attack by one stage. Damage is boosted to 1.2x by the ability Iron Fist.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Metagross is the best and most common user of Meteor Mash, which is a powerful STAB move. It is an excellent attacking choice since it can raise Metagross's Attack by one stage, making it deal even more damage. However, very few Pokemon get this move, so it is rarely seen anywhere else.</p>
