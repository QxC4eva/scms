Overview
########

Tentacool once again finds a niche in the LC metagame thanks to its typing and movepool. In addition to the wonderful resistances a water/poison typing has always brought, fairy types have given Tentacool a new niche by allowing it to check threats such as Calm Mind Spritzee. Solid special bulk coupled with decent speed for a defensively oriented Pokemon make it a good special pivot. With an excellent supportive movepool which includes gems such as Knock Off and Rapid Spin, Tentacool can cause quite a headache for the opposing team, and the unbanning of Berry Juice gives Tentacool a chance to bypass the issue of lacking recovery once. However, its pathetic physical bulk leaves Tentacool as a shaky check to physical fire and fighting types such as Ponyta and Mienfoo, and once Berry Juice has been used up, Tentacool is very prone to being worn down. These traits in conjunction with Tentacool's weaknesses to common electric, ground and psychic attacks leave much to be desired from the jellyfish.

Moves
========
Access to notable moves such as Rapid Spin and Knock Off gives Tentacool the opportunity to function as an acceptable defensive support Pokemon. Being able to use the coveted Rapid Spin is one of Tentacool's big draws, since removing hazards from your side of the field while retaining hazards on the opponent's is quite useful. Sludge Bomb and Scald act as reliable STAB moves for Tentacool, and each carries a bonus chance to status the enemy with poison or burn, respectively. Knock Off hits much of the item-reliant LC metagame hard thanks to the buff of its base power to 65 this generation. However, Toxic Spikes is another rare move Tentacool can boast access to, and can be used in the last slot instead if deemed necessary.

Set Details
========

Tentacool is best used by taking advantage of its phenomenal special bulk, and the EVs and nature are designed to do so, with the remaining EVs being put in defense in an effort to make Tentacool a better overall wall, and speed to leave Tentacool at a respectable 14 speed. A Bold nature with a physically defensive spread can be used instead, but Tentacool will still have trouble taking powerful physical hits due to its naturally low defense. Berry Juice is the preferred item because otherwise, Tentacool lacks any form of recovery whatsoever, which is not ideal for a defensive Pokemon. Liquid Ooze is the recommended ability because it can help turn the tables on Pokemon who use draining moves such as Leech Seed or Giga Drain in certain situations.

Usage Tips
========

Despite its numerous resistances, the lack of consistent recovery and physical bulk means that Tentacool should be switched in with caution. With that being said, Tentacool is best saved for mid game when you want to change the tide of the battle by getting rid of hazards or knocking off an opponent’s item. Despite Tentacool's low base special attack, Sludge Bomb's high base power allows Tentacool to actually deal a fair bit of damage, so with Tentacool's acceptable coverage and speed, it can attempt to weaken slower teams.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can take advantage of a clear field, such as Ponyta and Murkrow, are primary candidates for teammates. Larvesta in particular decimates psychic types with U-Turn while Tentacool resists Larvesta's water weakness. Good physical tanks work well by making up for Tentacool's weaker defense. Slowpoke can take on Fire-types and Fighting-types that Tentacool couldn’t hope to wall. To increase Tentacool’s longevity further, Wish support is also appreciated, especially from the likes of Spritzee, because Tentacool can switch in on the Steel, Poison, and Fire moves aimed at it. Chinchou is able to keep Tentacool free of status with Heal Bell, and absorbs the electric attacks aimed at Tentacool. Tentacool synergizes well with other Knock Off users by forcing a large portion of the enemy team to forgo their items.

Other Options
########

Giga Drain is an option for an attacking move that lets Tentacool hit grasses pretty hard while recovering some HP, but most Pokemon don't take much damage from it, so Sludge Bomb is usually the better option. Sludge Wave is interchangeable with Sludge Bomb depending on whether 5 base power or a 20% poison chance is considered more valuable. Tentacool has reasonable speed and access to Swords Dance, but physical sweeping should usually be left to even faster and more powerful Pokemon. As for items, Berry Juice is optimal, but an Eviolite set can be used with Wish support if the added bulk is particularly important.

Checks & Counters
########
**Tesshido**: Tesshido is immune to Sludge Bomb, resists Scald, and can hit back hard with Bullet Seed.
**Electric types**: Bulky electric types such as Chinchou and Magnemite can switch in and wreak havoc with their electric STAB.
**Slowpoke**: Slowpoke is bulky enough to take anything Tentacool can throw at it while healing off the damage with Slack Off and Regenerator, and can KO Tentacool with its psychic STAB.
**Croagunk**: Dry Skin Croagunk is immune to Scald and resists Sludge Bomb, allowing it to wear Tentacool out with Knock Off and Drain Punch.
**Fast ground types**: Although they won't appreciate taking Scald, fast ground types, once they manage to get in, will be able to severely damage Tentacool with Earthquake.
