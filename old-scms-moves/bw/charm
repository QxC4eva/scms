Lowers target's Attack by 2 stages.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Attack by two stages. Pokemon with the abilities Clear Body or Hyper Cutter are immune. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Competitively, lowering the opponent's stats has never been an effective strategy, as the opponent can freely switch out to negate all of your work. Therefore, Charm is a very rare sight, and should only be used on a Pokemon with recovery, decent Special Defense, and significant entry hazard support; Charm can be effective in forcing switches. Generally, though, it is a better idea if possible to boost your Pokemon's Defense stat, since this cannot be easily negated by the opponent switching.</p>
