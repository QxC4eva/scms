<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In singles, Rock Slide is typically only used on Pokemon that do not have Stone Edge (i.e. Excadrill in Ubers). The main problem with Rock Slide is that its imperfect 90% accuracy, while better than Stone Edge's 80% accuracy, is not very attractive, which makes the power loss compared to Stone Edge hardly worth it. With that being said, Rock Slide is frequently used by physical attackers with the Sheer Force ability, such as Braviary. Sheer Force boosts Rock Slide's measly 75 Base Power to an impressive 97 Base Power. This makes Rock Slide almost as powerful as Stone Edge with greater accuracy. In fact, Pokemon such as Sheer Force Darmanitan use Rock Slide over Stone Edge for this sole reason.</p>

<p>In VGC, Rock Slide is quite a bit more important. The main reason for this is that it is a spread attack with no immunities that pairs well with Earthquake. The flinching possibility is the icing on the cake, since flinches are not only critical in VGC, but can also affect both opposing Pokemon. Many Pokemon who typically use Stone Edge in singles (such as Garchomp and Terrakion) switch to Rock Slide in VGC for these reasons.</p>
