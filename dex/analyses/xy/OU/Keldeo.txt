Overview
########

The superstar of BW, Keldeo returns to OU in XY to continue to wreak havoc upon the tier. It has a great offensive and defensive typing, giving it multiple opportunities to switch in allowing it to hit a majority of the tier for neutral damage. Keldeo's signature move, Secret Sword, allows it to bypass many special walls such as Chansey, giving it a major niche over other special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y. Combined with its excellent base 129 Special Attack and base 108 Speed, this makes Keldeo a powerful sweeper and revenge killer capable of devastating unprepared teams.

Unfortunately, the transition to XY was not very kind to Keldeo. The changed mechanics of Drizzle mean that Keldeo can no longer take advantage of rain as well as it could in the past generation, and the introduction of new threats such as Fairy-types, which resist Secret Sword, and Talonflame, which can easily revenge kill Keldeo, make Keldeo's life much more miserable than it was in the past. To make matters worse, Keldeo also faces a large amount of competition with Greninja for a teamslot, as Greninja has greater Speed, a much better ability, and a better movepool. Despite these shortcomings, Keldeo remains an excellent Pokemon in OU and is a great option on any offensive team.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Secret Sword
move 3: Scald
move 4: Icy Wind / Hidden Power Flying
item: Choice Specs / Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Keldeo's excellent Speed, power, and coverage make it one of the premier wallbreakers of OU. Hydro Pump is Keldeo's main STAB move due to its high Base Power and excellent neutral coverage. Secret Sword is Keldeo's secondary STAB attack, as it is not only more reliable than Hydro Pump but also hits common specially defensive walls with lower Defense stats such as Chansey and has excellent coverage with Hydro Pump. Scald is used as a more reliable Water-type STAB attack. Its 30% burn chance is able to cripple many of Keldeo's common checks, such as Mega Venusaur, Azumarill, and Latias, making it an excellent option. Icy Wind is generally the best coverage move in the third slot, as it hits Grass- and Dragon-types such as Roserade and Latias for super effective damage while also lowering the opponent's Speed. Hidden Power Flying is used primarily to 2HKO Keldeo's best check, Mega Venusaur, after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature is used to allow Keldeo to outspeed important threats such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Kyurem-B. Choice Specs is the recommended item, as it allows Keldeo to hit as hard as possible. If you prefer that Keldeo has the freedom of switching moves, then Life Orb can be used, but do note that Keldeo loses a lot of power without the Choice Specs and will be crippled by the Life Orb recoil. An Expert Belt can be used over both items, as it allows Keldeo to feign a Choice item. However, Expert Belt makes Keldeo significantly weaker than it would be if it is using a Choice Specs or Life Orb, making it the inferior item choice in most scenarios.

Usage Tips
========

Keldeo's high Speed and powerful STAB attacks make it perfect for mid- to late-game, as it can easily sweep the foe's team once its checks and counters are weakened. Keldeo still works very well early-game as well, as it can use its excellent coverage to enable another Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar and Scizor to sweep later in the game. Keldeo's excellent typing and decent bulk also make it an great switch-in to Rock-, Fire-, and Steel-types, as it can OHKO a majority of these type of Pokemon with its powerful STAB attacks.

The choice between using Hydro Pump and Scald depends on the current scenario. If Keldeo's counters such as Mega Venusaur and Azumarill are still intact, it is generally best to use Scald, as its 30% burn chance can cripple many of these Pokemon. If all of Keldeo's counters are either heavily weakened or eliminated, it is generally the best to use Hydro Pump, as its higher Base Power allows Keldeo to OHKO Pokemon that it could otherwise not take down with Scald, such as specially defensive Heatran, Scizor, and Mega Mawile after Stealth Rock damage. Hydro Pump is also the better move to use if the Pokemon Keldeo is up against can only be OHKOed by Hydro Pump and not Scald.

If the opponent has has Latios or Latias, it is generally a good idea to switch to a Pursuit user when Keldeo is active, as both of these Pokemon are common switch-ins to Keldeo. Keldeo should also be very cautious of what move it is using if it has Choice Specs, as various Pokemon may switch into a resisted attack and force Keldeo out.

Team Options
========

Keldeo appreciates entry hazard support to weaken its checks and counters. Garchomp and Ferrothorn are excellent partners for this role. Pursuit support from Aegislash, Bisharp and Tyranitar is recommended, as Keldeo appreciates the removal of Pokemon such as Latios and Latias from the match. Heatran is able to check a majority of Keldeo's common checks and counters, including Mega Venusaur, Latios, Talonflame, and Trevenant. Electric-types such as Rotom-W, Mega Manetric, and Thundurus are also good partners, as they are able to defeat Water-types such as Slowbro, Tentacruel, and Jellicent while also being able to provide momentum to switch Keldeo in safely with Volt Switch. Scizor is also able to provide momentum with U-Turn while also defeating common Fairy- and Dragon-type Pokemon that are able to check Keldeo. Rain support from Politoed or a manual rain setter such as Thundurus is also appreciated, as it increases the power of Keldeo's Water-type STAB attacks, making it much more difficult to defeat.

Endeavor
########
name: Endeavor
move 1: Endeavor
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 4: Secret Sword
ability: Justified
item: Salac Berry
evs: 8 HP / 248 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Endeavor is a very unexpected move, especially coming from Keldeo, as it is usually holding using Choice Specs or Life Orb. Endeavor is almost guaranteed to surprise your opponent because it cuts the foe's HP to equal that of the user. Substitute allows Keldeo to avoid being afflicted with status while lowering its health to maximize Endeavor damage and activate its Salac Berry. Hydro Pump and Secret Sword are Keldeo's bread and butter STAB moves that are capable of KOing many Pokemon in the tier. Scald can be used over Hydro Pump for its chance to inflict burns, which can help when trying to weaken opposing walls or cripple threats that may attempt to switch in. It also has better accuracy.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment is used in order to hit as hard as possible while maintaining as much Speed as possible. By using a Salac Berry, Keldeo is able to increase its Speed after its health drops below 25%, which helps when facing faster, offensive teams. After activating its Salac Berry, Keldeo doesn't have to worry about Speed tying with opposing Keldeo or Terrakion. It's also able to use Endeavor to weaken faster threats such as Latios, Thundurus, and Mega Manectric. The given EV spread maximizes Endeavor's damage, allowing Keldeo to lower the opposing Pokemon's health to 1 HP with Endeavor after using Substitute four times.

Usage Tips
========

Endeavor Keldeo is used as a lure to weaken popular checks and counters to Keldeo such as Mega Venusaur, Azumarill, and Amoonguss. It's possible for Keldeo to masquerade as a common Choice Specs variant early-game to lure the opponent into a false sense of security. Wait until mid- to late-game before revealing Substitute + Endeavor. Use Substitute until Keldeo's health drops below 25%, then use Endeavor to cripple Keldeo's common checks and counters. This set is best used on offensive or balanced teams that have trouble with specific walls. For example, one would use Endeavor to cripple Clefable and secure a Mega Tyranitar sweep. Because of its ability to easily weaken walls, Endeavor Keldeo can serve as an excellent win condition.

Team Options
========

Keldeo needs support from Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Scizor to deal with Psychic-types, namely Latios and Latias. Mega Charizard Y is also a great teammate for its ability to get rid of bulky Water- and Grass-type Pokemon that attempt to wall Keldeo. Mega Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, Mega Charizard X, Terrakion, Landorus, and Bisharp all value Keldeo's ability to cripple the tier's top defensive Pokemon, including Mega Venusaur, Clefable, Gyarados and more. Other Fighting-type Pokemon also benefit from the set's capabilities. For example, Terrakion no longer has to worry about Fairy- or Poison-types after they've been crippled by Keldeo, meaning it can dish out powerful Close Combats with little resistance.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 3: Secret Sword
move 4: Hidden Power Flying
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

With Calm Mind, Keldeo uses its fairly unique typing, high power, and good natural bulk to set up and sweep the opposing team. Hydro Pump is Keldeo's recommended Water-type STAB move due to its high Base Power, allowing Keldeo to OHKO offensive Aegislash after one round of Life Orb recoil. Despite Hydro Pump's excellent Base Power, Scald can be used in its place as a more reliable STAB attack, as the Special Attack boost makes up for Scald's lower Base Power. It also has a 30% burn chance, which is able to cripple many of Keldeo's counters such as Latias, Azumarill, and Mega Venusaur, as well as increase the amount of Keldeo's setup opportunities. Secret Sword is Keldeo's secondary STAB move, receiving great coverage with Keldeo's Water-type STAB attacks and hitting special walls such as Chansey for super effective damage. Hidden Power Flying hits many of Keldeo's common checks, such as Trevenent, Mega Venusaur, and Chesnaught, for super effective damage and receives perfect neutral coverage with Secret Sword and Keldeo's Water-type STAB attack. Icy Wind is an alternate coverage move that Keldeo can utilize to defeat various threats such as Dragonite and Salamence.

Set Details
========

Leftovers is the preferred item choice to increase Keldeo's longevity, making it easier for Keldeo to set up multiple Calm Minds. Life Orb can be used to give Keldeo a much greater damage output and allow it to function as a mid-game wallbreaker. Alternative items Keldeo can use include Lum Berry and Coba Berry. Lum Berry can be used if you prefer that Keldeo avoids taking damage from status moves, while a Coba Berry allows Keldeo to take moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack much better, but in general, both of these items are inferior to Life Orb and Leftovers.

Usage Tips
========

Keldeo is best used late-game once its checks and counters are removed, as it can set up Calm Mind with little to no trouble and sweep the foe's team. Keldeo can still be used as a mid-game wallbreaker if it is using a Life Orb and sweep later in the match. If the opponent has a faster check to Keldeo such as Latias or Talonflame, Keldeo should generally postpone setting up Calm Mind and either attack with its powerful STAB attacks or switch out into a Pokemon that can defeat its checks.

The primary obstacles in Keldeo's sweep are Latios, Latias, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir, so it should be your number one priority to remove these threats. Having a Pursuit user such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Scizor can keep Latios and Latias in check, while having Stealth Rock down on the field can put both Talonflame and Mega Pinsir in a bad position.

Keldeo's excellent typing also allows it to set up Calm Mind against Dark-, Steel-, and Rock-types such as Bisharp, Scizor, and Tyranitar. Setting up one to two times is generally enough for Keldeo to sweep.

Team Options
========

Landorus and Ferrothorn are great partners for Keldeo, as the entry hazards they provide weaken a majority of Keldeo's counters. Scizor is also a great partner, as it is able to provide momentum with U-turn while also being able to defeat a large majority of Keldeo's checks and counters. Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus are also able to provide momentum for Keldeo with Volt Switch while also checking Water- and Flying-types that generally give Keldeo trouble. Heatran is a great partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock while also defeating a large majority of Keldeo's checks, including Latias, Sylveon, and Mega Venusaur. Aegislash, Bisharp, and Tyranitar are also great partners, as all three of them are able to Pursuit trap a large majority of Keldeo's counters, making it easier for Keldeo to sweep. Keldeo also appreciates rain support from Politoed or a manual Rain Dance user such as Thundurus, as it boosts the power of Keldeo's Water-type STAB moves, making it generally easier for Keldeo to sweep.

Other Options
########

Keldeo's poor movepool leaves it with very few alternative options. A Choice Scarf set can be used, allowing Keldeo to revenge kill miscellaneous threats such as Terrakion and Gengar, but its effectiveness has diminished in the transition to XY due to its mediocre damage output, poor coverage, and vulnerability to threats such as Talonflame. Keldeo can also run a Substitute + Calm Mind set fairly effectively, utilizing Substitute to block priority moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack as well as status moves such as Toxic. Similarly to the Choice Scarf set however, this set has also lowered in effectiveness due to the rise in usage of threats that resist Keldeo's STAB attacks, such as Dragonite, Azumarill, and Mega Venusaur, its inability to break Pokemon such as Unaware Clefable, and the lack of permanent rain. Taunt is a viable move that Keldeo can run, allowing it to prevent moves such as Defog and Thunder Wave, although Keldeo loses to a majority of the Pokemon utilizing these moves anyway. Rain Dance is a viable move Keldeo can use to boost the power of its Water-type STAB attacks, but Keldeo rarely has room to run it. Substitute can be used to take advantage of the switches Keldeo forces. Other Hidden Power types can also be to hit niche targets, such as using Hidden Power Grass for Gastrodon or Hidden Power Psychic for Tentacruel.

Keldeo can also use an alternative moveset with the moves Substitute / Endeavor / Toxic / Scald to lure its common counters, most notably Mega Venusaur. However, such a set is very gimmicky and is not recommended to be used.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Mega Venusaur is Keldeo's best counter, as apart from Hidden Power Flying, Keldeo cannot significantly damage Mega Venusaur, while Mega Venusaur can recover all of its health lost with Synthesis and 2HKO Keldeo with Giga Drain.

**Water-types**: Slowbro and Slowking are good counters, as apart from a super effective Hidden Power or a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump, they fear little to nothing from Keldeo and can either cripple it with Thunder Wave or hit it hard with a super effective Psyshock. Azumarill is able to switch into Keldeo's STAB attacks and either OHKO it with Play Rough or set up a Belly Drum as Keldeo switches out.

**Fairy-types**: Azumarill resists both of Keldeo's STAB attacks and can OHKO it with Play Rough. Specially defensive Clefable is a great check to Calm Mind Keldeo, as it ignores Calm Mind boosts due to Unaware and can 2HKO Keldeo with Moonblast. However, specially defensive Clefable has a high chance of being 2HKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock, making it a very situational check.

**Dragon-types**: Latios, Latias, and Noivern resist Keldeo's STAB attacks and are able to outspeed and OHKO with their respective super effective STAB attacks. Noivern can only switch into Keldeo once, however, as a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump deals a large amount of damage to it. Dragonite resists both of Keldeo's STAB attacks and can either OHKO Keldeo with a Choice Band-boosted Outrage or set up Dragon Dance. However, all of these Pokemon take massive damage from Icy Wind.

**Revenge Killers**: Talonflame is able to easily revenge kill Keldeo with its priority Brave Bird. However, Talonflame is unable to switch into Keldeo's Water-type STAB moves and will lose to Keldeo if it has a Substitute up. Mega Pinsir is in a similar situation as Talonflame, except it requires Keldeo to have taken some prior damage before its Quick Attack is able to KO it. Alakazam and Thundurus are able to switch into Keldeo's Fighting-type STAB attacks and OHKO it with their respective STAB attacks. However, all of these Pokemon are OHKOed by Keldeo's Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock.
