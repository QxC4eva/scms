<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The sweet joy of playing an MMO has finally come to life, publicly and for all users to see, with the new MMO Room! We have gathered as enthusiasts of the MMO genre to bring to you all a room dedicated to bringing together lovers of the genre and even converting some of you to fans of the category. We hope to provide assistance with any game, as well as introduce you to games you may not have heard of.</p>
<strong>Contributing:</strong>
<p>As a whole, the chat discusses and plays games of the MMO genre, we do not speak badly of any one game, and we are dedicated to finding a new release or diamond in the rough. We implore users to bring new games to the table, and encourage everyone to try them. Finding and playing games together with our users is fun, so why not try new things? All games are discussed as long as they are of the MMO genre. MOBAs are NOT MMOs. (I'm looking at you, League of Legends and DOTA. Get outta here.) We love playing games, and we love you. Being a good chat presence, playing games, and helping us find games are some of the easiest ways to contribute to and help out the room as a whole.</p>

<h3>Description of Popular Games</h3>

<strong>MapleStory:</strong>
<p><em>Maplestory</em> is a free-to-play 2D game developed by Wizet and published by Nexon. You can play the game in most countries. MapleStory doesn't have a specific plot other than leveling up and increasing your stats. Using the keyboard and mouse, guide your 2D hero through many battles, dungeons, and shops to advance your character. There are a wide variety of classes and subclasses, making the character selection and even role-playing in the game very diverse. The art style and character line make this game worth at least trying.</p>
<strong>RuneScape:</strong>
<p><em>RuneScape</em> is a free-to-play 3D open world MMORPG developed by Jagex. The game involves a lot of customization, from your character to what skills you can master. Guiding your character along quests and skills, you can master skills for unique capes and items and complete quests for specific areas and items. There are no specific classes in RuneScape; your skills determine whether you are good with a shortbow or a dagger. There are MANY different types of weapons in the game, and with magic included, even more spells. Making money with skills and getting new gear to fair better in Player vs Player or Player vs Monster combat is what makes this game both addicting and fun with friends.</p>
<strong>Realm of the Mad God:</strong>
<p><em>Realm of the Mad God (RotMG)</em> is a free-to-play 2D dungeon blasting MMORPG originally developed by Wild Shadow Studios and later acquired by Kabam. The game has a class laddering system, which means that you need to complete a certain level requirement in one class to unlock another. Items and stats are the only things that you care about in RotMG. The easiest way to play is to acquire a character that you like, max out your level, and then grind dungeons for stat potions. RotMG also features "perma-death", which means that when your character dies, you lose everything that's not stored in your storage chests, excluding pets. When you die, you are brought back to the menu screen and are rewarded with "fame" when you decease. You then select either the same class or a new one and start over. This added thrill of having only one life makes the game extraordinarily fun.</p>
<strong>Aura Kingdom:</strong>
<p><em>Aura Kingdom</em> is a free-to-play anime-style MMORPG developed by X-Legend and published by Aeria Games. The game has a LARGE scaling depending on what classes you pick, but the quests are more or less the same. You pick a companion to aide you along your journey, and eventually pick a subclass to make your character stronger. Aura Kingdom features a unique quest style that makes you feel like you're reading an open -world visual novel. With many classes to pick from and fun companions to have, this game can envelop you for hours.</p>
<strong>Treasure Arena:</strong>
<p><em>Treasure Arena</em> is an online battle arena style MMORPG that you can play with a smaller group of people. We like to call Treasure Arena an "LMORPG", or "Limited Multiplayer Role-Playing Game". Treasure Arena features a few classes to change the look of your character, but they do not change gameplay. You enter a map and are required to best your opponents by collecting coins. You can kill the other players for their coins, as well as get power-ups. These power-ups can be anything from a multitude of bombs to just a bow and arrow. The classic and yet still entertaining slash -and -dash style of Treasure Arena makes it a pleasant and enjoyable experience.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<strong>What is an MMORPG?</strong>
<p>MMORPG stands for Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. These are games with online servers in which you play as a character and interact with others. Some popular examples are MapleStory, RuneScape, Aura Kingdom, Realm of the Mad God, etc.</p>
<strong>I found a game! How do I add it to the discussion?</strong>
<p>To add a game, you will need to message a Room Owner. The Room Owner will add that game to the list. You will be asked if you play this game actively, because discussion is supposed to be focused around actively played games. If you played this game 6 years ago and remember your account, I would advise that you start playing it again before trying to add it to the discussion.</p>
<strong>Who is Queen Arrow, and what is she doing?</strong>
<p>Queen Arrow is a custom bot created by Quinella and myself, to help aid the staff and the users in general with JavaScript. (Thanks Quin. &lt;3) To add your username to a game, you use the command, ".adduser &lt;Name of Game/Alias&gt;, &lt;Username in specified game&gt;. This will put your username in a stored list of data for that game. (Note: You can only add you username to an EXISTING GAME. This game has to have been added previously by a Room Owner.) To show your information for all games, use ".user". You can also use ".user &lt;User in chat&gt;" to see if they play any games and what their usernames are for these games.</p>
