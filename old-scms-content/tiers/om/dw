<h3>What is Dream World OU?</h3>

<p>Despite once being recognized as an official metagame, Dream World OU has since been demoted to that of an "other metagame." Some of you may ask, "what separates DW OU and OU?" Firstly, every Pokemon has its hidden ability available for use. This turns previously ignored Pokemon, such as Chandelure and Serperior, into top tier threats. Secondly, DW OU has its own unique banlist, or rather, un-banlist. Titans who once ravaged the plains of OU make their home in DW OU: Excadrill, Deoxys-S, Thundurus, Manaphy, Garchomp, and even Darkrai roam free in DW OU.</p>

<h3>Specific rules:</h3>
<ul>
<li>All Dream World abilities can be used.</li>
<li>Deoxys-S, Excadrill, Garchomp, Manaphy, Thundurus, and Darkrai are not banned in DW OU.</li> 
</ul>
