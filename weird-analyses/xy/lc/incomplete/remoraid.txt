SET NAME
########
name: Mixed Scarf
move 1: Water Spout
move 2: Scald / Ice Beam
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Bullet Seed / Seed Bomb
ability: Sniper
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 236 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Rash

Moves
========

    Water Spout is the most effective Water-type attack in the game (when Remoraid is at full health) and should always be used for huge damage.
    Seed Bomb and Bullet Seed both provide excellent coverage and good damage with Remoraid's base 65 Attack. Only use Seed Bomb for reliability on Chinchou and Staryu.
    Scald is a reliable, threatening Water-type option, especially if Remoraid is weakened. Ice Beam is a very good coverage move and another option to hit Lileep and Flying-types. It is also a very powerful move.
    Fire Blast hits for great coverage on Steel- and Grass-types, and has a high base power to boot.

Set Details
========

    The EVs give Remoraid boosts to both offensive stats and Speed, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO or 2HKO the majority of non-defensive pokemon in the tier.
    Sniper was nerfed this generation with the rest of critical-related attacks, but it still allows certain OHKOs that are impossible without it.
    The Rash nature increases Special Attack even further than the EV spread, and it comes at no real cost to Remoraid, because it generally can't survive powerful special attacks anyway.

Usage Tips
========

    Remoraid is best used as a Choice sweeper, due to its high offenses and good coverage.
    Any team requiring a powerful and fast mixed attacker would do well to consider this variant of Remoraid, as it has all of those qualities.
    Remoraid's team still needs to support it.
    Powerful walls are necessary to tank hits meant for Remoraid, because it is excruciatingly frail and has little in the way of recovery.

Team Options
========

    As stated, walls help Remoraid out by taking hits that would kill the Jet Pokemon.
    A Baton Pass could help Remoraid if it boosted Remoraid's defenses to allow it to stay in through the first hit of a 2HKO.
    Remoraid's two weaknesses, Electric and Grass, are covered by Fire and Ground, so it is well-supported by these two types.
    Wish allows Remoraid to hit hard with Water Spout after being damaged, so it can be very helpful. This is especially true late in battle.


SET NAME
########
name: Special Choice
move 1: Water Spout
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Scald / Ice Beam
move 4: Hidden Power Grass
ability: Sniper
item: Choice Specs / Choice Scarf
evs: 236 SpA/236 Spe
nature: Timid/Modest

Moves
========

    Hydro Pump hits opponents for massive damage and is Remoraid's most effective and most powerful reliable STAB.
    Fire Blast offers fantastic coverage and great power, as well as offering a good chance to burn.
    Scald is a more reliable move than Hydro Pump, and has the great side-effect of a common burn.
    Ice Beam is again a great coverage attack.
    Hidden Power Grass, though it was nerfed this gen, still provides good coverage on many types, not least Water-types which block the entire set.


Set Details
========

    This EV spread maximizes Remoraid's speed and offensive capability. Unfortunately, the complex Level 5 EV system forces the sacrifice of 36 EVs.
    Sniper is used over Hustle because of the lack of physical attacks on this set, making it a liability rather than an asset.
    The choice of item changes this set's purpose almost entirely. A Choice Scarf allows Remoraid to outspeed and cripple most of the unboosted metagame, and Choice Specs enable it to land the OHKO on almost everything that doesn't resist its attacks.
    A Timid nature helps the pokemon to gain Speed, especially with Choice Specs, and Modest can be used for greater power, especially potent with the Choice Scarf.

Usage Tips
========

    This all-out offensive set can be used to sweep and to finish most opponents.
    It also functions well as a revenge killer.
    Remoraid is a tough pokemon to use, because of its fragility. A bulkier pokemon could also be used, but very few can hit as hard as Remoraid.
    Wish is as helpful to this set as it is to the other, because this set is even more reliant on Water Spout.

Team Options
========

    A physical attacker like Murkrow complements this set very well, because it hits the special walls Remoraid despises easily.
    Paralysis support helps Remoraid with Specs to outspeed and kill many pokemon that outspeed it naturally.
    Any Baton Pass boosts to Special Attacks are appreciated by Remoraid, as they allow Hidden Power Ground and Surf to deal more damage, not to mention Hyper Beam.
    An ally capable of Taunt helps Remoraid avoid being afflicted with status itself.
    Sticky Web is an effective support move, especially for Choice Specs because Remoraid won't be outspeeding as many enemies as it does with Choice Scarf.


Other Options
########

    Remoraid's good Speed allows it to work as a lead, but this makes Remoraid eschew some offensive power.
    A Life Orb set could be used, as it allows Remoraid to attack without being Choice-locked.
    Ice Beam is an option on either set, but it isn't nearly as effective in LC as it is in OU due to the paucity of Dragons.
    Signal Beam is another coverage option with a confusion chance.
    Thunder Wave is a good move to cripple enemies on a non-Choice set.
    Scope Lens, coupled with a use of Focus Energy, gives Remoraid a 100% chance to land a critical hit. If it can survive at full HP for one turn, it can then launch a 2.25x Water Spout, which OHKOs most of the metagame. However, Hydro Pump shoul be used most of the time for greater reliability.
    Hidden Power Fighting can be used in lieu of another move on the special set for coverage.
    A purely physical Band/Scarf set can also work, but eliminates Remoraid's usage of its best move: Water Spout.

Checks & Counters
########

**Other Scarfers**: Other pokemon with Choice Scarf can outspeed and kill Remoraid before it gets a chance to land Water Spout. They also disrupt the Choice items.

**Status**: Remoraid finds itself utterly helpless after being paralyzed, as many attackers outspeed and OHKO it.

**Substitute**: If a slower pokemon can survive one of Remoraid's attacks and get up a substitute, it can survive whatever Remoraid throws at it next and kill it. Due to Remoraid's terrible 35/35/35 defenses, not much will fail to 2HKO it.

**Faster Pokemon**: Without a Choice Scarf, Remoraid has an outspeedable 65 base Speed, and due to its awful defenses will usually take quite a bit of damage.
