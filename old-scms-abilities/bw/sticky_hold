The wielder's item cannot be removed. Increases chance of encountering Pokemon while fishing.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the enemy uses a move that would remove the wielder's item, such as <a href="/bw/moves/bug_bite>Bug Bite</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/knock_off">Knock Off</a>, it will not remove it. The wielder can still use <a href="/bw/moves/bestow">Bestow</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/trick">Trick</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/switcheroo">Switcheroo</a> normally.</p>

<p>When the wielder is first in the party, it is more likely that you will be prompted to enter battle against a wild Pokemon while fishing.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Really, this doesn't have much competitive use at all; the only real user of Sticky Hold is <a href="/bw/pokemon/muk">Muk</a> because it currently has no other viable ability, and even then you never see Muk in OU. All other Pokemon with this ability have far better abilities to make use of.</p>
