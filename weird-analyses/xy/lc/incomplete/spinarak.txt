Moves
=====

    -Sticky Web:Provides great support for offensive teams. Honestly the only reason to run Spinarak. Though most common LC Pokemon (Gligar, Misdreavus, Murkrow) are immune to it.

    -MegahornSpinarak's best STAB move.

    -Baton Pass / Toxic SpikesSpinarak has two other good support moves to use. Baton pass is good for fast offensive teams that appreciate the momentum, while Toxic Spikes greatly aids defensive teams.

    -Poison Jab / Shadow Sneak / Sucker PunchSpinarak's other attacking option. Poison Jab is great for hitting through fairies, while Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch are good since priority is important to have on your team. Shadow Sneak is more consistent, but Sucker Punch is more powerful.



Set Details
========

    -Main goal is to set up Sticky Web consistently throughout the battle. Toxic Spikes are optional but provide further support for the team
    -Insomnia is the best ability for Spinarak, considering the large amount of sleep abusers (Vulpix, Foongus, Shroomish, Gastly, etc) present in the tier.

Usage Tips
========

    -Due to Spinarak’s typing, it can easily switch in on Fighting and Grass types and use them to set up.
    -Doesn’t always have to set up at the start of the match. Make sure you have a way to deal with any Defoggers, Spinners and Pawniard.

Team Options
==========

    -Offensive pokemon who struggle with speed appreciate the Sticky Web that spinarak can set up. Bunnelby is a good partner since Spinarak can absorb any fighting attacks aimed at it, as well as being able to threaten Ghosts with Sucker Punch.

    -Pokemon who can remove Defoggers such as Gligar are very useful for Spinarak. Gothita can trap it with Shadow Tag and KO with Hidden Power Ice. Spinarak can also handle the Ghost and Dark types that scare it. Bulky water types like Staryu and Slowpoke can remove them with their STAB. Defoggers are primarily flying types, so pokemon such as Snover and Chinchou can usually outspeed and KO.

    -Pawniard is a huge threat to Sticky Web teams as it can come in and automatically double its attack. It is important to wait until Pawniard is defeated prior to setting up the webs. Having pokemon who can remove Pawniard from the field makes a good teammate for Spinarak. Fighting types are the best at this: Mienfoo, Scraggy, and Croagunk don't take much damage from Pawniard's knock off and can easily get the KO with their fighting STAB. Bulky ground types like Hippopotas and Gligar can handle Pawniard and usually heal up afterwards. Murkrow outspeeds and doesn't mind Sucker Punch, while being able to KO with Heat Wave.


Other Options
==========

    -Spinarak gets access to Infestation, which it can use to trap Grass and Fighting types allowing it set up easier. However this is unreliable as Spinarak forces switches easily.
    -It can pass Hone Claws or Agility to give it or a partner more power.
    -Spinarak can disable an enemies move to help it or another pokemon to easily take down that pokemon.

Checks & Counters
==============

    -Gligar laughs at both of Spinarak’s STABs and can defog the hazards away or set up its deadly Swords Dance set.
    -In general, almost all Fire, Rock, Flying, and Psychic types can make quick work of Spinarak before it has time to set up or baton pass.
    -It hates Stealth Rock, so it can’t handle repeated switches.
    -Taunt users completely shut it down. Common tanut users include Misdreavus, Mienfoo, Cottonee, Aipom, Croagunk, Gothita, Houndour, Murkrow and Vullaby. That latter three can easily remove Spinarak with their STAB as well.
    -Multi-hit move abusers, such as Shellder and Dwebble can hit through Spinarak's focus sash, especially considering they both have access to Rock Blast.
    Natu, being the only Magic Bounce user in LC, can defect Spinarak's hazards right back at it and can threaten to KO with its Super-Effective STABS.
