<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>So, it's time for me to post a rate my team. I was browsing through some topics on Stark Mountain, where I came across a topic from Colonel M promoting the use of SubRhyperior. I thought it would probably be a good idea trying out a team with Rhyperior in it. I thought long and hard on how to promote this team to the fullest using Pokemon that I liked (since I like to build teams like that) and Pokemon that also work. Seeing this set made me realise how underestimated and destructive Rhyperior is and how effective it can work in OU play, especially with Sandstorm in play. Awesome defences + great HP + phenomenal offensive properties = one heck of a Pokemon. </p>

<p>Now, at a glance, you may notice that the team is pretty slow, though this is a disadvantage, this team still works out together with status, defensive properties and "picking off" opponents thanks to Scizor in particular.</p>

<p>This team is meant to promote Rhyperior in a way by eliminating it's counters and general counters and possible threats so that Rhyperior can come in, get a Sub up and commence sweeping wherever possible. This team is currently on a good record on the Smogon server.</p>

<p>I called this team "Su(b)perior Democracy" because it's a team with SubRhyperior in it, and my mate just brought "Chinese Democracy", lol. </p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/455.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Hippowdon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 236 HP / 24 Atk / 192 Def / 58 SpD<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Fang<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Slack Off</p>

<p>Hippowdon is my lead. It's been quite and effective one at that, too. Getting Stealth Rock and Sandstorm up as soon as possible is obligatory and also negates the effects of Focus Sash which could otherwise be a pain in the backside with sacrificing and stuff with certain Sashers. </p>

<p>With Tyranitar being a problem when Scizor is down in particular, I needed to have something which could both: a) take down Tyranitar and b) take on most Physical threats effectively. Hippowdon can do both. Ice Fang's demand since Garchomp was banned isn't as great, but it still comes in handy with Salamences and Flygons. Having a good recovery move is also helpful. </p>

<p>The EVs allow me to maximizes HP and defensive capabilities. 236 HP allow me to hit a stat of 416, a leftovers number. With 192 Def my Defensiveness are pretty decent. 24 atk allow me to be guarantees at least a 2HKO on Flygon and a definate 2HKO on Salamence after Intimidate and Stealth Rock / Life Orb / Sand storm have taken effect. The leftover EVs are dumped straight in SDef so Hippowdon is capable of taking random Hidden Powers.</p>

<p><strong>Blissey</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 84 HP / 252 Def / 40 SpA / 134 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Softboiled</p>

<p>Blissey. Probably the most reliable Special wall ever. Since my team couldn't really handle Special attackers without this, it needed to be incorporated. Most Blisseys would carry 252 HP / 252 Def as their spread, but since I'm wanting it to fulfill it's duty as a Special Wall, I had to invest and enormous amount of SDef EVs so I could take on those SpecsJolteons, etcetera. Ice Beam is there for Gengars since I can't hit them with Seismic Toss, and for those SpecsMences. Dugtrio is 2HKO'd by Ice Beam on switch with Stealth Rock up on the switch, so it takes care of that too. Toxic is for those Zapdos' and Rest-lacking CMCunes who try to set up otherwise. Since I can't OHKO them with either attacking moves, Toxic is a great move which helps. Also helps with Statusing those Physical switch-ins. Seismic Toss allows me to break those Subs of Special attackers.</p>

<p>Since I sacrificed a significant amount of EVs into both defences, I was left with some EVs I could play around with also. 84 HP gives me 672 HP, which, if you divide by 16, gives you a leftovers number (similar concept to Hippowdon's distribution of HP EVs) - that number being 42. As previously mentioned, 40 SAtk allows me to 2HKO Dugtrio on the switch with Stealth Rock damage since Earthquake shouldn't OHKO Blissey; OHKO Salamence (in particular SpecsMence) on switch after Stealth Rock damage, and 2HKOs 252 HP / 220 Def / 36 Spe Zapdos after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>Having Natural Cure, Blissey can walk into those Status inflicting moves such as Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, which would otherwise harm the rest of my team and in particular, Rhyperior. I'm thinking of changing this to either the Cleric variant of Blissey since switching Blissey in and out gets predictable and can be a pain. I'm also thinking of changing the current Blissey for a WishBliss giving Rhyperior and Scizor surivivability. Why I haven't done so already is simple: most of the times I don't need to pass Wish onto Rhyperior / Scizor and other Pokemon already have recovery moves of their own. This does not rule out the possible implementation of WishBliss, however.</p>

<p><strong>Slowbro</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Own Tempo<br />
EVs: 212 HP / 252 Def / 44 SpA<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Slack Off<br />
- Surf<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Hidden Power Electric / Grass Knot</p>

<p>Oh. My. Goodness. Yadoran. I cannot express how happy I am to see this guy on my team - I've always looked for a place to put this on other teams, though that's not been possible. Until now. I would also like to say thanks to Elevator Music for letting people know how great Slowbro is. </p>

<p>Well, onto the Analysis. Slowbro is my Gyarados, Machamp, Heatran, and MixApe counter. Surf OHKOs Infernape and Heatran and Hidden Power [Electric] 2HKOs Gyarados. Thanks to Slowbro's resistance to DynamicPunch + it's immunity to the confusion side-effect, Slowbro makes the perfect Machamp counter, 3HKOing it with Surf whilst Machamp's next best bet, Stone Edge, is 4HKO without Stealth Rock or 3HKO with Stealth Rock, but Slack off can always help regain health so that's not really much of a problem. </p>

<p>Slowbro is a great status inflicter, spamming Thunder Wave around like nothing at all. Damaging incoming Zapdos' and sometimes the odd Gengar switch-in. </p>

<p>I'm currently thinking about replacing Hidden Power [Electric] with Grass Knot because it has suddenly caught my attention that I have issues with ResTalk Curse Swamperts. Yes, I can use Roar to phaze the status increases, but can't do much in the meantime. Grass Knot still gives me the 2HKO that Hidden Power [Electric] would on Gyarados, and sort out the issue of countering Swamperts. So it is certainly a possibility. At the moment, I'm testing it out.</p>

<p>As long as Slowbro carries Grass knot, I can also deal with a threat to Rhyperior: Swampert.</p>

<p>The EVs in HP give me a stat of 384, which, if you divide by 16 gives me another leftovers recovery number of 24. With the addition of maxed Defence, defences are maximized. The remainder EVs were added to SAtk so I can 2HKO Gyarados after SR damage.</p>

<p><strong>Zapdos</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 80 SpA / 176 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Heat Wave<br />
- Roost<br />
- Roar / Hidden Power Grass<br />
- Thunderbolt</p>

<p>Zapdos. A vital member of my team and probably the Pokemon I rely on the most to bring a good and clean sweep with Rhyperior - being the main counter to most of Rhyperior's own counters. Since I don't have a Rapid Spinner, and Zapdos is my only Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon, I figured Roost would be a good move to give Zapdos. But it's still good as a general recovery move. Zapdos is also my Phazer with Roar, since my team is otherwise easily set up on. Zapdos servers as my main Lucario, non-scarfed Heracross, Bronzong, Celebi, Breloom, Torterra, Skarmory, Forretress and [insert Bulky Water] counter. From that list alone, you can tell that without it, holes are shown. If it wasn't for Zapdos, I'd probably have dificulty taking down the aforementioned Pokemon. </p>

<p>Celebi, Torterra, Breloom, Bronzong, and Skarmory are particular counters to Rhyperior. Thanks to Heat Wave in particular, these are no longer major threats since Zapdos outspeeds the standard sets of these Pokemon.</p>

<p>With the given EVs, Zapdos is both Bulky and offensive: maximizing HP and having enough Spd to outspeed Adamant / Modest Lucario and Adamant Heracross to name the least. The remaining EVs going into SAtk to back up Zapdos' chances of OHKOing the mentioned threats to the team and other Pokemon in general.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/212.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Superpower</p>

<p>Scizor. My main revenge killer, Psychic / Ghost trapper and scouter. At first, I was a bit reluctant to implement CBScizor into this team > SD Scizor. Now I know it was a good decision. Being able to pick-off foes with Bullet Punch is amazing, with the additional STAB, Technician boost, and Choice Band boost, it's a force to be reckoned with. Salamence being OHKO'd by Bullet Punch if ever Hippowdon is dead after Stealth Rock damage; Mamoswine being OHKO'd by Bullet Punch, general Ice Pokemon, too. This goes for frail, faster foes too, such as Azelf and Gengar who are killed by Bullet Punch, or if I predict a switch because they are at moderate health, by Pursuit. It's also good to Pursuit the lights of fleeing Celebi and Cresselias and Blisseys who are never mad enough to stay in fearing Brick Break or Superpower. Brick Break is for those steel types like Magnezone and Heatran who try to come in on me. It also helps break those annoying Reflect / Light Screens. U-turn, naturally, gives me the element of scouting as well as damaging my opponent at the same time. Helpful for getting out of those tight situations and allows me to switch to an appropriate counter. STABbed, Choice Banded U-Turn hurts foes alot. A great Pokemon who supports this team well.</p>

<p>EVs give me the "all-out" approach: maximzing Attack for power and speed for outspeeding Tyranitar and standard Magnezone. If it dare stay in.</p>

<p><strong>Rhyperior</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Solid Rock<br />
EVs: 132 HP / 192 Atk / 16 Def / 168 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>The Rock of the Show: Rhyperior. I must thank Colonel M for this set next time we battle. This thing is seriously underestimated because of it's weaknesses. Sandstorm's SDef increase + Substitute + 404 HP + 400 Atk + great defence + Solid Rock (which, if you didn't know, reduces the damage of super effective moves from x2 to x1.5) = epicness. Switch this into Blissey and Sub up could mean Good game. Blissey, if it was mad enough, wouldn't even be able to break This beast's Subs with Seismic Toss or Ice Beam. Substitute and Swords Dance is a lethal combination, for if Substitute is up and an SD is done, Rhyperior reaches a massive 800 attack stat! With the speed allowing Rhyperior to outmanuver Swampert (a major counter to Rhyperior) who is OHKO'd by Earthquake. Machamp is OHKO'd and so is Porygon2, by Eathquake. In some games, putting this in has meant Good game and has brought me many 6-0s and 5-0s. Earthquake is a great move already, but with Stone Edge hitting Flyers, things just keep on getting better with great coverage given between the two moves. </p>

<p>Just so you know what this guy is capable of, here are a few facts (produced by Colonel M):</p>

<p>Timid Heatran's Earth Power is a 3HKO</p>
<p>Zapdos Hidden Power Ice won't 2HKO Rhyperior (with Life Orb)</p>
<p>Blissey's Ice Beam won't break the Substitute (as well as Seismic Toss)</p>
<p>Bronzong and Forretress's Gyro Ball won't break the Substitute</p>
<p>Cresselia can only break it with Grass Knot (which is extremely uncommon)</p>
<p>Physical Jirachi that lack Iron Head are walled by this beast.</p>
<p>Salamence Earthquake is a 2HKO at best</p>
<p>Scizor won't OHKO with Bullet Punch</p>
<p>Gliscor Earthquake won't 2HKO</p>

<p>So, as you can see, the EVs play a major part in the success of this beast.</p>
