It does not alert the Pokémon to OHKO moves that cannot hit it. It also informs this Pokemon of moves that do typeless damage but are listed as having a type if that listed type would be super effective: Beat Up, Doom Desire, and Future Sight all give a message. The message will not tell what the move is. It does not inform the Pokémon of super effective Counter, Hidden Power, Judgment, Metal Burst, Mirror Coat, Natural Gift, or Weather Ball.</p>

<p>If a Pokémon activates Anticipation, that Pokémon cannot use it again until it leaves play, even if it loses and re-gains Anticipation through Skill Swap. If a Pokémon acquires Anticipation through Skill Swap or Role Play, it will immediately activate.</p>
