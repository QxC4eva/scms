<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Little Cup, circa June 2011. The metagame revolved almost  entirely around Gligar, Misdreavus, Meditite, and Carvanha. These  tyrants dominated, and if you didn't prepare for them properly, you  would be crushed like the LC-playing noob you probably are. Even if you  opted not to use these insanely powerful beasts, chances are you would  still be seeing quite a bit of them, as they were seemingly on over  two-thirds of teams. Their iron-clad grip on the metagame prevented  other popular cutemons from being effective or usable, making the tier  dull and almost lifeless. Having had enough, an elite team of Little Cup  players got together, and after minor deliberation, the group voted to  banish all 4 of the menacing Pokemon to the realm of Little Cup Ubers, a  metagame so barren, desolate, and utterly gimmicky not even Theorymon  would dare to touch it.</p>

<p>Were things really that bad? Probably not. Was it wise to ban 4  Pokemon at once? Definitely not, and there were members of the group  that felt that way, but they were outvoted.</p>

<p>While it may seem crazy to see the top 4 Pokemon banned from  any tier, the problem is magnified in LC, because the popular Pokemon  get a lot more usage than top Pokemon in other tiers do (sometimes up to  60% or more!). While you may be thinking, "What's the point? All my  favorite Pokemon have been purged...", don't despair, because we're here  to show you what is still great in LC and what has risen from the  ashes. New Pokemon that you perhaps would never have even thought of  have come up from the depths of Little Cup, and now it is their turn to  shine. While some of the changes might be fairly extravagant, I can't  promise too much; no Magikarp sweeps are coming in the near future  though!</p>

<h2>What's new? </h2>

<h3>Scraggy</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/589.png" alt="" /><br />
Scraggy (M) @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Shed Skin<br />
EVs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 212 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Drain Punch / Zen Headbutt<br />
- Hi Jump Kick</p>

<p>Scraggy? Nothing new here, right? Wrong. It's common knowledge  that Scraggy is one of the most dangerous sweepers in LC, capable of  tearing through unprepared teams after a single Dragon Dance. That was  true during the period before the bans, and is still true now. However,  the bans have been a great boon for Scraggy. With Meditite out of the  way, you have one less counter to worry about when running the little  lizard, and with Gligar gone, you're free to run whatever you want in  the last moveslot instead of Ice Punch. But the icing on the cake is  that Scraggy can now use Hi Jump Kick to OHKO Timburr and Mienfoo after a  single Dragon Dance! This is great news for Scraggy, because most of  its solid counters are now out of the picture. Scaggy can also run Zen  Headbutt for pesky Croagunks, but having Hi Jump Kick as its only  Fighting-type attack is unreliable, as its negative drawbacks can be  easily exploited.</p>

<h3>Croagunk</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/458.png" alt="" /><br />
Croagunk (M) @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Dry Skin<br />
EVs: 52 HP / 188 Atk / 116 Def / 116 SpD / 36 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Fake Out<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Payback / Toxic</p>

<p>Did I say all of Scraggy's counters were out of the picture?  Well I meant all except for Croagunk. Croagunk really benefited from the  bans, because it had trouble dealing with Meditite, Gligar, and  Misdreavus (it was actually one of the few Pokemon that countered  Carvanha, though). Croagunk is also one of the most solid Scraggy checks  thanks to its unique typing and bulk with Eviolite. Versions running  Zen Headbutt might be rare, but they will lead Croagunk to a bitter end.  Its Dry Skin ability can really come in useful when dealing with things  like Clamperl, and double priority is very useful for finishing off  sweepers such as Drilbur, Taillow, and the aforementioned clam. Croagunk  struggles against certain Pokemon like Hippopotas and Slowpoke (which  can be crippled by Toxic), but if you have a check for those, then you  should definitely give Croagunk a try!</p>

<h3>Shelmet</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/646.png" alt="" /><br />
Shelmet (M) @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Shell Armor<br />
EVs: 116 HP / 236 Def / 156 SpD<br />
Calm Nature (+SpD, -Atk)<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Recover<br />
- Acid Armor / Yawn<br />
- Bug Buzz</p>

<p>Did I say all of Scraggy's counters were out of the pic—wait, I  already used that. Well in any case, Shelmet is one of the more  reliable Scraggy counters in the new metagame. In the previous metagame,  Shelmet struggled, as it was setup bait for both Gligar and Misdreavus,  and Carvanha was a huge threat to it as well. It was generally  outclassed as a tank, and both Ferroseed and Dwebble were superior at  setting up Spikes. However, now that 3 big threats to it are gone, it  makes a fantastic choice in a metagame filled with Fighting-types. With  Acid Armor, Recover, and Shell Armor, it is virtually impossible for  Scraggy and other Fighting-types such as Timburr to break through, while  Scraggy can set up Spikes or just wear them down with Bug Buzz. It's  fairly important to keep Stealth Rock off the field, but with the help  of a spinner, that's a fairly easy task. You also get extra cute points  for using it, because.... well look at it!</p>

<h3>Taillow</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/276.png" alt="" /><br />
Taillow (M) @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Guts<br />
EVs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 236 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Brave Bird<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Quick Attack</p>

<p>Taillow is as dangerous as it is adorable. Reaching a blazing  28 Speed with a Choice Scarf, there aren't many Pokemon that Taillow  can't revenge kill. One merit that Taillow has is the ability to revenge  kill Scraggy after a Dragon Dance, which can otherwise be a royal pain in the  ass. Taillow's revenge killing capabilities aren't limited to Scraggy  though. There aren't many Pokemon that can take a STAB Brave Bird, and  for those that can, a simple U-turn is the solution. If the opposing  team is loaded with Magnemite, Slowpoke, and Hippopotas, you'll find  yourself U-turning more than using Brave Bird, so a solution to those  Pokemon is advised. Taillow's last two moves really are filler moves,  and probably won't see much use. That doesn't mean they are useless,  though. Pursuit can be useful for catching a fleeing Gastly off-guard,  aided by Taillow's Ghost-type immunity which allows it to switch in with  ease. Quick Attack is weak priority, and isn't very useful, although I  can't tell you how many times I've finished off a Drilbur at low health  with Quick Attack and won the match in a hilarious manner!</p>

<p>Some people say that two heads are better than one, and might  prefer to use Doduo. Can't argue with them, really; Doduo plays a very  similar role to Taillow, but has a much higher Attack stat. Doduo  doesn't have U-turn in its arsenal and is slightly slower at 18 Speed  though, which gives Taillow an edge. However, if you're looking for a  stronger revenge killer with a bit more peck, then Doduo is your  bird(s).</p>

<h3>Abra</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/63.png" alt="" /><br />
Abra (M) @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Magic Guard<br />
EVs: 240 SpA / 200 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting<br />
- Shadow Ball / Taunt<br />
- Encore</p>

<p>Um...... Abra? Seriously? What's it gonna do? Teleport at me?  Abra has always been awful, its great Speed and Special Attack being  held back by possibly the most awful defenses ever, which is worse in LC  with the ubiquity of powerful priority. Of late, however, Abra has  taken a turn for the better; Meditite and Carvanha are out of the  picture, both of which can OHKO it with priority, and the latter having  Speed Boost. It has also received probably one of the best abilities  from the Dream World—Magic Guard. With Magic Guard, Abra is a force to  be reckoned with! Now, you're looking at a Pokemon with 19 Speed and 20  Special Attack that takes no damage from entry hazards, Life Orb recoil,  or weather. Pretty scary huh? Abra is still as weak as a bad pun, but  if it gets a chance to safely switch in, you're in trouble, because  you'll need something to outspeed it, or something that can take  multiple hits from it. I bet you regret laughing at Teleport  now.....</p>

<div style="float: right;">
<p><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue18/whatsnewlc_larvesta.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>

<h3>Larvesta</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/666.png" alt="" /><br />
Larvesta (M) @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Flame Body<br />
EVs: 236 HP / 156 Def / 116 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Morning Sun<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- Will-O-Wisp<br />
- U-turn</p>

<p>In a metagame where Mienfoo is in almost every battle, Eviolite  Larvesta might just be the ultimate troll. Not only does it completely  wall almost every Mienfoo set (as well as every other common  Fighting-type), but thanks to Flame Body, Mienfoo will even be paranoid  about spamming Fake Out and U-turn, lest they risk being permanently  crippled by a burn. In the meantime, Larvesta can fire off Flare Blitz  or spam U-turn itself. Larvesta couldn't really operate well in the  previous metagame, as Gligar would destroy it with Acrobatics or Stone  Edge, and Carvanha could just OHKO it quickly with a powerful Hydro  Pump, but it works well now as a great Fighting-type resist on more  balanced and offensive teams... provided you can keep Stealth Rock off  the field, that is. It also has Morning Sun, so its 4x Stealth Rock  weakness isn't as crippling as it sounds.</p>

<h3>Drilbur</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/557.png" alt="" /><br />
Drilbur (M) @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Sand Rush<br />
EVs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 212 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Rock Slide / Shadow Claw<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>Nothing new here, although Drilbur functions a lot more  comfortably post-bannings. Meditite had a combination of Fake Out +  Bullet Punch, Carvanha had Aqua Jet, and Gligar could take any of  Drilbur's attacks (barring Hidden Power Ice). The only new thing for  Drilbur is that it doesn't have to run Hidden Power Ice to beat pesky  Gligars anymore, and thus has a free moveslot. If you want to know what  Drilbur is like in LC, picture Excadrill in OU without Skarmory and  Gliscor, with less weather wars! Ok, maybe it's not THAT bad... Drilbur  doesn't have the great typing that Excadrill has, and is either too weak  with an Eviolite or too fragile with a Life Orb. Pokemon like Slowpoke,  Wooper, and Koffing can beat it one-on-one, while most Pokemon with  priority can finish it off at low HP. While Drilbur is a great Pokemon,  it isn't broken, and unlike its older brother, it (hopefully) won't be  banned anytime soon.</p>

<h3>Exeggcute</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/102.png" alt="" /><br />
Exeggcute (M) @ Oran Berry<br />
Ability: Harvest<br />
EVs: 36 HP / 36 Def / 196 SpA / 36 SpD / 196 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Leaf Storm<br />
- Psychic</p>

<p>Exeggcute was a powerful force during the Drought days, but  after Vulpix said goodbye to LC, it became pretty much dormant. And  then, as with most Pokemon in this article, Exeggcute suddenly became  viable after the big 4 were banned, although it is possibly the only  Pokemon that lost to all of them. It's a bit difficult to pinpoint what  this set actually does, but I guess you could say that it makes use of  Exeggcute's best traits. Sleep Powder can effectively put one Pokemon on  the opposing team out of action, and when isn't that going to be  useful? Substitute lets Exeggcute stay safe as it attacks, which is  cool, when considering that Exeggcute is quite slow, and can be easily  revenge killed. Substitute also lets Exeggcute take advantage of  Harvest, which is another unique trait that it has. Exeggcute has quite  good coverage with its dual STAB, and can pack a punch if it puts  opposing Steel-types / Houndour to sleep with Sleep Powder. Exeggcute  can also make a cool Sunny Day sweeper, but without Drought and with  Hippopotas being so popular, that probably isn't the best  idea.</p>

<h3>Gastly</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/92.png" alt="" /><br />
Gastly (M) @ Oran Berry / Life Orb<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 36 HP / 40 Def / 200 SpA / 200 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Hypnosis<br />
- Sludge Bomb<br />
- Shadow Ball</p>

<p>Gastly has been lurking in the shadows, reminiscing of the  times that people actually used it in early BW LC thanks to the  introduction of Eviolite. The big 4 weren't that kind to it either. It  couldn't safely switch into Meditite, fearing Zen Headbutt, Gligar just  narrowly outpaced it, Carvanha walked all over it with Speed Boost and  Crunch, and let's face it, Misdreavus just plain outclassed it... But  now that they've all been banned, Gastly must feel like it won the  lottery! Gastly's strategy is to set up a Substitute when it can, and  then fire off powerful attacks at whatever switches into it. Pokemon  such as Munchlax give it a hard time, and Gastly's only hope of beating  it is putting it to sleep with Hypnosis. Sludge Bomb is a great  secondary STAB—something that Misdreavus never had—which allows Gastly  to hit Pokemon that resist Shadow Ball hard, without having to resort to  using weaker attacks. Gastly is once again the king of the LC  Ghost-types, filling the shoes of Misdreavus. I mean, what else are you  going to use? Drifloon?.....</p>

<div style="float: right;">
<p><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue18/whatsnewlc_drifloon.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>

<h3>Drifloon</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/430.png" alt="" /><br />
Drifloon (M) @ Flying Gem<br />
Ability: Aftermath<br />
EVs: 196 Atk / 116 SpA / 196 Spe<br />
Naughty Nature (+Atk, -SpD)<br />
- Acrobatics<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Explosion</p>

<p>No, this isn't a joke. Drifloon sort of shot up out of nowhere,  reaching a staggering #9 on the LC usage statistics! Before you laugh,  just think: what would you send in against a Drifloon with 32 Speed and a  110 Base Power STAB attack, backed up by awesome coverage? Yeah, maybe  Drifloon's not so funny anymore.... The only things that can safely  switch into it are Steel-types that don't take too much damage from  Hidden Power Fire, namely Aron in sandstorm. Sucker Punch from Croagunk  or Houndour will pop Drifloon, although not much else will.... It's a  bit strange that this set didn't see usage beforehand, though, as it  fares well against the big 4. I guess it was just a hidden gem that  hadn't yet been discovered.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, as you can see, LC is far from a barren wasteland, and has  actually increased in variety since those 4 great Pokemon were banished.  Now's a better time than ever to build a team and play some LC! Who  knows what the future might hold? Who knows what will be banned next, if  anything? The only way to find out is to simply get out there and play!  Still, no Magikarp sweeps any time soon...</p>
