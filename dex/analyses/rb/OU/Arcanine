[Overview]

<p>With its good stats and terrible movepool, Arcanine has the same problem as many other Fire-types. It can do some damage and work alright as a surprise lead, but it is easily countered.</p>

[SET]
name: Anti-Lead
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Body Slam
move 3: Hyper Beam / Mimic
move 4: Reflect

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This works decently as a lead because it immediately threatens common sleep leads such as Jynx, Exeggutor, and Venusaur. Body Slam is good for spreading paralysis as your opponent switches. Hyper Beam works well with Arcanine's high Attack, while Mimic, the more recommendable option, can occasionally help it with its limited movepool. Reflect is nice to give it more staying power, even if it still has to run away from threats such as Rhydon and Golem.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Agility is fine if Arcanine gets paralyzed, but usually there's not much time to use it. Flamethrower can be used if you don't like the accuracy of Fire Blast, but Fire Blast should work better overall because it has more power, which is necessary due to Arcanine's mediocre Special. Arcanine could use Dig, but it probably won't work unless your opponent is lacking options after a few of their Pokemon have been taken down, as it's very predictable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Arcanine will fall to Rhydon and Golem, but getting a burn on them is nice. If it still has enough health when that happens, you can switch out and save Arcanine for later. If it gets a Reflect in, it is possible to beat Tauros, with some luck of course, but luck doesn't occur too often against Tauros. Surfing Starmie will also get rid of Arcanine, as will Lapras (and for what it's worth, any STAB Surf will pack a punch). Many Pokemon can also switch in fairly comfortably, including Snorlax and Dragonite. The former has very high HP, while the latter has a nice resistance to Fire-type attacks.</p>
