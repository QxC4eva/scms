<p>Having a French database for strategic purposes is an idea that has been lurking in our heads for a while (several months, at least). Having an idea is a good thing, applying it is much harder.  This page is here for people to know who is behind this work. Glad them, slap them, ignore them, but do something for them. They deserve it. The amount of work is pretty impressive because ripping-off an article isn't enough when you need to translate it ; anyone older than 12 knows this. That's why we're proud to show you the translating team and the people supporting it :</p>

<h2>Head of the Project</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=38677">Agammemnon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The guy who launched the French Project. He gathered volunteers and participates himself in the translation/grammar check/html processes. He's also the go-between French Project and Smogon. He's also in charge of the cache-ing part.</p>

<h2>Special Contributor</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=38766">Maaf</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This guy needs a gold medal. He's the administrator of the PO server known as French Time, and he also hosts the forum for the French Project. (The forum where we deposit articles needing to be grammar-checked). He's a dedicated member of our sub-community and he's translated, grammar-checked and HTMLized so much articles that you won't be able to read them in a lifetime. Without him the project might have been reported or even aborted. Thank you, sir.

<h2>Artist</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=91574">Eustatic</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We absolutely needed an artist to have a logo. Eustatic took the job, granting us with a wonderful picture for the main page ! He's also a HTML pro, allowing us to rectify inevitable mistakes. 

<h2>Contributors</h2>

<li><a href="/forums/member.php?u=93128">Mynism</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Such a long list for those awesome people. They'd each deserve a dedicated page but we can't afford it so I'll try to cover them with honor as much as this format allows me to.</p>
<p>giara, Yoko are names that you probably never heard of, but they're still some cool people (!). They provide quality work and their company is always enjoyable. Tempesstt and H-C are somewhat new members to the Smogon community but they're motivated and allow the project to keep going on. Thanks guys. And then come Aqualouis and Mynism ; besides being well-known competitive players, they also involve themselves in a community project. How awesome ! Thanks a lot to all of you guys.</p>

<p>Best. Admin. Ever. This guy allowed to project to be launched in an official manner. He also granted one of our members access to the cached part of Smogon in order to accelerate the uploading process. He also made the cache-ing process far more easy and explained us a ton of things. SWISS KNIFE INDEED. Dear Articuno64 we are eternally thankful.</p>

<p>Mr. John himself.</p>

<h2>And then</h2>
<p> Thanks to all our supporters, readers ! Without you, we'd be nothing :)</p>
