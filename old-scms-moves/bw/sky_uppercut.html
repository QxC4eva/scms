[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. This move can hit a target using Bounce, Fly, or Sky Drop. Damage is boosted to 1.2x by the ability Iron Fist</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Since Fly and Bounce see next to no competitive use, the ability to hit a Pokemon in the invulnerable stage of those moves can be ignored. Sky Uppercut is also nearly outclassed on almost all Pokemon that receive it. Breloom has access to Drain Punch and Mach Punch, Lucario has access to both Close Combat and Hi Jump Kick, Hitmonchan has access to Close Combat, Drain Punch, and Mach Punch, and so on. Combusken and Blaziken are two notable exceptions. Combusken's movepool is quite shallow, so Sky Uppercut is a huge blessing for it. Blaziken usually uses Hi Jump Kick over Sky Uppercut in Uber; however, VGC is a different story. Protect is common in VGC 2012, which makes Hi Jump Kick extremely dangerous to use. Therefore, most trainers decide to use Sky Uppercut instead.</p>
