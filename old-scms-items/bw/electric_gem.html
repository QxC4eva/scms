<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder uses a damage-dealing Electric-type move, then the holder consumes this item and the power of that move is increased by 50%. One-time use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In single battles, Electric Gem is not typically a useful item, unfortunately. While the one-time boost to Electric-type attacks is nice, most Pokemon using Electric-type attacks would rather have the more reliable power of Life Orb or Choice items.</p>

<p>Typically Gems are more valuable in the VGC and similar environments, and Electric Gem is often used here to boost the power of Electric-type attacks such as Thunderbolt from Pokemon such as Thundurus and Magnezone. The one-time power boost can come in very useful in such a fast-paced metagame, particularly against specially defensive Pokemon, such as Togekiss and Jellicent, without any drawbacks. In addition, it can be used to increase the power of a first-turn Discharge.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Occur randomly in Dust Clouds.</p>
