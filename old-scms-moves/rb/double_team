<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's evasion stat by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Double Team is a banned move from the competitive scene. It breaks the Evasion Clause that is generically applied to all Smogon battles. It was considered unhealthy for a skill-based metagame, since it rewards luck instead of skill, while taking the battle from both players' control and making the game (even more) luck based. It often created situations where the crucial miss changed the outcome of a match. For these reasons it is never seen in this competitive environment.</p>
