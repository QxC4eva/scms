Overview
########

Thanks to its ability, Pure Power, which doubles its otherwise average Attack stat, Meditite is one of the most powerful physical attackers in Little Cup. To complement this, Meditite has a large physical movepool, giving it good coverage in the elemental punches, and priority in Fake Out and Bullet Punch. Although Meditite is powerful, it does have some downsides. Its Speed leaves it prone to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Gligar, Misdreavus, and Murkrow, and there are many bulky walls that resist Fighting-type moves such as Spritzee and Slowpoke.

Eviolite
########
name: Eviolite
move 1: Drain Punch
move 2: Fake Out
move 3: Bullet Punch
move 4: Zen Headbutt / Ice Punch / Thunder Punch
ability: Pure Power
item: Eviolite
evs: 196 Atk / 156 Def / 156 SDef
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

With an Eviolite, Meditite can be a good bulky attacker that can easily dent holes in the opposing team. Drain Punch should be used the most, as it is not only a reliable STAB, but it is also Meditite's only way of staying healthy throughout the match. Fake Out allows Meditite to function as a revenge killer, removing Dwebble and Tirtouga's Sturdy and providing chip damage against faster threats such as Swirlix. Bullet Punch is Meditite's other priority move, and with the help of Fake Out, it can revenge kill many weakened sweepers. The last slot comes down to a choice between Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch, and Thunder Punch, the choice of which usually depends on what the rest of your team can handle. If you're not running Zen Headbutt, Poison-types and Misdreavus will be able to wall you. Ice Punch is used to hit Gligar switch-ins, whilst Thunder Punch has a 64% chance of 2HKOing Slowpoke. Alternatively, you can forgo one, or even both priority moves for extra coverage.

Set Details
========

The EVs max out Meditite's Attack stat in order to make sure it hits as hard as possible, with the rest placed in its defenses. With an Eviolite, Meditite has 21 in each defensive stat, allowing it to take hits such as Gligar's Acrobatics before its Berry Juice is consumed and Misdreavus's Shadow Ball. Alternatively, a faster EV spread can be used, as maximizing Speed allows it to speed tie with Jolly Pawniard. However, the use of Eviolite means that this set is better off focusing on taking hits.

Usage Tips
========

Meditite's primary purpose is to be used as a bulky pivot that can punch holes in many common threats. With its unique typing, it can switch into most Normal-, Fighting-, Rock-, Poison-, and Steel-types and can hit them with super effective moves, or predict incoming switch-ins to hit with a coverage move. It must be wary of switching into Pokemon such as Porygon and Munchlax that can paralyze it as it switches in, or Koffing, which often carries Will-O-Wisp. Meditite's reasonable bulk and high Attack allow it to check many of the tier's most threatening set-up sweepers, such as Carvanha, Tirtouga, Dwebble, and Swirlix.

Team Options
========

Meditite really appreciates something that can switch into faster Flying-types such as Gligar, Murkrow, and Fletchling. Archen and Magnemite are great for this, and they can also provide Meditite with opportunities to switch in with U-turn or Volt Switch. Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull also give Meditite some trouble, so Steel- and Poison-types make good partners. Pawniard is good at fulfilling this role and supporting Meditite with Knock Off, and it likes Meditite's ability to switch into Fighting-types. Pokemon that can switch into Ghost-type moves from Misdreavus and Gastly make for good teammates; Porygon and Munchlax are prime examples and can support Meditite with Thunder Wave and Body Slam, respectively. Fairy-types such as Swirlix like the fact that Meditite can remove Poison-types for them, which can open up the opportunity for a late-game sweep. Finally an interesting partner is Torchic, which can Baton Pass boosts from Swords Dance and Speed Boost, turning Meditite into a formidable sweeper.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Drain Punch / High Jump Kick
move 2: Bullet Punch
move 3: Fake Out
move 4: Zen Headbutt / Ice Punch / Thunder Punch
ability: Pure Power
item: Life Orb
evs: 196 Atk / 76 Def / 196 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

This set aims to hit as hard as possible with its Life Orb-boosted attacks. Drain Punch is the STAB move of choice, hitting hard and recovering health to keep Meditite healthy. High Jump Kick is a risky alternative, but is one of the most powerful moves in the tier, dealing massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Bullet Punch and Fake Out offer the priority that Meditite needs to revenge kill weakened threats. The combination of the two gives Meditite the ability to revenge kill some of the most threatening set-up sweepers in the tier, such as Dwebble and Swirlix, as well as many other weakened opponents. Zen Headbutt is an option for the final slot, and it gives Meditite a more reliable STAB move if it's running High Jump Kick. Ice Punch and Thunder Punch can be used instead for extra coverage, hitting Flying-type switch-ins. Ice Punch is best if you can predict a Gligar switching in, but Thunder Punch is also a good option as it gives Meditite the ability to 2HKO Slowpoke.

Set Details
========

The EV spread for this set is very simple, investing in Speed and Attack, with an extra point put into Defense. An Adamant is used as it lets Meditite 2HKO Spritzee, while a Jolly nature doesn't let Meditite outspeed anything too notable. It is an option, however, if you want to speed tie with Jolly Pawniard, and max Speed neutral-natured Mienfoo and Chinchou. As the item used is a Life Orb, no extra EVs should go into Meditite's HP, as Meditite hits the crucial 19 HP stat, meaning that it only loses 1 HP to recoil instead of 2.

Usage Tips
========

Because Life Orb Meditite is much frailer than Eviolite Meditite, it cannot switch in nearly as well. Due to this, it should be used as more of a hit-and-run Pokemon as many things will be able to revenge kill it. Once Meditite is in safely, it can threaten most of the tier with its powerful moves. It often relies on prediction in order to hit Pokemon switching in, but this allows it to 2HKO Spritzee with Zen Headbutt, 2HKO Slowpoke with Thunder Punch, and OHKO Gligar with Ice Punch. For this reason it should be noted that Meditite should not overuse Fake Out as this will give the opponent a much easier time switching in. Meditite is a great revenge killer as it can deal serious damage to anything slower than it and can take down faster threats with its priority.

Team Options
========

Meditite works well on balanced teams that need something to hit hard and break down defensive cores. Late-game sweepers, such as Scraggy, Tirtouga, and Gligar love Meditite's ability to soften the opposing team. In particular, Gligar and Tirtouga appreciate Slowpoke being lured out and KOed with Thunder Punch, while Scraggy appreciates the same with Spritzee and Zen Headbutt. Scraggy also likes Meditite's ability to check Swirlix. Meditite also appreciates entry hazards. Stealth Rock can help Meditite get more OHKOs, such as on Vullaby with High Jump Kick and on Berry Juice Chinchou with Drain Punch. Sticky Web is another entry hazard that Meditite likes, as it can turn Meditite into a threatening sweeper that can outpace most -1 Speed opponents.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Zen Headbutt
move 3: Ice Punch
move 4: Trick / Drain Punch
ability: Pure Power
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 76 Def / 196 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

High Jump Kick is the primary move on the Choice Scarf set, as alongside the boosted Speed, Meditite can often pull off late-game sweeps with its power. Zen Headbutt is the more reliable STAB move and should be used more frequently than High Jump Kick if the opposing team has a Ghost-type. Ice Punch allows Meditite to revenge kill Murkrow and Gligar, which are often caught off-guard if they don't suspect Meditite is wearing a Choice Scarf. In the final slot, Trick is a great option that can make Slowpoke and Spritzee easier to handle. Alternatively, Drain Punch is a more reliable Fighting-type STAB attack if you don't want to risk missing. Thunder Punch could be used in the final slot, but Trick already cripples Slowpoke. Baton Pass is another option which can be used to keep momentum if you predict the opponent to switch.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is very simple here. Speed and Attack are fully invested in, with the remaining EVs giving Meditite an extra point in HP and Defense. Adamant is the primary nature as a Choice Scarf already remedies its Speed problems, but Jolly lets it outspeed +1 Jolly Scraggy and speed tie with Scarf Chinchou and Mienfoo.

Usage Tips
========

This set is quite simple to use; it can come in mid-game to revenge kill threats and damage the opposing team, and late-game to sweep with High Jump Kick once all Fighting resists have been removed. With a Choice Scarf, Meditite can outspeed and revenge kill many threats that the other sets struggle against such as Gligar and Misdreavus. This gives Meditite a large surprise factor, as it is not expected to outspeed these Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Meditite really appreciates the support of anything that can counter Ghost-types so it can freely use High Jump Kick. Pawniard and Stunky are fantastic options that can use Pursuit to trap Ghost-types. Meditite also likes the support of Knock Off users to weaken bulky walls that could give it trouble. Gligar, Pawniard, and Tirtouga are all choices that can Knock Off Eviolites from physical walls. Other Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Scraggy, and Croagunk can also help by using Knock Off on Fairy-type counters such as Spritzee.

Other Options
########

In terms of coverage moves, Meditite has access to Fire Punch to hit Honedge, which otherwise completely walls it. Poison Jab is another option that hits Fairy-types hard. Recover is an option to boost Meditite's longevity more reliably than Drain Punch, but Meditite's main purpose is to hit hard and it needs as much coverage as it can get. Meditite has access to Bulk Up, Calm Mind, and Baton Pass, which can be used to pass boosts to teammates. It can even run Baton Pass without any boosting moves in order to be part of a Baton Pass chain, which works well with Pokemon such as Torchic and Gligar. Meditite can attempt to sweep using a Bulk Up set, but its chances of sweeping are quite low with many faster threats roaming around. Berry Juice is another useful option, especially if you don't want to use Drain Punch. Finally, Substitute eases prediction and allows Meditite to avoid status. A Berry Juice set consisting of Substitute, High Jump Kick, Ice Punch, and either Thunder Punch or Zen Headbutt is very usable.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ghost-types**: Due to their immunity to Meditite's primary STAB, Ghost-types make excellent counters to it. Honedge, in particular, resists every move that Meditite commonly carries, and can hit back with a super effective Shadow Sneak. Misdreavus doesn't like switching into Zen Headbutt, especially without an Eviolite, but it can outspeed Meditite and hit it hard with Shadow Ball. Gastly is very frail so it cannot switch in too well, but it outspeeds Meditite and has super effective STAB moves.

**Psychic-types**: Psychic-types resists both of Meditite's STAB moves so they often have no trouble switching in. Slowpoke fears only Thunder Punch and can use Scald or Thunder Wave to cripple Meditite. Elgyem and Mime Jr. are slightly less common Psychic-types that can take anything Meditite throws at them and hit back. Finally, Wynaut rarely fails to remove Meditite from the game thanks to Shadow Tag and Counter.

**Fairy-types**: Fairy is another type that resists Fighting, so they also make good counters. Spritzee walls sets without Life Orb and only fears the occasional Poison Jab. Snubbull has access to Intimidate which can force Meditite out.

**Flying-types**: Although it's weak to Ice Punch, Gligar is faster and can OHKO with Acrobatics after Berry Juice has been consumed. Murkrow and Fletchling hate switching in, but are both able to revenge kill Meditite.

**Certain Bulky Fire-types**: Growlithe is another Intimidate user that can force Meditite out, threatening it with a burn. Thanks to its Bug typing, Larvesta resists Fighting and has Flame Body to discourage Meditite from attacking it. Ponyta risks being 2HKOed by Drain Punch, but it can be sent in to try and activate Flame Body as a last-ditch attempt to stop Meditite.

**Poison-types**: Although weak to Psychic-type moves, if Meditite doesn't carry Zen Headbutt, Koffing and Grimer can both wall it, the former also being able to threaten it with a burn.

**Status**: Being burnt or paralyzed severely cripples Meditite so it must be wary around certain Pokemon. Foongus and Slowpoke can paralyze it with Stun Spore and Thunder Wave, respectively. Scald burns from bulky Water-types like Chinchou can also stop Meditite from functioning well. Although confusion is rare, Meditite is very vulnerable to it due to its high Attack stat.
