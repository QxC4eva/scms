<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rock Slide is mainly used by Rhydon and Golem as a way to dispose of Zapdos and deal huge damage to Ice-types such as Lapras and Jynx, and also deal more damage to Exeggutor since it resists Ground-type attacks. It's a strong STAB attack, though it's generally better to use Earthquake besides the aforementioned cases, since Rock Slide does not flinch in RBY.</p>
