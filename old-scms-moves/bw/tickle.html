[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Attack and Defense by one stage. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Moves that deal no damage and lower the opponent's stats have never been very popular, but Tickle finds itself with one distinct niche: Wobbuffet and Wynaut can use it to great effect to soften up opponents. After several uses of Tickle, you can switch in a Pursuit user for a virtually guaranteed KO, or send in a setup sweeper while the foe helplessly switches out.</p>
