<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>the best sand storm team without any cheap antics like sub sd chomp. titled wolf gang because OFWGKTA is da best. yeah a little bit of background information for my team.. this is required right? anyways, this team is one of most successful teams from the previous rounds back when blaziken was present. it had plenty of successful surprises and sets that weren't well-known making some of my wins in the ladder high way robbery. but even knowing some of my team's surprises, it still managed to pull through because the team is constructed nicely. my team success ranges from peaking #3 in the ladder with a 1490 something rating under the alt f.</p>

<p>yeah i came up with a sandstorm formula that made it so successful and i'm going to leak it! 2 water resists + 2 back-up checks to special threats + 2 sand storm sweepers. hence formed celebi + slowbro (water resists for rain team), + scizor and tyranitar (2 back-up checks to special threats), and two sweepers in the form of landorus and excadrill! getting the formula is simple but now tweaking the weaknesses and problem was the difficult part! to explain further to my formula, two water resists is required so that rain teams are never going to get above you because they are naturally that one play style that can bother sandstorm; two special checks because special attackers are normally problematic for a sandstorm team especially those latios + rain sweepers core that lure in tyranitar; and finally, two sand sweepers to take advantage of the sand and dish out damage.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Celebi</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>don't trip out with the placing of my team because celebi is there to lure in many pokemon at the start of the match. (it doesn't necessarily have to lead though). celebi acts as a my offensive-defensive glue-- oxymoron? nope. celebi does make a fine sweeper with nasty plot + great coverage and makes a fine defensive sponge to water-type moves from rain teams. its a cool pokemon to use with natural cure meaning it won't be discouraged after its been paralyzed or something. giga drain + psychic + hp fire provide optimal coverage. giga drain lets me heal without losing health easily, psychic lets me batter on dragonite, conkeldurr, salamence, and zapdos, whilst hp fire lets me fuck up scizor and nattorei for ohko (assuming rain is in play). let me tell you know skarm is a bitch and celebi can lure in skarmory and 2hko it with a boosted hidden power fire!</p>

<p><strong>Landorus</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sand Force<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>this is one of the best sandstream abusers in the game and has very little counters bar bronzong and skarmory. i chose it because it can break those jirachi/gliscor/rotom-w cores with ease! (i have never lost to that kg team in the ladder once lol). with the influx of scarf/cb/sd landorus, there isn't a single game where i didn't get a substitute up. the simple premise is to hide behind a substitute and dish out boosted earthquake and stone edges. not much can take these hits neutrally and even nattorei is 3hkoed by leftovers earthquake. hidden power ice means that gliscor is lured however, some users are intelligent so i tend to stone edge first time around and hidden power ice the following turn. with this, i can sweep with excadrill relatively easier! yeah- landorus is my favorite ou pokemon right now, it hasn't failed me once!</p>

<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong> @ Chople Berry<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 188 Atk / 68 SpD<br />
Brave Nature<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Rock Slide</p>

<p>one of the metagame's staples and for a good reason: sandstream. it's pretty evident by now that tyranitar is the best supporter in my team by activating two of my primary sweepers' ability and providing stealth rock support. he also adds a much needed check to plenty special threats with CHOPLE BERRY like gengar, thundurus, latios, latias, volcorona at full health (w/o life orb), and plenty more. the ev spread is pretty arbritary but it provides pretty good attacking prowess and i can ohko plenty things with pursuit (fleeing). rock slide ensures i can ohko thundurus while hitting stuff neutrally for great damage. fire blast means skarmory and ferrothorn can't set up easily- however, im looking for some more evs to possibly ohko ferrothorn. overall- this guy is pretty legit and possibly the best supporter in the metagame right now!</p>

<p><strong>Slowbro</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Scald<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Slack Off</p>

<p>with a fine-tuned slowbro in the newer generation, feast your eyes on one of the most annoying physical walls to exist. slowbro acts as my back-up water-type attack sponge because you're bound to have troubles in a tier filled with rain. specs hydro pump is a bitch so this is a pre-requisite for a sand team. anyways, i originally had this for blaziken back when it existed, but overtime i've grown to love slowbro due to its ability to check so many physical threats and provide paralysis support. i would list all of the physical threat slowbro checks but there's just too many; but to get the gist of it he checks excadrill, landorus, conkeldurr, darumaka, gliscor, etc. that's a host of motherfuckin' physical attackers and it really doesn't stop there. thunder wave provides paralysis, whilst the other two provide optimal coverage. scald is much needed to help me deal with swords dance gliscor, while psychic lets me beat virizon and conkeldurr on the switch. overall! i really love this guy!</p>

<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 236 HP / 252 Atk / 20 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Bug Bite<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- Superpower</p>

<p>swords dance scizor is the epitome of someone with raw power capable of battering all types of team: offensive, balanced, or stall. setting up is easily accomplished so getting one or two boosts is no problem. after 4 boosts though, everything is creamed resisted or non-resisted. 252 + adamant + LO ensures maximized damage output. to witness its power a +4 bullet punch can ohko gliscor, thundurus, excadrill, and many more. bug bite is scizor's strongest attack capable of ohkoing many walls after a single boost! superpower over roost? you're a fuckin' nut franky! nah- it's actually quite the beneficial addition to my team. it's my other way of luring skarmory and 2hkoing it with a boosted superpower. skarmory is the biggest problem to my team and i absolutely need to eliminate it from my match. the scenario follows: sd, skarmory switchs in, superpower, it spikes/brave birds/whirwind. if the latter move, i just pray the right pokemon switches in and applies enough pressure otherwise i'm going to have to rinse and repeat. if it spikes and brave bird, it will be pressured to roost leaving it vulnerable to a super effective superpower the following turn. from a defensive standpoint now, scizor makes a back-up check to stuff like latios and latias if tyranitar is in dire shape. overall, this dude has been a fantastic powerhouse and more people should try this guy out!</p>

<p><strong>Excadrill</strong> @ Air Balloon<br />
Ability: Sand Rush<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Rock Slide<br />
- X-Scissor</p>

<p>please take a moment to look at one of the greatest sweepers to exist in pokemon. it is also one of the best revenge killers in the game with a doubled-speed in which no pokemon can beat with a scarf (bar scarf deoxys-s). with sand rush and a grand attack of 135 and access to swords dance, you're bound to struggle countering this literally without a gliscor, bronzong, and skarmory. thank god my team works together in tandem to lure in and severely weaken the previously mentioned. earthquake + rock slide provide optimal coverage alongside each other, whilst x-scissor lets me hit slowbro, reuinculus, and latios and latias for super effective damage! i usually bring this guy late game to sweep the dirt for me. the only case where i have to bring him in early is when i have to check garchomp or something! for my item choice, i'm selecting air balloon cause' it adds a nice ground-immunity to my team to help overcome stuff like garchomp and even opposing excradrill. i need my excadrill in pristine condition so avoiding spikes is a beneficial factor to his sweep attempt later on. overall, this is one of the best sweepers in the game and applies so much pressure to the opponent.</p>
