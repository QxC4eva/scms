<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack, Special Attack, and Speed by two stages and lowers the user's Defense and Special Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Shell Smash is, quite arguably, the best boosting move in the entire game. The ability to essentially give the user a Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, and Agility boost in one turn can turn almost any Pokemon into a fearsome sweeper. This is especially true in the case of Cloyster who, with the addition of Shell Smash to its movepool, instantly changed from a UU hazard setter and Rapid Spin user into a fearsome OU sweeper who can even sweep Ubers teams with ease. The combination of Shell Smash and Baton Pass from Pokemon like Gorebyss and Smeargle (commonly referred to as SmashPass) can give these boosts to even more fearsome sweepers such as Dragonite, who can already rip apart teams. The side effects of Shell Smash, the lowered defenses, is commonly remedied by having the user hold a White Herb, which essentially gives the user +2/+2/+2 offenses with no drawbacks, at the cost of being unable to hold another item.</p>
