
Overview
########

While Greninja's instant popularity in contrast its viability is certainly a hot topic of debate, it can be argued that unlike other Pokemon, it's actually earned its celebrity status. Greninja is a consistent threat to watch out for in OU because it has a number of defining qualities, including its incredibly high Speed stat, incredible offensive ability in Protean, and plenty of coverage moves to abuse said ability with. The only things holding Greninja back from unquestionable stardom are its otherwise average offensive stats, frailty, and vulnerability to common priority attacks. Because of these, Greninja can be killed relatively easily by opposing tanks and a large number of priority users in the tier, and is forced to run fully special sets to reap as much coverage and power as possible. Fortunately, these factors don't fully stop Greninja from being an otherwise truly dangerous monster to prepare for; one that can significantly weaken or even swiftly clean teams with just a little team support.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-out Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Dark Pulse / Extrasensory
move 4: U-turn / Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Fire
ability: Protean
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Timid

Moves
========

With any combination of the given moves, Greninja achieves great power and coverage to batter the opposition with. Hydro Pump is Greninja's most powerful move (besides Hyper Beam), benefitting from already great coverage, and should be used against bulkier targets in general. Ice Beam is essential, as it provides coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types, and also operates as Greninja's main "STAB" move if Hydro Pump's inaccuracy might be too risky in any situation.

The rest of the set comes down to preferences; Greninja must unfortunately risk losing coverage against some of its counters if it chooses specific ones. Dark Pulse hits Psychic- and Ghost-types super effectively, including important bulky targets such as Jirachi, Metagross, Aegislash, and Jellicent. The former three, however, have some difficulty taking Hydro Pump already. Extrasensory allows Greninja to heavily damage some of its most important counters, including Keldeo, Tentacruel, Conkeldurr, and Mega Venusaur. U-turn is a great option for reliable scouting early-game, and compensates somewhat for any possible coverage issues. It also hits some threats, such as Celebi and Latias, harder than other moves. Hidden Power Grass is used to hit opposing Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types hard, but is mainly used to hit popular bulky targets such as Rotom-W and Gastrodon. Hidden Power Fire can be used to reliably hit a smaller, but equally important list of targets, especially Ferrothorn, specially defensive Scizor, and Forretress.

Grass Knot can be used instead of Hidden Power Grass, but differs somewhat in targets; it is especially reserved for Jellicent and Tyranitar, and can also be used in case Greninja needs to compensate for lost coverage against Jellicent if lacking Dark Pulse.

Set Details
========

Maximized Speed and Special Attack with either a Timid or Naive nature gives Greninja maximum power and a huge advantage over many fast unboosted threats in OU, including Alakazam, Tornadus-T, Starmie, Latios, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and many others. These threats are so important that Modest or Rash natures should not be considered. If Greninja does not use U-turn, it should be using a Timid nature. A Naive nature is chosen over Hasty in order to take some resisted priority moves better. Life Orb is also a requirement, as Greninja needs all the power it can get, and unlike other Pokemon, it is not exactly bothered too much by the recoil to the point of considering alternative items such as Expert Belt.

Usage Tips
========

This set can be used at absolutely any time in the game; it's your call whether Greninja is an early- to mid-game threat, or even a late-game cleaner. Typically, due to its frailty, Greninja should be sent in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, or after a teammate has fainted.

As a word of caution, do not overestimate Greninja's capabilities. Despite Protean boosting its attacks, Greninja cannot OHKO many bulky opponents, such as Keldeo, Latias, and Togekiss, at full heath, giving many of them opportunities to sponge an attack and retaliate. If faced against such Pokemon, Greninja should not switch in at all, or retreat (with U-turn if possible) and let another Pokemon either handle them or weaken them to Greninja's KO range. Additionally, do NOT attempt to wall or resist moves with Protean, as Greninja is still very frail and has to deal with taking additional damage along with Life Orb recoil.

Team Options
========

Greninja applies tons of offensive pressure against most opposing teams, so it appreciates entry hazards to rack up additional damage and punish switch-ins. Reliable providers include Deoxys-S, Smeargle, and, especially for VoltTurn teams, Landorus-T. Speaking of VoltTurn, U-turn Greninja is a great and speedy fit on these types of teams for reasons provided above, so it naturally pairs well with Pokemon such as Thundurus, Landorus-T, and Scizor to cover each others' checks and counters. As Greninja will occasionally be required to sweep when the situation calls for it, it may need additional insurance against special walls such as Blissey, Sylveon, and Rotom-W. Scizor can typically handle the former two, while Goodra, Latias, and Assault Vest Conkeldurr can typically absorb Will-o-Wisp from Rotom-W and hit back hard.

Spikes
########
name: Spikes
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: U-turn / Extrasensory
ability: Protean
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Due to the amount of switches and free time Greninja generates, it has many opportunities to use Spikes to casually support its teammates and generate more damage. Hydro Pump, as usual, provides great power and coverage in one slot. Ice Beam is even more important than ever; in addition to serving as a good alternative main move to Hydro Pump, it typically KOes common users of Defog, including Latios, Latias, and Mandibuzz, who might come in to remove hazards. U-turn is somewhat complementary with Greninja's chosen entry hazard, as it allows Greninja to escape Rapid Spin users on top of other usual counters. Extrasensory is an alternative option to reliably hit Keldeo, Mega Venusaur, and, most importantly, Rapid Spin Tentacruel. Hidden Power Ghost can also be used to block Rapid Spin; however, it is otherwise significantly inferior to other attacks in terms of overall power, coverage, and usability. Toxic Spikes is also worth considering to wear down defensive targets such as Blissey, though keep in mind that Toxic Spikes are generally easier to remove and avoid for levitating and Steel-type opponents.

Set Details
========

Greninja needs to be as fast as possible to lay down Spikes, and as powerful to score KOes on opponents when needed. Therefore, the usual maximized Speed, Special Attack, and Life Orb combo will suffice for this set. As far as other options are concerned Focus Sash almost guarantees that Greninja will be able to set up at least one layer of hazards, or perhaps survive an attack and KO back.

Usage Tips
========

Although this set employs Spikes, only lay them down when you believe it is necessary; it is not recommended to miss important potential killing opportunities (against Pokemon that give your other teammates trouble) just to lay a single layer of Spikes. Instead, attempt to lay hazards down early-game, where Greninja can force out a multitude of switches and use Spikes in predicted switches, or against walls that can't hurt it too much. One of Greninja's best opportunities to lay down hazards is the face of slower Pokemon that rely on Electric-type moves. Spikes will turn Greninja Ground-type thanks to Protean, and will thus make it immune to Volt Switch and other Electric-type moves, and essentially giving it another free turn to use Spikes or attack. Keep in mind that multiple layers of Spikes or Toxic Spikes are also not necessary, as Greninja might not find multiple opportunities to set too many layers.

When using attacks, the premise is the same with the All-Out Attacker set; simply attack and watch as the opponent takes huge damage or switches out and racks up even more damage from hazards.

Team Options
========

Spikes Greninja is best suited for offensive teams where dedicated leads or hazard layers such as Deoxys-S are unwanted. Greninja differentiates itself from these archetypes since it has outstanding offensive presence, and also forces switches and thus setup opportunities. In the case of Spikes, Greninja should be paired with offensive Pokemon that benefit from grounded checks and counters being worn down. Swords Dance Lucario is a great example of this, since it needs just one layer of Spikes to guarantee the OHKO on Physically Defensive Hippowdon and other walls. Pokemon that can apply pressure and force switches (and thus rack up more damage) also apply for both types of Spikes, including Substitute Kyurem-B and bulky Rotom-W.

While Greninja typically isn't exactly bothered by the presence of Rapid Spin and Defog users by itself, running a spinblocker is a good idea to counteract the latter if your Pokemon are truly reliant on Spikes or Toxic Spikes. Gengar is a good example in this case, since it can take on common Rapid Spin users except Starmie, which Greninja can outspeed and threaten with U-turn. Defog is a little harder to prevent, but attempts can either be blocked with Taunt, or punished by using the oft-unprepared-for Defiant Bisharp. If using Bisharp, also consider pairing both Greninja and Bisharp with Aegislash to limit the amount of hazards opposing Deoxys-S may set up.

Other Options
########

A physical set is inferior due to Greninja's weak and limited list of physical moves, most of which are also lacking in decent coverage besides mostly Normal, Dark, and Water. A mixed set also falls under this category, since Greninja might have to split EVs between Attack, Special Attack, and Speed just to boost its physical moves. Water Shuriken might seem cool on paper for revenge killing Talonflame, though it is limited since it takes up a moveslot and does physical damage.

Checks & Counters
########

**Residual Damage**: Greninja is already frail and relies on Life Orb to make up for its average power. When paired with burn, poison, and random entry hazards, Life Orb recoil can add up quickly and severely shorten Greninja's lifespan.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Pokemon with a high amount of Special Defense and / or Assault Vest can sponge most of Greninja's special attacks and wear it down or outright KO it. Blissey, Chansey, Clefable, Cresselia, Goodra, Ferrothorn, and Tentacruel are common examples of such Pokemon, although the former three are the only ones that can reliably switch into Greninja without getting worn down by a super effective hit.

**Bulky Attackers**: There are Pokemon that can resist move of Greninja's most commonly used moves, possibly survive attacks reserved specifically for them, and hit back hard. With the exception of Extrasensory, Keldeo and Mega Venusaur resists all of Greninja's most commonly used moves with ease, and can hit back with their STAB attacks. Assault Vest Conkeldurr can also wave off most attacks and either heal with Drain Punch or outright attack with Mach Punch, although like the previous two, it must watch out for Extrasensory. Furthermore, Kyurem, Kyurem-B, Azumarill, and Mega Gyarados are all naturally bulky and tank most of Greninja's usual attacks.

**Faster Attackers**: Revenge killing is a reliable way of eliminating Greninja, though its Water typing makes it naturally resist Bullet Punch and Ice Shard. The most reliable way to revenge kill it besides using Choice Scarf Pokemon or naturally faster Pokemon (such as Deoxys-S and Jolteon) is with powerful priority users. Assuming Greninja does not change into a type that resists a particular priority attack, Talonflame, Scizor , Entei, and Conkeldurr are able to at least deal hefty damage, if not outright OHKO, with their respective own. Sucker Punch from Absol and Bisharp also does a heavy amount of damage, assuming Greninja is not Dark-type at the time. Thundurus-I also technically applies, as it can paralyze Greninja with Prankster Thunder Wave and leave it crippled for the rest of the match.
