Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Defog
move 2: Recover
move 3: Judgment
move 4: Will-O-Wisp
ability: Multitype
item: Stone Plate
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe

Moves
========

· Judgment provides a reliable, decently powerful STAB move. Handles the numerous flying types in Ubers (read: Ho-oh) well.

· Recover provides longevity, which is a must on any defog supporter.

· Defog removes hazards and screens, which, by all accounts, is pretty neat.

· Will-O-Wisp messes up the physical attackers that would otherwise prove problematic for this set.


Set Details
========

· Max Speed with a timid nature is amongst the better spreads for support Arceus-Rock, since being outsped by other Arceus forms sucks.

· That said, some lower speed investments can be used to outspeed specific threats and add bulk. Most notably, investing 96 Speed with a positive nature enables Rock Arceus to outrun all Base 100s, 112 zips past Garchomp, and 176/184 eclipse Base 110s and Thundurus respectively.

· Max HP is self-explanatory. Placing 4 EVs in defense prevents Genesect from getting an attack boost, and thus gives Arceus-Rock a slim chance to avoid a 2hko from Iron Head.


Usage Tips
========

· This set’s main role is to keep hazards off your field and spread status (usually burn).

· Arceus-Rock is one of the few Pokémon in the tier than can easily switch into either of Ho-oh’s STAB attacks. Be somewhat wary of the fiery turkey, though; Earthquake from a banded set does more than enough to 2hko.

· Will-o-wisp combined with solid base defenses allows it to serve as an okay check to a number of physical attackers (including some with super-effective coverage). Don’t rely too much on this capability, though, as a well-placed Lum Berry can result in its demise.

· The presence of Sandstorm allows Arceus-Rock to reach a ridiculously high level of special defense, further increasing its longevity.


Team Options
========

· Having either Tyranitar or Hippowdon on your team can be useful, as Sandstorm’s special defense boost is very cool (see above). Rock Arceus shares a multitude of common weaknesses with these teammates, though, so it’s not always advisable.

· Since Kyogre flat-out demolishes Arceus-Rock, having a check, such as Assault Vest Palkia, is essential.

· As this set lacks refresh, having a teammate with Aromatherapy or Heal Bell (i.e. Xerneas, Chansey) prevents statuses like Toxic from wearing down Arceus-Rock over time. Xerneas also has a handy resistance to the fighting types that plagued Rock Arceus in Gen V, but shares a common weakness to steels.

· Shaymin-S is a pretty good teammate all-around, as it tears through the most of the offensive threats to Arceus-Rock (Ground, Grass, Fighting, Water) while also appreciating the latter’s resistances to Flying/Fire and ability to clear Stealth Rock.

· Ho-oh also covers a wide range of threats to Rock Arceus (although the two share a common weakness to Water) and provides much more bulk than Shaymin-S.


Calm Mind Mono-Attacker
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Judgment
move 3: Recover
move 4: Refresh / Will-O-Wisp
ability: Multitype
item: Stone Plate
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spd

Moves
========

· Calm Mind is, as one might expect, is what makes this set click. After just a couple of boosts, Rock Arceus can handle a good part of the tier with its powerful Special Attack and nigh-on impregnable special defense.

· Judgment serves as an effective STAB move which, notably, has no immunities.

· Recover helps prevent Rock Arceus from getting worn down by chip damage and priority.

· Refresh has a rather self-explanatory role, removing statuses that would otherwise put Rock Arceus on a timer.

· Will-o-Wisp, on the other hand, allows this set to cripple physical attackers, patching its weaker defensive stat (after the CM boosts, ofc).

Set Details
========

· Max HP what it is (Take more hits => Do more in return => Profit).

· 96+ Speed, as stated before, is the benchmark to outspeed Timid Base 100 opponents, the fastest of the common threats that Rock Arceus can potentially outspeed. Other speed investments can allow Rock Arceus to outspeed various other mons (see mentions in Support set).

· Investing 160 EVs in defense allows Rock Arceus to patch up the defensive stat which isn’t being boosted by Calm Mind / Sandstorm.

Usage Tips
========

· The same tips as with the support set still hold true – just a different role

· It’s very likely that your opponent will have their Rock Arceus checks intact in the early and mid game; as such, this set tends to work best when it sets up in the lategame. Don’t try to force a setup too early.

· Sets lacking Will-o-wisp can’t stop threats like Groudon or Garchomp from switching in freely and smashing Rock Arceus with an Earthquake, while Toxic and Thunder Wave can cripple sets lacking Refresh. Know your weaknesses and play accordingly.

· CM Arceus sets with type advantages are often this set’s bane – don’t bother continuing to set up against them unless you’re at least at +3 on the switch-in. The majority of these threats are checked by Ho-oh, while CM Water Arceus will either fear status or physical threats like scarfed Zekrom.

Team Options
========

· Sandstorm setters – see above description

· Kyogre check (i.e. AV Palkia)

· Shaymin-S / Ho-oh – very good type synergy (see above)

· Lugia / Giratina – cover weaknesses to fighting/grass, plus either ground or water depending on which of the two is used.


Other Options
########

· Can run a Swords Dance set, but Stone Edge is unreliable as your only STAB move, and the set is generally outclassed by Arceus-Ground.

· Stealth Rock can replace Defog on the support set, particularly if there are other potential defoggers/spinners on your team. It tends to have a higher opportunity cost than Defog, though, and there are plenty of other viable SR users in the metagame.

· Toxic can similarly be used over Will-O-Wisp on the support set, as it takes more of a toll on special setup sweepers. Not having Will-O causes some different problems, though, as the set becomes (a) unable to handle many physical threats and (b) complete setup fodder for the tier’s many Steel types.


Checks & Counters
########

· Every common Kyogre set is a major threat to Rock Arceus; sets running Choice Scarf / Specs will ohko the fossilized deer with Water Spout and Surf respectively, while defensive sets still do heavy damage and can force out Calm Mind Rock Arceus with Roar.

· Mega Mewtwo-X outspeeds Rock Arceus, can prevent annoyances like Will-o –Wisp with Taunt, and rips Rockceus a new one with Low Kick.

· Arceus-Fighting was the bane of Rock Arceus last generation, and although the former has seen decreased usage of late, it still remains capable of ripping through its rocky cousin. Likewise, any other Arceus forme with a type advantage is capable of 2-shotting Rock Arceus.

· Chansey has little to fear from any variation of Rock Arceus (barring the obscure SD set) and can often cripple it with status moves.

· Other common Steel and/or Fighting types (i.e. Mega Lucario) can punch holes in Rock Arceus, particularly if it lacks Will-o.

· Ferrothorn/Amoongus/other bulky grass mons can sponge hits and wear down the petrified titan.

· Shaymin-S (purely an offensive threat, as it can’t take hits).
