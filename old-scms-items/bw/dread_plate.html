[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that increases the Base Power of all Dark-type moves by 20%. When held by a Pokemon with the Multitype ability, the holder's type will change to Dark.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Although Dark-type Arceus isn't as useful as Ghost-type Arceus, who has more useful immunities, Dark Arceus has the advantage of having no Pokemon immune to its STAB. The Dread Plate turns Arceus into a fantastic Calm Mind abuser, and with the help of Recover and Refresh, it can often muscle through even the most solid of stall teams and defensive walls, sometimes by itself.</p>

<p>However, it is generally useless aside from Arceus, as most other Dark-types find the power boost from Dread Plate to be too menial.</p>

<h2>Location</h2> 
<p>Abyssal Ruins, 1F.</p>
