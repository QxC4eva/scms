<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Speed by two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>As far as boosting moves go, Rock Polish is not as universally neglected as moves that solely raise Defense or Special Defense, but it is far less popular than offensive boosting moves. The main reason for this is that Rock Polish wastes a valuable turn increasing Speed instead of increasing an offensive stat. In spite of this, Rock Polish is typically distributed to Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types, most of which are very slow and desperately need a Speed increase to function well offensively, or just to outrun everything and its mother. The power that many of these Pokemon have also plays into the use of Rock Polish.</p>

<p>There are a few interesting combinations for this move. One very common way to use Rock Polish is in a "Double Dancer" set paired with Swords Dance, where the user can use either Rock Polish to outrun and demolish offensive teams, or Swords Dance to break through defensive teams. The most prominent user of this strategy in OU is Terrakion, whose awesome coverage with its STAB moves really help the set to work. Groudon can use a similar set in Ubers. Some Pokemon may forgo Swords Dance and solely use Rock Polish, such as Landorus in OU and Rampardos in NU. The advantage in doing so is that the user has an extra moveslot for coverage in exchange for a weaker Attack. Rock Polish is also used by Baton Pass users, such as Mew.</p>
