            Guess you could say that we gave them a Fake Out<br/>
            Stuck three fingers up there like a boy scout<br/>

            We're out of the pound and we got some lines to spout<br/>
            And when we're done we'll serve you cats like smoked trout<br/>
            Cause we're the hot dogs to your sauerkraut.<br/>
            <br/>

            Sand Rushin' with the Hippo and my bro Mamoswine<br/>
            And my boy Granbull reppin' the new Fairy design<br/>

            wow. many hurt. such rap. very talentful.<br/>
            Man, your one and only meme is overused and pitiful<br/>
            Us cats are everywhere 'cause we're nothin' but wonderful<br/>
            Bitches want us banned 'cause we're damn near untouchable<br/>
            Our swag is off the charts, paralyzin' hoes on an infinite interval<br/>
            Foul Playing your asses makes fighting us regrettable<br/>
            Listen nigga, yo bravery is actually quite commendable<br/>
            But just don't be alarmed when you lose a fuckin' testicle.<br/>
            <br/>
            My crew rocks 9 lives, y'all can't even compete<br/>
            You'd best just beg to your master for a retreat<br/>
            'Cause we be Fury Swiping for days without a fleet<br/>
            Pyroar be pouncin' on yo Mightyenas on repeat<br/>
            Kings of Pride Rock make y'all obsolete<br/>
            My bro Meowstic and I be pranking as a treat<br/>
            Yo, despite our sizes lookin' pretty petite<br/>
            We got tricks up our sleeves for ya to admit defeat.

    <div class="battle-section dogs">
        <div class="verse">
            Yo crew needs 9 lives? We only need one<br/>
            'Cause we go hardest bar none<br/>
            Even if ya got 9 bars y'all are one and done<br/>
            Since yo crew is a bunch of pussies son<br/>
            Pussy cats that is, go bake some hot crossed buns<br/>
            One a penny, two a penny, shoot you with a gun<br/>
            1 down 8 to go, and we've only just begun<br/>
            Still though, it's pretty clear that we've already won.<br/>
            <br/>
            We don't care about your tricks cause we loyal<br/>
            And they're still as overplayed as Lorde's Royal<br/>
            Hope they serve ya boys in a Chinese restaurant broiled<br/>
            I'll be eatin' my Scooby Snax with a Blissey egg Soft-Boiled<br/>
            Hit us with a Double-Edge and you'll die from recoil<br/>
            Catch us on the Rebound like a Colossoil<br/>
            Take Down you fools like tin foil<br/>
            'Cause we're as smooth as extra virgin olive oil.

            Like, zoinks, man, why don't ya just let go?<br/>
            You dogs are in trouble, cue the "Ruh-roe!"<br/>
            Ya think you smooth, but y'all are Purugly, bro<br/>
            We classy, sassy, sexy, like Monroe<br/>
            Not to mention cute like my babe Litleo<br/>
            Encore, encore! Y'all been putting on a great show<br/>
            But careful not to make one wrong move, though<br/>
            Or expect to be next on Dr. Phil's talk show.<br/>
            <br/>
            I mean, did ya get Switcheroo'd a Lagging Tail? 'Cause you laggin' behind<br/>
            Plottin' nasty thoughts is part of our grind<br/>

            'Cause plot 3 times and we take over mankind<br/>
            Y'all just begun? Perhaps it's time to unwind<br/>
            I'll let ya know we won't be as kind<br/>
            As we be Sand Attackin' to make ya go blind<br/>
            With our pieces of shit on yo face, hope ya like it signed.

            We bustin' moves like our boy Hong Kong Phooey<br/>
            One more meow and your crew's chop suey<br/>
            Served with Peking ducks Huey Duey and Louie<br/>
            On that Duck Tales shit with Scrooge the screwy<br/>
            Speed droppin' ya cause our slobber is Gooey<br/>
            Scooby Dooby, I'm rockin' it hella groovy<br/>
            Gonna teach you some moves like I taught ya how to dougie<br/>
            Hope you cats can swim in our heated up jacuzzi.<br/>
            <br/>
            Spittin' fumes hotter than my boy Houndoom<br/>
            While you coughin' up hairballs in the dining room<br/>
            That's to be expected when ya lick yourself to groom<br/>
            That shit's like saliva scented perfume<br/>
            Smells so ratchet like Stun Spore Vileplume<br/>
            So you can give up and start sucking our fruit of the loom<br/>
            Like the high school girls who have ya as a Halloween costume<br/>
            So choke on this hairball 'cause that's more than you can consume.

            Damn it really is startin' to rain cats and dogs<br/>
            Have fun survivin' as we land on all four paws<br/>
            We're such a mystery not even Scooby can solve<br/>
            You mad chicks dig us 'cause yo dick's so small?<br/>
            It's either man's best friend or nothin' at all<br/>
            Y'all can't even go a day alone without a bawl<br/>
            Let alone take a Sucker Punch from my man Mega Absol<br/>
            'Cause our feline instincts will fuck you up like a rag doll.<br/>
            <br/>
            Yo rhymes don't hurt 'cause of my girl Espeon's Magic Bounce<br/>
            Meanwhile we're preparing for the one deadly pounce<br/>
            Might be worth runnin' to your pathetic dog house<br/>
            Before we scratch off yo skin ounce by ounce<br/>
            And tear off yo limbs with Raikou's saber-tooth mouth<br/>
            Our terror is unbearable, much like Kyogre's Water Spout<br/>
            So let's play a game, me the cat and you the mouse<br/>
            But looks like you already lost, the people announce.
