[SHORT DESC]
Changes type according to weather. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>This Pokémon's type changes to Fire under sun, to Water under rain, and to Ice under hail. Forecast does not change the Pokémon's type in sandstorm or fog. If this Pokémon is changed to a certain type, and then is hit with Gastro Acid, or receives a different trait via Role Play or Skill Swap, it is stuck in that same form until it switches, even if the weather changes.</p>
