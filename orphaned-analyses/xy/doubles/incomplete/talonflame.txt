Overview
########
<p>Talonflame's role is very straightforward: be faster than fast. Gale Wings gives its Flying-type attacks boosted priority, which, in addition to its already blazing 126 base Speed, makes it the perfect choice for picking off any weakened threat, as it is almost guaranteed to outspeed. Its Brave Bird is the strongest +1 priority move in the game by a fairly wide margin and, when combined with Flare Blitz, has great coverage. Furthermore, it is a great choice for fast teams that struggle with Trick Room, as it has a very fast Taunt and can still use its +1 priority moves if Trick Room does happen to go up. If all else fails, it has a priority Tailwind&emdash;a very useful suicide move.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Talonflame runs into a lot of trouble when it comes to base stats. Aside from Speed, its numbers are decidedly worse than mediocre, having a lower main attacking stat than Amoonguss. Furthermore, its defenses are absolutely terrible, between its low base stats, weaknesses to common Water- and Rock-type attacks, and penchant for KOing itself with its STAB moves. All this adds up to Talonflame being absolutely hopeless in a damage war against bulky Pokemon and very liable to be KOed.</p>

Choice Band
########
<p>Talonflame @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Gale Wings<br />
EVs: 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Brave Bird<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Taunt<br />

Moves
========
<p>Brave Bird and Flare Blitz, as above, are mandatory STAB, while U-turn is incredibly weak but better than a dry switch. Taunt is an odd move for a banded set, but it is useful in preventing Trick Room from going up before you switch out.</p>

Set Details
========
<p>176 Speed is standard on Talonflame in order to outspeed Thundurus-Therian which is the fastest threat that you need to Flare Blitz while staying Adamant. Adamant is almost mandatory because the power drop from Jolly would be too much. Choice Band is a great item choice on Talonflame because it allows priority Brave Bird to actually score some OHKOs.</p>

Usage Tips
========
<p>Choice Band Talonflame can be used as a mid-game hole opener, revenge killer, priority safety net or late-game clean-up crew. Intimidate makes you useless against full HP Pokemon that you can only hit neutrally, but there is reason to stay in if you can still pick something off or hit Super Effectively. As with most U-Turners, it is much more effective to dry switch if you feel like you will be blocked by Protect or Fake Out. Unless you are up against Sun, most of the time you should just be clicking the Brave Bird button.</p>

Moves
========
<p>Talonflame's main goal is to hit things with a priority Brave Bird; the rest of his moves are for when that doesn't suffice. Flare Blitz provides additional coverage, while Taunt helps Talonflame deal with bulkier Pokemon and Tailwind lets Talonflame throw out emergency support against faster teams that it cannot handle on its own. It is advised to pick only one of these so that Talonflame has room for Protect, but both can be run.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulkier Pokemon that don't fear Taunt are the best answer to Talonflame, as it doesn't have enough power to win in a slugfest. Of these, three stand out above the rest: Tyranitar, who resists both of Talonflame's STAB moves and can return with super effective STAB, Rotom-W, who does the same, and Slowbro, who can easily tank a Brave Bird and return a Scald, while also being immune to Talonflame's Taunt if Oblivious or being able to heal off the damage if Regenerator. Failing one of these surefire counters, the best way to handle Talonflame is to remove its Speed through Thunder Wave or Trick Room. Though Talonflame will still have its fast Brave Bird, everything else will become garbage.</p>
