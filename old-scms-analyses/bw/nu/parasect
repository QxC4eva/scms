[Overview]

<p>Parasect isn't particularly bulky, nor is it powerful, but what makes it unique is its great typing. With resistances to Ground-, Electric-, Fighting-, and Grass-type moves, and an immunity to Water-type moves, thanks to Dry Skin, Parasect is an excellent support Pokemon. Furthermore, Parasect has access to a 100% accurate sleep move: Spore. Spore is Parasect's most dangerous asset, enabling it to set up or support its teammates with ease. It's not all good news for Parasect though; Stealth Rock strips 25% of its health, and a crippling weakness to Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-type moves make it very easy to revenge kill. Also, Parasect is painfully slow, and the only way to remedy this is with Stun Spore or serious team support. It's a mixed bag of a Pokemon, but use it correctly and Parasect won't disappoint.</p>

<p>Although it isn't the bulkiest Pokemon around, Parasect has a variety of useful resistances, an immunity to Water-type moves, and a 100% accurate sleep-inducing move to boot. The idea is to switch into a resisted attack, put the opponent to sleep, and proceed with Leech Seed, Aromatherapy, or Substitute. Leech Seed helps keep Parasect alive as long as possible, Aromatherapy keeps it free from status, Substitute can be used on a switch, and Protect gives Parasect an extra turn of Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery. X-Scissor gives Parasect a way to hit Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed, and also receives a STAB boost.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs attempt to balance Parasect's defenses; thanks to its numerous resistances, Parasect can take on a mixture of physical and special attacks including, but not limited to: Thunderbolt, Earthquake, Close Combat, and Energy Ball. Synthesis can be used to restore Parasect's health, and it's more reliable than Leech Seed; however, it doesn't weaken the opponent, and since Parasect is so slow, it needs to survive an attack before recovering. Light Screen can be used to raise Parasect's Special Defense for a limited amount of time, and it's a helpful move to aid frail Pokemon in setting up. Knock Off is another viable option to beat Eviolite users, and finally, Stun Spore forms part of a double status set, and it also forces a lot of switches.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin support is appreciated as Parasect loses 25% of its health upon switching in. Armaldo and Wartortle are great Rapid Spin users in addition to their decent type synergy with Parasect. Pokemon that can switch into Parasect's weaknesses are helpful, especially Pokemon that lure in Water-type moves. Probopass is an excellent partner as it resists Flying-, Ice-, and Bug-type moves, and it lures Ground-, Fighting-, and Water-type moves. Camerupt resists Fire- and Bug-type moves, and can take on Fire-types with ease. Furthermore, Camerupt acts as a lure for Water-type moves, can set up Stealth Rock, and has access to Will-O-Wisp to weaken physical attackers.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Parasect isn't the fastest or the most powerful Pokemon in the tier, but one thing makes it unique: Spore. The idea is to put an opponent or counter to sleep, set up Swords Dance, and fire off boosted attacks. Parasect's resistances and immunities give it plenty of opportunities to set up, helping it nab multiple boosts. X-Scissor and Seed Bomb are both reliable STAB moves, and Brick Break and Aerial Ace provide additional coverage. Brick Break provides coverage against Steel-types that wall Parasect, whereas Aerial Ace can be used with Seed Bomb to hit opposing Grass-types, but leaves Parasect walled by Steel-types. Seed Bomb is listed as it hits Water-types super effectively, and it has better overall coverage than X-Scissor.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Parasect is slow, and even with Speed EVs, it isn't going to outrun many Pokemon. 208 EVs give it enough Speed to outrun Exeggutor and Cacturne with no investment. A bulkier spread with 252 HP EVs can be used if you prefer the ability to take hits, but it makes Parasect much easier to revenge kill. A double dance set can be used with Agility, but even with a Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment, Parasect is slow. Furthermore, it requires Parasect to sacrifice Spore or a coverage move, making it a poor option.</p>

<p>Support from entry hazards is helpful as they weaken the opponent into KO range, and it helps weaken the Flying-types that plague Parasect. Whirlipede can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, making it a decent partner. Pokemon that can break through Steel- and Flying-types make it easier for Parasect to sweep; Charizard can hit Steel-types with its STAB, and Probopass can trap Steel-types with Magnet Pull and hit Flying-types with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. Probopass should watch out for Braviary's Superpower, however. Weezing is a more unconventional option, but it can run Fire Blast and Thunderbolt to melt Steel-types and zap birds out of the sky. Finally, as Parasect is slow, make sure you have Pokemon that can switch into its weaknesses. Water-types, such as Alomomola, and Fire-types, such as Camerupt, are great choices.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Unfortunately, Parasect's movepool is poor, and it doesn't have a lot of options left. Bug Bite is a weaker STAB move and it can steal the opponent's Berry, but outside of it's added effect, it's pretty useless. Counter is somewhat gimmicky, but if you can predict correctly, it's a nasty surprise for physical attackers. Giga Drain can be used to restore some of Parasect's HP, but it's largely inferior to Leech Seed. Finally, Growth and Hone Claws raise Parasect's stats, but it's too slow to set them up, and they're outclassed by Swords Dance for the most part.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Flying-types are the number one counter to Parasect. Braviary and Swellow can switch into anything bar Spore and tear it apart with Brave Bird. Steel-types, such as Probopass and Mawile, can switch into any of Parasect's attacking moves, cripple it with status, and wall it for an eternity. Charizard and Camerupt can switch into Parasect relatively easily and threaten it with their STAB moves; however, Camerupt is slow, and without any Speed investment, Parasect can put it to sleep. Parasect relies on physical attacks most of the time, making bulky Pokemon, such as Weezing and Regirock, good checks. Anything that can take an X-Scissor and avoid Spore can be considered a check. Murkrow is immune to Spore, thanks to Insomnia, and a STAB-boosted Brave Bird will KO Parasect with ease. Altaria can switch into any of Parasect's attacks, and thanks to Natural Cure, it will be cured of status upon switching. Magic Bounce Natu can switch into Spore and Leech Seed, but outside of its ability, it can't do much to Parasect. Vileplume is immune to Leech Seed and it can cripple Parasect with Stun Spore; in fact, most Poison-types can take on Parasect, so Skuntank, Whirlipede, Haunter, and Garbodor are good checks. Funnily enough, Parasect can be beaten with a simple Chesto or Lum Berry; Parasect relies on Spore to be effective, and without it, it's as good as dead. Taunt the mushroom and watch it fall.</p>
