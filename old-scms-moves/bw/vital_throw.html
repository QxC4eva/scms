Ignores evasion modifiers.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of -1. Ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Vital Throw would be a decent move that would see some use if Smogon didn't apply the Evasion Clause. Since moves that raise evasion are forbidden in this competitive scene this attack has no reason to be used. Theoretically, if you are concerned about Sand Veil or Snow Cloak abusers this move could come in handy, but even then moves with greater Base Power are more reliable options.</p>
