Moves
========
- Close Combat and Flare Blitz are strong STABs with good coverage.
- Flare Blitz has more power, while Fire Blast is an option if you don't like recoil, and want to do more damage to physically defensive stuff like Skarmory or Forretress.
- Fire Blast also 2HKOs Landorus-T and Gliscor after Stealth Rock.
- HP Ice is useful for Landorus-T, also hits Garchomp, Dragonite and Gliscor the hardest.
- SE Thunder Punch with Iron Fist boost hits marginally harder than neutral STAB. Targets include Gyarados before Mega Evolving, Jellicent, Starmie and Tentacruel, while being best move for Mandibuzz and Keldeo.
- U-turn allows Infernape to scout switch ins and offers a lot of utility.
- Mach Punch has very useful to revenge kill threats like +1 Mega Gyarados, +1 Mega Tyranitar and SD Bisharp, while preventing a speed tie with Terrakion & other 108s.
HP Grass is an option for Rotom-W, and Grass Knot for other waters and Hippowdon.

Set Details
========
- Flare Blitz guarantees 2HKO on Mega-Venasaur after SR, while Fire Blast doesn't.
- 44 SpA EVs guaratees the OHKO on Gliscor, Landorus-I and Dragonite after SR.
- 44 SpA Evs also allows Infernape to 2HKO Gliscor and Lando-T after stealth rock, allowing space for Thunder Punch and U-turn or Mach Punch, making Infernape harder to wall and giving it more utility.
- Iron Fist boosts Mach Punch and Thunder Punch, but Blaze gives a strong finishing Fire move if you're running not running Mach Punch or Thunder Punch.
- Max speed is mandatory to tie other base 108 speed Pokemon like Terrakion and outspeeding Pokemon like Garchomp and positive nature base 100 Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========
- Nice coverage and speed tier allows Infernape to threaten and KO a handful of stuff, but is mostly outclassed by Keldeo.
- Advantages of using Infernape include access to U-turn and Mach punch, giving Infernape a lot more utility. Infernape also has no trouble with Grass-types.
- Recoil makes it easily worn down with passive damage, especially with Flare Blitz.

Team Options
========
- Sun boosts the power of Infernape's Fire-type attacks, Mega Charizard Y can set up sun with Drought.
- Rotom-W resists 3 of Infernape's weaknesses and switches into Talonflame, Azumarill and Mega-Pinsir, who threaten Infernape with SE priority.
- Substitute Kyurem-B with Fusion Bolt and Thundurus-I can deal with bulky Water-types, especially Rotom-W, that Infernape struggles with.
- Late-game sweepers like Mega-Pinsir, Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, Dragon Dance Dragonite, Swords Dance Garchomp, who appreciate Infernape wearing down their checks.

Other Options
########
- Choice Band
- Swords Dance
- Choice Scarf
- Nasty Plot


Checks & Counters
########
- Mega Charizard X, specifically bulky variants. Mega Charizard Y also checks Infernape if it doesn't carry Thunder Punch.
- Hippowdon, but it takes a good chunk of damage from Grass Knot.
- Rotom-W, but it must be wary of HP Grass.
- Mixed walls: Sylveon, Clefable.
- Talonflame, Azumarill and Mega-Pinsir pack SE priority, while the former two resist both STABs.
- Latias, Latios, Thundurus-I, Talonflame, Deoxys-S, Starmie, and Gengar all outspeed Infernape, resist Mach Punch & OHKO.
Bulky Waters: Jellicent, Gyarados, Tentacruel, Slowbro, but dislike Thunder Punch.
