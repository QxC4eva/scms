Overview
########

Ever since the metagame of Doubles was created in BW, Rotom-W has been an amazing glue Pokemon in the metagame. Its outstanding defensive typing leaves it with just a single weakness and a plethora of resistances to common attacking types such Fire, Water, and Flying&mdash;as well as an ability that grants it an immunity to Ground-type attacks. Access to Will-O-Wisp is also a great asset for Rotom-W, as it can neuter threatening physical attackers permanently.

Unfortunately for Rotom-W, its HP and Speed stats are rather lackluster, and faster wallbreakers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Latios can easily break through it. Its offensive coverage is also resisted by both Grass- and Dragon-types.

Special Tank
########
name: Special Tank
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Protect / Electroweb / Light Screen
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 252 HP / 132 SpA / 124 SpD
nature: Modest

Moves
========
This is by far Rotom-W's most consistent set, doing an amazing job at checking or countering various Fire-, Flying-, and Water-types. Hydro Pump is a no brainer on any Rotom-W as it allows it to score solid OHKOs on Landorus-T, Volcarona, and offensive variants of Heatran. Thunderbolt is there for dual STAB as well as hitting Water-types that resist Hydro Pump. It is also more consistent than Hydro Pump due to better accuracy. In the third slot, Will-O-Wisp is a great way to deal with bulky physical attackers such as Scizor, Mega Kangaskhan, and Trevenant. The 4th slot is very varied and all moves have their own unique uses. Protect is an amazing move on any Pokemon in Doubles, as it can scout for moves and play around a predicted offensive strategy. Electroweb is a good way to control Speed for teammates and can also support itself in the fact that Rotom-W itself is slow. Finally, Light Screen is a good way to keep overwhelmingly powerful Special attackers in check as well as overall support the team well.
Set Details
========
Max HP / Max SpA for optimizing the role of a bulky offensive tank.
Different spread of 252 HP / 88 SpA / [rest of evs] SpD with a Calm nature will help Rotom-W tank special attacks better. SpA evs are for OHKOing Landorus-T with pump.
52 Spe EVs works well with Electroweb: outspeed megazard / megakanga after - Speed.
Sitrus Berry is the safer option, and allows it to use Protect
ChestoRest is an option for healing.
Usage Tips
========
Rotom-W is to be used as an offensive glue - it should be able to switch into its teammates' counters and deal a lot of damage back / burn that fuker
It is able to put a stop large amount of Pokemon (most Fire-, Water-, and Flying-types) [list some examples of popular mons here (Tran, landog, burd), and mention how it comfortably tanks SlideQuake, a popular coverage option]
Rotom-W can and should also be used as a status spreader; especially if running WoW, since crippling physical attackers will benefit you throughout the match.
Team Options
========
Steel-types such as Scizor and Metagross make great partners, as they wall Dragon- and Grass-types.
Offensive Fire- and Ice-types such as Heatran and Weavile help take out Grass-type Pokemon that bother Rotom-W. Fire-types even take advantage of their presence, as they often can do nothing in return.
Ground-types synergize well with Rotom-W, as they can freely use Earthquake beside it. Mamoswine special mention, since it takes out Dragon- and Grass-type mons.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Thunderbolt / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Trick / Hidden Power Ice
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 52 HP / 252 SpA / 204 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
Pump is for obvious STAB etc powahful...
Volt Switch is a secondary STAB move, hits waters, and provides momentum.
Thunderbolt acts as a more reliable, more powerful STAB Electric move, and Hidden Power Ice hits Dragons (Latios, Hydreigon, Chomp)
Trick for crippling everything, HP Ice if you decide to run all out attacking.
Set Details
========
Scarf Rotom-w meant to be as fast and powerful as possible, so max SpA / Spe, but with a 50% boost to Speed, a Modest nature will suffice.
EVs outspeeds Shaymin-S after the scarf boost. This will miss out on meganectric and crobat i guess
Will-O-Wisp is an OO for this set to burn fast threats (such as kangas).
Usage Tips
========
faster, offensive Pokemon weak to its STAB moves, such as Landorus-T, MegaZard Y, and Terrakion are main targets, and can either be genereally checked or surprise OHKOd.
crippling supportive Pokemon with Trick is a good use of Scarf - works especially well against TR setters.
Team Options
========
Fire-types are great partners for this Rotom-W. Fire eats grass which shit on rotom, rotom surprise kills the Ground- and Rock-type mons.
Again, Steel types have amazing defensive synergy with it.
Ground-types again, especially Landorus-T, since they form a solid VolTurn core.
Other Options
########
Obvious Choice Specs mention goes here
Assault Vest is definitely a cool item to try out
HP Grass for Gastrodon
Thunder Wave
Pain Split
Checks and Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Grass-types mostly, and some mention of Dragons resisting and hitting back hard neutrally.

**Speed**: Bad HP stat means it takes a shitton of damage from powerful neutral attacks such as Latios Draco Meteor, Mega Kangaskhan Return, Terrakion Close Combat.
