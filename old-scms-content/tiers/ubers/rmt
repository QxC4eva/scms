<p><font size="1"><em>by firecape [Dec. 2010]</em></font></p>
<p>firecape's BARN ALL team has became a trademark kickword which led to many other X All! teams. Utilizing uncommon sets at the time, namely Heatran and Shadow Tag Chandelure, firecape takes DW Ubers to a whole new level. Groudon is there to do its thing: set up Stealth Rock, get the sun shining, and wall physical attackers. In conjuction with Ferrothorn's Spikes, Arceus's sweep is made easier thanks to the additional damage. Chandelure is there as an amazing revenge killer, able to trap and kill everything it needs to, such as opposing Extreme Killer Arceus or Mewtwo. Heatran and Latias patch up the team's weaknesses to Kyogre, Calm Mind Arceus, and Dragon-type attacks.</p>

<p><font size="1"><em>by firecape [Jun. 2011]</em></font></p>
<p>firecape returns again, this time with a say: Moody must be banished from Ubers. firecape built this team to create win conditions specifically for his broken Pokemon&mdash;Bibarel and Octillery. With Roserade's fast Toxic Spikes, Moody's Evasion increase along with Subsitute and Protect can make a man crazy. Roserade's Poison typing is also helpful as it absorbs opposing Toxic Spikes which outstall his Moody Pokemon. Kyogre was needed for the rain it summons and as a viable revenge killer. Wobbuffet defeats opposing Choice Scarf users which could be a pain for firecape's other Pokemon and grants setup oppurtunities for Bibarel and Octillery. Blissey rounds off the team by being a good special wall, a cleric, and a Thunder sponge.</p>

<p>In the end of 2011, a new star was discovered in the Ubers metagame by user Koinzell: <strong>Jynx</strong>. In this RMT shrang exposes Jynx to the world and even teaches us how to use her. Dialga and Skarmory are the team's hazard setters, and they are extremely valuable as they defeat top tier threats such as Palkia and Arceus. Giratina-O makes sure their job is not thrown to waste while also is a great revenger and shuffler, Palkia checks Kyogre and is a phenemonemal Choice Scarf user, while Kyogre brings the much appreciated rain for Jynx, that now restores a lot of health back, and immense power.</p>

<p><font size="1"><em>by Fiction. [Mar. 2012]</em></font></p>
<p>Fiction.'s Guerrila Radio team is not an ordinary sight. His usage of Abomasnow in the Ubers metagame is why. Despite being mediocre overall, Fiction. built his team in a way to take full advantage of hail. Forretress's Toxic Spikes stack a lot of damage on the foe, while also being able to limit switch-ins with Spikes and Rapid Spin opposing hazards away. Forretress's spinning capabilities are not appreciated by Abomasnow only, as Ho-Oh needs Stealth Rock off to to take Fire-type moves aimed at Abomasnow and to take on Calm Mind Arceus and Darkrai. Giratina brings physical bulkiness to the team (which is greatly appreciated against Groudon, Terrakion, and Arceus), Palkia makes a great Choice Scarf user, and Dark Arceus patches the weakness to Mewtwo and brings Stealth Rock to the field.</p>

<p><font size="1"><em>by Poppy [Jul. 2012]</em></font></p>
<p>In Grounded, Poppy takes on hyper offense, which is a different style than what he usually plays with, but he still manages to take it on with his charm. Using the very underrated Ground Arceus and SubSD Terrakion, Poppy creates a high load of pressure on the foe. Dialga and Ferrothorn serve as the team's hazard setters and somewhat of a defensive core, whereas Kyogre and Kabutops are served as revenge killers and late-game cleaners, while Kabutops can also use Rapid Spin effectively.</p>

<h4>BW2</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bwmini/478.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;<strong><a href="/forums/threads/the-unspinnables-peaked-1.3470181/">The Unspinnables</a></strong>
<p><font size="1"><em>by alexwolf [Jul. 2012]</em></font></p>
<p>In The Unspinnables, alexwolf introduces us to somewhat of an uncommon sight: dual Ghost-types, with Froslass being one of them. alexwolf shows us how useful Froslass can be on an offensive team in conjuction with many hard hitting and shufflers, as not only does she lay Spikes easily, she spinblocks at the same time. Groudon is the team's Stealth Rock user, sun summoner, and main check to Zekrom and Excadrill. Giratina-O brings a Ground-type immunity and serves as a reliable spinblocker (once Froslass has fainted) and shuffler. Palkia and Zekrom put offensive momntum and force many switches, and are mainly used to get past Darkrai and Kyogre. Arceus is the team's final sweeper, and with the opponent's team weakened, it can do its job easily.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bwmini/385.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;<strong><a href="/forums/threads/cant-beat-the-classics.3472205/">Can't Beat the Classics</a></strong>
<p><font size="1"><em>by trickroom [Sep. 2012]</em></font></p>
<p>10-1 SPL2 player trickroom returns with another great team. Can't Beat The Classics recognizes many unusual sights: dual-weather, unique movesets, and underrated Pokemon. Skarmory and Jirachi are incredibly underrated in the metagame and trickroom gives back their reputation as phenomenal defensive Steel-types. Both are capable of defeating big threats in Ubers such as Arceus, Mewtwo, Darkrai, Kyurem-W, and more. trickroom popularized the use of Earth Plate Groudon as a stellar Stealth Rock user and mid-game player, and 3 Attacks Latias, which has proven as an extremely viable set. trickroom rounds off the team with a Physically Defensive Giratina-O to help take on Arceus, Terrakion, and Groudon and a bulky Choice Scarf Kyogre, which still hits incredibly hard, but can also take a few hits.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bwmini/450.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;<strong><a href="/forums/threads/elements-of-the-desert-peaked-1.3477020/">Elements of the Desert</a></strong>
<p><font size="1"><em>by Hack He Must [Jan. 2013]</em></font></p>
<p>In Elements of the Desert, Hack He Must comes to tell us that sand stall is a viable playstyle in BW2. Using Hippowdown's massive physical bulk, access to Stealth Rock, Whirlwind, and Slack Off, Hippowdown becomes a fantastic Sand Stream user that can be just as useful as Tyranitar, who is usually preferred. Thanks to Hippowdown's Sand Stream ability, Excadrill can become a fearsome sweeper with its Sand Rush ability. This quality also makes it a viable offensive spinner, and with Air Balloon it checks opposing Gliscor. Ferrothorn checks defensive Kyogre, slows down Pokemon such as Arceus and Mewtwo with Thunder Wave, and sets up Stealth Rock, whereas Giratina checks more offensive-oriented Kyogre and Swords Dance Arceus while also spinblocking. Ho-Oh is a phenomenal check to Calm Mind Arceus, and that's exactly its role on this team, mainly for Fighting Arceus, and Water Arceus is used as the team's Ice-type resist, Dragons check, and special sweeper.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bwmini/386-s.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;<strong><a href="/forums/threads/wakanda.3479159/">Wakanda</a></strong>
<p><font size="1"><em>by Problems [Feb. 2013]</em></font></p>
<p>Problems intorduces us to a team that has served him for a win during the fifth week of SPL4. When you look at the team's glance, you notice something odd: it's a Deoxys-S team, but it's not hyper offense! Problems's use of Deoxys-S remains fairly the same, however. Get up hazard as soon as possible, shuffle a bit, punch some holes with Giratina-O or Latias, and sweep with Steel Arceus or Terrakion. Just that simple. However the innovative Deoxys-S set allows it to also defeat common anti-leads such as Forretress while still punch a few holes with Psycho Boost. Terrakion guards the team from DD Rayquaza and ExtremeKiller Arceus. Latias checks Kyogre while still putting a lot of pressure using the 3 Attacks set, whereas Steel Arceus checks Dragons and Genesect, while being able to potentially sweep. Kyogre checks Calm Mind Arceus and Darkrai with ease, spreads Scald burns, and phazes.</p>

<p><font size="1"><em>by trickroom [Feb. 2013]</em></font></p>
<p>ATTN: THIS TEAM IS COMPETITIVE. The appreances by Archeops (now ex-member), Honchkrow, or Lead Skarmory may be deceiving, but don't worry, we all have fallen for it. trickroom proves us that competitive Pokemon can still be fun by creating a theme of birds only! Of course this creates a few weakness to threats like Zekrom or Terrakion, but trickroom still gets his team to work just fine. Skarmory kicks off the match with dual hazards, Taunt, and Whirlwind. Giratina-O makes sure Terrakion will not break the team apart and secures the hazards down. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S is a great anti-meta Pokemon that is capable of beating Deoxys-S, Darkrai, Kyogre, Rayquaza, and more. Latios puts a ton of offensive pressure on the foe while checking Kyogre, and Honchkrow is actually the team's nuke with Moxie, and can also revenge with Sucker Punch.</p>

<p><font size="1"><em>by Go10 [Apr. 2013]</em></font></p>
<p>In Dark War, Go10 brings us his revamped BW1 bulky offense team. His team contains a few odd sets, which catches the eye immediately: bulky Deoxys-S, bulky Rock Polish Groudon, and bulky Calm Mind Mewtwo. Using the bulk and his Pokemon high Speed stat, Go10 maintains a fast paced game and a lot of momentum by setting up hazards early game with Deoxys-S and nuking with Rayquaza. No spinblocker makes spinners annoying, but all of Go10's Pokemon have a move to hit them with. Palkis serves as a revenge killer and Kyogre check, Groudon is a bulky booster that can tank strong attacks like Outrage and setup, whereas Arceus and Mewtwo are the late game cleaners, with their brute force, coverage, and setup moves.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bwmini/493.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;<strong><a href="/forums/threads/wolfpack.3482600/">Wolfpack</a></strong>
<p><font size="1"><em>by Furai [Apr. 2013]</em></font></p>
<p>2013's SPL winner Furai wanted to celebrate his team's victory with the RMT of one of his favorites. Offensive teams are Furai's favorite archetype so it comes at no surprise that this is exactly what Wolfpack is. This team was centered around CM Ground Arceus, an underrated but effective set. Tyranitar was added as a partner to provide Pursuit support so that Ground Arceus wouldn't have any issues with Latios or Latias. Forretress adds Spikes to the Stealth Rock support Tyranitar provides as well as Rapid Spin to have more control over the hazards game. It's only logical that with all the hazards support Giratina-O would be added for spin blocking as well as to patch up holes concerning Shaymin-S and Ho-Oh. Ghost Arceus is a dangerous threat to offensive teams and Specially Defensive Kyogre is one of the best checks to the beast. All that was left for this team was to find a revenge killer and a Kyogre check, both of which are roles filled by Choice Scarf Palkia.</p>

<p><font size="1"><em>by Fireburn [May 2013]</em></font></p>
<p>The retired Ubers moderator Fireburn makes his comeback with an RMT. In Cold Wave, Fireburn demonstrates us that a rain stall team with a nuke can infact still work. By getting a lot of damage with the insanely powerful Kyurem-W, Fireburn makes it easier for his team to stall the remains of the foe with Toxic Spikes which are brought by Tentacruel, who also spins opposing hazards. Jirachi guards the team from threats such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Kyurem-W, Grass Arceus is used as a support Pokemon that is capable of checking both Palkia and Kyogre, which would otherwise be able to destroy Cold Wave completely. Giratina counters most phyiscal attackers and spinblocks, whereas Kyogre revenge kills and summons the rain.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bwmini/487-o.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;<strong><a href="/forums/threads/big-brazilian-boys-2073.3485544/">Big Brazilian Boys</a></strong>
<p><font size="1"><em>by -Manaphy-- [Jul. 2013]</em></font></p>
<p>Big Brazillian Boys brings the underrated defensive core of Jirachi and Grass Arceus to recognition. The duo checks and can beat the vast majority of the Uber tier, such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, Kyogre, Palkia, Kyurem-W and more. Jirachi supports the team with Wish, which is greatly appreciated, as four Pokemon have no recovery at all. Dialga puts offensive pressure with its STAB Draco Meteors and immense bulk while also setting up Stealth Rock, whereas Giratina-O ensures they remain while breaking stall. Choice Specs Kyogre is used to weaken Kabutops's, the late game cleaner and spinner, counters, such as Giratina-O and Ferrothorn.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bwmini/205.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;<strong><a href="/forums/threads/berry-offensive.3487641/">Berry Offensive</a></strong>
<p><font size="1"><em>by blackstardust [Aug. 2013]</em></font></p>
<p>Berry Offensive is a great example of an offensive rain team which makes use of Custap Forretress's ability to anti-lead and get up a lot of hazards early game. Forretress brings Spikes and Toxic Spikes, whereas Dialga brings Stealth Rock and checks specially oriented attackers. Kyogre and Forretress's Toxic Spikes guard the team from Calm Mind Arceus formes while also racking up hazard damage with Roar. Giratina-O can spread Will-O-Wisp which can be helpful versus physical attackers such as Extreme Killer Arceus or Terrakion while also spinblocks, Genesect buys momentum and checks Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Rayquaza, and last, Palkia just wrecks with its insane power and coverage.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bwmini/91.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;<strong><a href="/forums/threads/droughtfest-the-choice-of-a-new-generation.3488970/">Droughtfest</a></strong>
<p><font size="1"><em>by Hack He Must [Sept. 2013]</em></font></p>
<p>Droughtfest has pretty much become the standard hyper offense sun team, and it is all thanks to Hack He Must, who decided to popularize Poppy's lead Cloyster set. He identified the potential in a Pokemon that can KO all spinblockers, setup a smash or Spikes, and also spin hazards away, and decided to roll with it. Hack decided that Ho-Oh greatly appreciates Cloyster's qualities, and he went with that. He picked Groudon to boost Ho-Oh's Choice Banded Sacred Fires while also setting up Stealth Rock and checking Zekrom, and Palkia as an offensive check to Kyogre which can put a ton of pressure on the foe. Genesect is the team's revenge killer and handles the faster threats of Ubers, whereas Ghost Arceus checks Extreme Killer Arceus and is a secondary win condition.</p>

<p><font size="1"><em>by blackstardust [Ot. 2013]</em></font></p>
<p>blackstardust returns with a unique team style: Trick Room. No, not the user, the move. He has seen the potential in combining Victini + a Dragon-type Pokemon, and he chose Dialga. They both defeat each other's checks and counters, such as Dialga beating Giratina who would otherwise wall Victini. Groudon kicks off with the sun which makes Victini's V-create much more scary and brings Stealth Rock. Palkia absorbs sleep, handles Kyogre, and is the team's revenge killer, whereas Giratina-O plays mindgames with Steel-type Pokemon, especially hazard ones, such as Forretress or Ferrothorn, with Magic Coat and Hidden Power Fire. Dark Arceus eleiminates Pokemon Dialga or Victini cannot setup a Trick Room against, such as Ghost Arceus or Lugia, while also being a secondary win condition and a stallbreaker.</p>
