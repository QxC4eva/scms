[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Forces the target out, dragging out another random non-fainted ally. Fails if the opponent's team does not contain any inactive Pokemon. Fails if the target used Ingrain previously or has the ability Suction Cups. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. This move has a priority of -6. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Whirlwind is an excellent move on almost any Pokemon that gets it. It is nearly impossible to set up against a Pokemon with Whirlwind, such as Skarmory. Whirlwind is able to phaze through Substitutes and is not blocked by Soundproof. Whirlwind, like all phazing moves, is best used with plenty of entry hazard support as it can gradually wear out opponents by forcing them to take entry hazard damage with every switch in. Whirlwind is also a useful move for phazing out set-up sweepers and halting sweeps. It can also break Baton Pass chains in the lower tiers that rely on Soundproof Mr. Mime to block Roar.</p>
