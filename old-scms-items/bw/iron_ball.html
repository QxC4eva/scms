Reduces Speed 50% and removes holder's Ground-type immunity.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cuts the holder's Speed by 50% and negates all the holder's immunities to Ground-type moves, including Levitate and the Flying-type. Rotom-S is not an exception. The holder is also made susceptible to Arena Trap, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. A Flying-type Pok√©mon holding an Iron Ball will receive neutral damage from Ground-type moves regardless of its secondary type.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Iron Ball is not exactly the best item to hold for most Pokemon&mdash;the Speed decrease and susceptibility to Ground-type attacks are almost never a good thing (unless you're running a Trick Room team, of course, but there are still better options to lower Speed, such as a Macho Brace). However, Iron Ball does have some utility if it can be Tricked onto the opponent. A notable user of this tactic is Metagross, which can lure in opponents such as Skarmory and Rotom-W and force the Iron Ball onto them, hopefully picking up Leftovers or some other useful item in the process. They are then susceptible to Metagross's Earthquake, with Rotom-W in particular taking super effective damage from it.</p>

<p>Either that, or if you are seriously ballsy you can give this item to Gengar in order to allow it to absorb Toxic Spikes. Some people do, apparently.</p>
