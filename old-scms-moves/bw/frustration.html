<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The move's Base Power is dependent upon the user's current happiness. The calculation for Base Power is as follows:</p>

<p>Base Power = (255 - Happiness) / 2.5, rounded down.</p>

<p>The Base Power can be anywhere between 0 and 102. On simulators that do not factor in happiness, it is always assumed as 102.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Frustration is useless on cartridge trained Pokemon, as it is nearly impossible to raise them to high levels while maintaining a low happiness rating. Return should be used in these cases, as trained Pokemon can easily reach and maintain maximum happiness. On a battle simulator, however, one can easily set the user's happiness to 0, and it is the default setting in Pokemon Online's teambuilder, making Frustration an acceptable alternative.</p>

<p>As it stands, Frustration serves the same purpose as Return as the staple STAB attack of physical Normal-type attackers. A 102 Base Power STAB attack with no drawbacks is a huge blessing to physical Normal-type sweepers, including Sawsbuck, Tauros, Ambipom, Staraptor, and many others. Though outside of Normal-types, Frustration is rarely seen due to its otherwise poor coverage and lack of secondary effect. Unfortunately for the said Normal-types, Steel-types are almost ubiquitous in today's OU metagame, and the last thing any team wants to do is give them any more safe switch ins than they already get, relegating Normal-types and Return/Frustration to the lower tiers. In the lower tiers, RU and NU in particular, there are few viable Steel- and Ghost-types, meaning a STAB-boosted Frustration has much greater viability and relative power to blow through teams.</p>
