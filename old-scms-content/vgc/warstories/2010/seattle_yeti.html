<p>After beating some kid's beloved Mamoswine round 1, I proceeded to the entryway for the second round. I glanced about to see where the other Ducks were, hoping to avoid facing one of them so soon.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I was led to my own station and waited for my next opponent.</p>

<p>It was a young boy, 10-14 years old I'd say. He was on a high from winning one round and eagerly awaiting his next match.</p>

<p>We kneeled down on the floor to begin the match. It was inconvenient to stand so everyone just sat down instead.</p>

<p>Out came my leads, shimmering on the screen. Out came his, much less impressive.</p>

<p>He was star-struck by the shiny team he was facing.</p>

<p>He led with a Scizor and Garchomp. I sighed, "another noob who uses OU singles mons."</p>

<p>I debated who to Fake Out first. In the end, I decided to FO his Scizor, allowing the one, the only, SCARFOGRE, to surf into action.</p>

<p>His Scizor was rendered useless. He didn't seem phased by it, however, and waited to undoubtedly strike back.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the sheer raw power of YOU LOSE the pink-purple whale overwhelmed him. First Garchomp saw its HP drop like there was no tomorrow. It dropped to 0, and the Chomp was down for the count.</p>

<p>Then it sliced his Scizor, dragging its already-diminished HP to nonexistent as well.</p>

<p>He was left dazed and confused. In one turn, both his leads were gone. One Ogre had swept him away, literally.</p>

<p>But he sent in his backup, a slight smirk emerging on his face in anticipation.</p>

<p>Lucario, who I had decimated in round 1, and............ Luxray.</p>

<p>-_-</p>

<p>I contemplated my options. Switch Ogre out to avoid taking what was sure to be a OHKO from Luxray, or trust its Scarf to outspeed that schmuck.</p>

<p>Hitmontop was less of a decision&mdash;even if he lost his life, I had enough backup to cover for him.</p>

<p>But since he was SUPERCOOL he stayed in, OHKOing Lucario without a sweat.</p>

<p>My Hitmontop is in the top percentage of all Hitmontop.</p>

<p>YOU LOSE roared mightily. Once again, a full HP Water Spout loomed over my opponent's head.</p>

<p>He didn't seem concerned&mdash;surely the Spout would not be significant enough to kill his LUXRAY!!</p>

<p>I didn't even see what happened. I looked behind me to see where zerowing and the other Mighty Ducks were at, hoping none of them were waiting for opponents or I'd have to ask to not fight them.</p>

<p>I heard the death cry of a Pokemon and glanced back at the screens. His Luxray went down, one hit taking it to a watery grave.</p>

<p>The only damage I had sustained was TOPPERCENT's own Life Orb.</p>

<p>He dropped his head and slowly signed off, accepting his defeat.</p>

<p>In two turns, his beloved but weak Pokemon had been decimated.</p>

<p>And I walked on to tell the guy standing at the gateway to the next round not to make me fight zerowing and watched as Huy (or Duy I wasn't paying much attention) said the same thing soon after.</p>

<p>fyi this warstory is sort of for anyone wondering what the first couple rounds will be like.</p>
