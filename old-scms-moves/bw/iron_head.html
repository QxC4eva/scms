<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While Iron Head is a well rounded move, Steel is a poor attacking type. Therefore, Iron Head is rare. The only common user of this move is Jirachi, whose Serene Grace ability doubles the move's flinch chance to 60%. Subsequently, Iron Head becomes an extremely useful move, able to flinch slower (or paralyzed) foes multiple times, which can result in KOes. Iron Head Jirachi frequently carries a means of paralysis, and is able to outspeed and threaten an absurd number of Pokemon with this strategy.</p>
