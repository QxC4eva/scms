<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All targeted moves used by the opponent target the user, regardless of the intended target. This effect is only applicable in double, triple, and multi-battles. This does not affect moves which hit multiple Pokemon, or Pursuit if the intended target switches out. In triple battles, this move only affects moves from adjacent opponents, unless a non-adjacent opponent uses a move that can target non-adjacent Pokemon, such as Air Slash. This move has a priority of +3.</p>

<p>If a Pokemon with the ability Lightningrod and a Pokemon using Rage Powder are out at the same time, and a Pokemon uses an Electric attack targeted at the Rage Powder user's team, Rage Powder will take precedence and absorb the attack. If a Pokemon with the ability Storm Drain and a Pokemon using Rage Powder are out at the same time, and a Pokemon uses a Water attack targeted at the Rage Powder user's team, Rage Powder will take precedence and absorb the attack. Rage Powder will take precedence and redirect attacks before Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce take effect.</p>

<p>If both enemies use Rage Powder in the same round, moves will target whichever Pokemon used Rage Powder second. Rage Powder fails if not used in a double or triple battle.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rage Powder is useless in single battles. In doubles, however, it is extremely useful for giving one Pokemon a free turn during which it cannot be targeted by any of the opposing side's attacks. This allows strategies such as Trick Room to be more easily employed, as well as possibly saving a sweeping teammate from an otherwise fatal attack. Common users of the move include Amoonguss and Volcarona, both of which sport fantastic bulk, as well as wide movepools.</p>
