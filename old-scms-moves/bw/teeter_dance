<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Confuses the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This is the best non-damaging confusion move in the game (though admittedly that's not saying much). Teeter Dance is a 100% accuracy move that induces confusion to any Pokemon, unless they have the ability Own Tempo or are protected by Safeguard. Very few battlers will use it, since it's not appealing for trainers to bet on a 50% chance for the target not to attack. In this fast and offensive metagame, there is simply not enough time for it to provide a return on the turns taken to use it, especially as the target can always just switch out. Generally, it is preferably to use something like Machamp's DynamicPunch, which not only does damage but also keeps offensive momentum.</p>
