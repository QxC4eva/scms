<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/431.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Drifblim</strong> @ Flying Gem<br />
Ability: Unburden<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Acrobatics<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Disable</p>

<p>Drifblim has to be one of the most disruptive Pokemon in NU. It is a spin-blocker, sweeper and lure all in one: like SubDisable Gengar, except on steroids. Thanks to Unburden, Acrobatics acts as a 110 Base Power STAB Agility. It can OHKO or 2HKO most of the metagame. The few Pokemon that can stop it, namely Rock and Steel types, are left crippled by Will-O-Wisp. What's even better is that thanks to its unique typing, Disable can force a lot of switches; with a few layers of hazards the residual damage can rack up very quickly. I prefer this set to the Destiny Bond variant because it can much more reliably lure Swellow's counters and beat them without sacrificing itself. Bulky special Electric types with BoltBeam coverage is probably the only reliable counter to Drifblim.</p>

<p>I decided to give it maximum Speed because it sits in the pretty crucial Base 80 speed tier. It guarantees to outspeed Absol, Ludicolo, Samurott, and tie with Braviary and Gardevoir before Unburden which allows it to set up on these threats in a pinch.</p>

<p><strong>Probopass</strong> @ Air Balloon<br />
Ability: Magnet Pull<br />
EVs: 24 HP / 252 SpA / 232 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Flash Cannon<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Volt Switch</p>

<p>Don't worry, your eyes have not deceived you - Probopass packs surprising power and speed. If Probopass can get a massive hit on Golem on Turn 1 then often I may have already won the game because the opponent is unlikely to have another counter to my double birds. With Magnet Pull, Probopass can trap and eliminate opposing Probopass and Bastiodon, the two hardest counters to Drifblim and Swellow, clearing the way for an easy sweep later.</p>

<p>Countering Rock and Steel types isn't just what this Probo can do though, it has a fantastic typing that leaves many Pokemon helpless against it thanks to Balloon. It offers great support to Serperior too by beating Armaldo, Skuntank, Garbodor and most Poison types. Unlike defensive spreads, Flash Cannon and Earth Power has no trouble breaking Subs to prevent it being set up on. Another aspect of Probopass that is perfect with this team is that if it gets KOed it gives me momentum, if it doesn't get KOed the slow Volt Switch will still give me momentum regardless - perfect for hyper offence.</p>

<p>The Speed EVs are very specific, 191 Speed outspeeds neutral Golem but underspeeds all variants of Gorebyss. This means that I can Volt Switch after Gorebyss makes its move, allowing me to bring in the appropriate counter no matter what happens.</p>

<p><strong>Garbador</strong> @ Black Sludge<br />
Ability: Stench<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 244 Def / 16 SpD<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Rock Blast<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Clear Smog</p>

<p>Garbodor is a very good Spiker. NU is infested with Sawk and Gurdurr who are prime set up opportunities for Garbodor. Garbodor also matches well against most spinners, the most common one Armaldo straight up loses to Garbodor while Cryogonal is hit for massive damage by Rock Blast and has a chance to be OHKOed. Rock Blast beats Ninjask leads which is also very important and its Poison typing helps absorb Toxic Spikes which is very useful against stall. Garbodor is so reliable at Spiking in fact I end most matches with 3 layers of Spikes. Probopass also forms an awesome mini core with Garbodor, the two can continually switch in to each other's threats and either lay Spikes in Garbodor's case or keep momentum with Volt Switch in Probopass's case. Their common weakness actually helps to lure Ground type attacks for Drifblim, Serperior and Swellow to grab easy switches.</p>

<p>I really wanted to use Gunk Shot but it renders Garbodor helpless against a lot of very dangerous threats. I chose Toxic as its main attacking option instead and it has worked well so far at crippling common switch-ins such as Musharna, Gardevoir and Golem. Clear Smog is a great move as it prevents Garbodor being set up on and allows it to hard counter Gurdurr.</p>

<p>The 16 Speed EVs ensure Garbodor outspeeds neutral Golem, guaranteeing at the very least two layers of Spikes if I choose to lead with it.</p>

<p><strong>Samurott</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Torrent<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Aqua Jet<br />
- Megahorn</p>

<p>I've said a lot about Samurott before but it just keeps getting better. At +2, Waterfall OHKOes many bulky threats while it has Aqua Jet for anything that outspeeds it. Megahorn is a fantastic coverage move and allows it to beat Tangela, Shelgon, Amoonguss and Vileplume with the help of hazards. The item choice is another thing that Samurott really loves; Lum Berry lets it beat Misdreavus, Weezing and any other physical wall that relies on Will-O-Wisp. It even gives Samurott a very good chance to beat Alomomola. I'm starting to sound like a broken record but what makes it even better is its ability, Torrent, coupled with its bulk, which seemingly is tailored to let it go into Torrent range with just about every powerful attack. A Torrent boosted +2 Waterfall is lethal, and Torrent boosted Aqua Jet secures KOes on the likes of Braviary, Electabuzz, Gardevoir often after just one layer of SR. Basically, Samurott has the perfect blend of power, coverage, bulk, speed, ability and movepool - the only things that really hard counter it are Quagsire and Frillish. </p>

<p>I use Jolly Nature because I discovered it still secures all the OHKOes it needs, while severely punishing Pokemon such as Absol, Ludicolo, Skuntank and opposing Samurott that don't have enough speed (which is all of themâ€¦).</p>

<p><strong>Serperior</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Overgrow<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Hidden Power Rock</p>

<p>Serperior acts as yet another set up sweeper. What it lacks in power it makes up for in speed and longevity. Not that it lacks much power - after one Calm Mind, Serperior is capable of OHKOing Magmortar and Braviary after Stealth Rock. As a measure of its bulk Serperior can take a Close Combat in its stride from Scarf Sawk while OHKOing back with Giga Drain and healing itself up again. At +1 it survives LO Cryogonal's Ice Beam and OHKOes back with Overgrow boosted Giga Drain. Serperior seems to be another Pokemon that has a perfect bulk to abuse its fantastic ability. It is an excellent check to Samurott and most things that beat Drifblim and my own Samurott. Taunt allows it to auto-win any CM wars and prevents phazing; not to mention the general utility of a fast Taunt to prevent hazards or other kinds of set up and makes Serperior another good option to lead.</p>

<p>Maximum speed is prefered to tie with opposing Serperior and try to Taunt them before they move. Maximum special attack with Life Orb secures some very crucial OHKOes that allow Serperior to sweep, while the LO recoil actually helps to bring Serperior into Overgrow range in time to drop a nuclear Giga Drain.</p>

<p><strong>Swellow</strong> @ Toxic Orb<br />
Ability: Guts<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Facade<br />
- Brave Bird<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Quick Attakc</p>

<p>Swellow provides the speed and the power to finish matches the old fashioned way. I don't think anything in the tier can take on Guts boosted Swellow 1v1 that isn't a Rock or Steel type. Practically everything is OHKOed or 2HKOed. I can afford to have Quick Attack instead of Protect because of the slow Volt Switch from Probopass which gets Swellow in safely. Quick Attack helps Swellow avoid Sucker Punch from Absol and Skuntank as well as finishing off weakened Scarf 'mons such as Rotom-S. If Drifblim and the rest of the team have done their jobs properly then the opponent's team should be in a pretty shattered state, especially if a lot of hazards are up.</p>

<p>Maximum speed Swellow outspeeds the majority of the tier. Pokemon such as Cincinno, Floatzel and Zebstrika that fall outside of Serperior's net are easily caught by Swellow and OHKOed. Once Rocks and Steels are gone, Swellow can often end the game there and then.</p>
