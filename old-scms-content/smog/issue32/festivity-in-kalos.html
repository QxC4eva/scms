<h2>Chingling Bells: Christmas in Kalos</h2>

<p>It's that time of year: everyone is full of holiday spirit in anticipation for holidays and the new year. This spirit is embodied by our traditions. Everybody has a different tradition of celebrating the holidays and their time with loved ones. Families are reuniting. Decorations are being hung. Parties are being organized. What better way to embody this spirit than to try dramatically outdoing your neighbors and coworkers with some Kalos festivity?</p>


<h2>The Music</h2>

<p><strong>Exploud / Loudred / Whismur<br />
Chimecho / Chingling</strong></p>

<p>Famous for their gaping mouths a toned tenors, the Whismur line is sure to bring happiness and joy to each festive Christmas celebration&mdash;at least until they start singing Miley Cyrus. All about the festive spirit, they go around town singing popular winter hits, such as "Chingle Bell Rock," "Nosepass, the Red-Nosed Rock-type," and "Rockin' Around the Christmas Abomasnow," spreading the cheer. While their performance is nice to listen to, it is advised to keep your distance from Exploud, a heavy drinker who hasn't recovered from his hangover and whose breath reeks of eggnog and celebratory wine; that gaping mouth and foggy breath doesn't help at all.</p>

<p>Don't forget about your bells, which ring continuously throughout the season, bringing festive joy until the elderly get tired of the racket and start throwing household objects. Chimecho and Chingling are known for their unique breeding seasons, massing in number during the winter seasons and then selling for cheap prices at local supermarkets during the spring, when people no longer care about jingling bells. It's said that during the winter seasons, you can hear their bell ringing especially well in their natural habitat, the dense forest. I guess that if you dig that kind of fun, you can go catch one yourself, but the weather outside is frightful, so I'm staying by the fireplace.</p>

<h2>The Decorations</h2>

<p><strong>Abomasnow<br />
Staryu / Starmie<br />
Chinchou / Lanturn<br />
Bellossom</strong></p>

<p>There's nothing more important than a great big Christmas tree, especially if it's bigger than your neighbor's. Abomasnow also has the added benefit of bringing snow! It's the perfect mix of festivity, pine scent, Christmas decoration, snow in your living room, and a massive pine needle mess to clean up afterwards! Who wouldn't want one? Unfortunately, they cost quite a lot during the winter seasons, so it's best to test your skills and catch one yourself to show off. If Abomasnow simply isn't for you, I bet your up-to-date local supermarket still has some cheap Halloween decorations still laying around (I mean, Halloween was just three months ago now), so you can buy a Christmas Trevenant, if you like that kind of style. They should be located between the Thanksgiving placemats and back-to-school equipment.</p>

<p>To make your tree look even better, topping it with a neat Star Pokemon. Staryu and Starmie are perfect, provided that you remember to feed them. Their core gem has the added benefit of shining without requiring battery, so they're also great for the environment. Unfortunately, they are quite a hassle to care for and aren't cheap; this is especially true for the shiny Starmies. Hanging them up is also quite difficult, especially if you have a taller tree; god knows how people decorate those things.</p>

<p>Lights are quite important, too, as they bring out the true majesty and better-than-yours factor of the tree. Real lights are expensive and nobody wants to spend that kind of money. Here in the Pokemon world, humans can utilize the natural light emitted by their Pokemon. Also, instead of pesky electricity cords and one overheating socket to plug it in with, you don't need anything but a tall ladder so you can feed the Pokemon while they're up there, unless you don't want to do that either. Either way, Chinchou and Lanturn can easily light up your tree with their bright, yellow colors, and their lights last for days. A Bellossom or two (or a hundred, as your tree is the biggest in the neighborhood, right?) scattered around the tree is sure to bring color and joy to the world. You simply can't do without them.</p>


<h2>The Presents</h2>

<p><strong>Golett / Golurk<br />
Pawniard / Bisharp</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, the best part about the holidays are giving getting presents. Ahem. What better gift to send to a young relative than a neat Pokemon toy? The Golett and Pawniard line toys make for great presents. Children love the design of the Pokemon, and they're great with children, at least as long as you cover up the sharp blades (it is irrelevant that they make up the entire body of Pawniard and Bisharp).</p>

<p>Wait, you know I meant replicas, right? Pokemon should never be used for toys. I can't believe you even thought I was implying that. What kind of fiend would utilize Pokemon in the place of something as degrading as a common everyday object?</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>During the holidays, it's best to spend time with family and friends&mdash;and Pokemon! Whether it be singing loud carols and waking your neighbors up, buying the largest tree in town and decking it with lights bright enough to keep everyone up at night, or giving sharp, piercing toys to your loved ones, keeping tradition is very important this time of year. Be sure to express your festivity and traditions this holiday season.</p>

<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
