more bulky than Meowth
+3 priority is helpful for out-priority-ing other pokes (yes, I know that's not a real word)

ability: Pickup
item: Life Orb
evs: 76 HP / 196 Atk / 236 Spe

Moves
========
Return is strongest move and hits really hard
Knock Off hits Misdreavus and Gastly and just about everything else you want it to hit, and it hits hard
hurts Aipom's counters by removing their Eviolites and Berry Juices
U-Turn for some damage on the switch
Low Sweep OHKOs Pawniard after Fake Out and is nice to slow things switching inTaunt makes it a perfect anti-lead, preventing hazards or setting up
Fake Out has solid +3 priority
Taunt allows Aipom to be an effective lead, preventing hazards from the likes of Dwebble and Tirtouga
also prevents setup from pokes like tirtouga or shellder

Set Details
========

EVs and Nature give max Attack and put it in that cool 19 Speed tier
The rest goes in HP for that teensy-weensy bit of extra bulk
Pickup is the only Ability that can do anything
In the absurdly improbable case that Aipom stays in for and survives something's Knock Off, Pickup can sometimes grab it a Berry Juice or something else.

Usage Tips
========

Knock off helps weaken its counters by ridding them of their eviolites or berry juices
can be used to gain momentum, but should not be used as part of a VoltTurn combo since it's very frail and can't switch in much
Aipom has bad defenses, so it's best to switch out against something it can't win 1v1, like Slowpoke or bulky Mienfoo etc.
using Fake Out, Taunt, and U-turn together make Aipom an effective lead, but in this metagame, a designated lead is an unwise choice
vulnerable to priority, so watch out for those, Timburr, Croagunk, and Murkrow especially

Team Options
========

Aipom causes a lot of switches, so hazard support from Dwebble or Ferroseed to rack up chip damage is appreciated
burn support is nice so Aipom doesn't have to switch in on a powerful physical attack; only a weak one--Misdreavus is good, absorbing the Fighting-type attacks Aipom draws
Timburr and Mienfoo beat Pawniard
Spritzee beats all Fighting-types
Fletchling has a strong Acrobatics to scare out Timburr and Mienfoo and Croagunk

Other Options
########
a set with only Fake Out and Last Resort is funny, but walled by too many things
Normal Gem + Fake Out + Acrobatics is cool
a Baton Pass set could work, but Aipom is too frail to use it effectively
Thunderpunch also exists
Doubleslap or Fury Swipes with Skill Link is weaker than Return
this thing gets bounce somehow; hits Fighting-types, but it's easy to work around
nice special movepool with Nasty Plot, but low SpA
can Baton Pass Nasty Plot and Agility boosts
Gunk Shot maims Spritzee and has massive surprise factor
Hone Claws is fun, but little time to set it up
T-wave, but that's better left to other pokes
Seed Bomb for Tirtouga, not much else
Choice + Switcheroo is cool
weather setter, but that's better left to other pokes


Checks & Counters
########
Slowpoke can take a hit and T-Wave or attack with STAB Scald or Psychic
Pawniard resists all but Low Sweep and has Sucker Punch or sets up
Foongus can take anything and Spore
Bulky Mienfoo and timburr can take a few hits and hit back hard
priority beats Aipom down after it has taken a few hits because of its awful defenses, so Meditite, Murkrow, Timburr (can absorb hits, too), Tirtouga (has Sturdy and Berry Juice to even set up on), Fletchling, etc.
any Scarfer outspeeds and KOs because of such bad defenses
Spritzee is a big fat annoying blob that walls Aipom
rock types: lileep, tirtouga, dwebble (neutral to Low Sweep)
