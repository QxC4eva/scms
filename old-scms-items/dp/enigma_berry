<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While the Enigma Berry sounds fantastic at a glance, being able to heal 25% after being struck by a super effective attack, in practice it is far too situational to see any use in competitive play. In most cases, your Pokemon will be hit by neutral attacks far more than super effective attacks, and as a good player, you should be avoiding situations where your Pokemon encounters a super effective attack in the first place. It should also be noted that the health gain happens after the Pokemon is hit, which means it must be at full health to ensure it doesn't faint from the attack and to make any kind of use out of this Berry.</p>
