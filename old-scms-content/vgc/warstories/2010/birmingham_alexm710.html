<p>The story begins a week ago when I actually just realise the VGC was so soon. I go crazy and get A LOT of help from my friend.</p>

<p>My team was not ready until 2 am, after SRing and EVing Andrei did the last hurdle for me and I got my team completed.</p>

<h2>The VGC Day</h2>

<p>But wait, before I set off I realise I forgot to get my items put on to Heart Gold, I just traded the items from my Platinum over to my Heart Gold and then I set off.</p>

<p>10:30am and my journey begins in the car, without traffic it should take 1 and a half hours to get there and I have to be there by 1:00pm. But of course, my luck *bleep*ing huge traffic throughout the whole of the motorway and it ends up taking me 3 hours.</p>

<p>I quickly rush out of the car and get there, people were all outside the VGC building and I was wondering why. They wouldn't let 1/4 of us in -_-
Eventually I get in (in a big squeeze) but then the *bleep*ing staff say, "Sorry guys but you have 0 chance of competing this year, we got way too many people than expected". Nearly everyone got turned away but I sneaked inside.</p>

<p>Now was the trouble was getting into the queue of the registration (only half the people inside got to get in the queue). But I failed and got spotted by some staff not in Pokémon uniform :(</p>

<p>Right now I was really pissed off so I just decided to to wonder around the VGC. I played a bit of Pokémon Rumble on the wii (demo) and then played some guy with the VGC rules it was the common Hitmontop-Kyogre lead which won zerowing the Seattle VGC.</p>

<p>Now I thought I'd whip out my video camera and start recording some battles for YouTube, but of course...I forgot to charge my camera which made me even more pissed off.</p>

<p>By this time I was so angry I left whilst the tourney was still going on and then half way back it hit me..I forgot to collect the shiny Eevee there...I was literally tearing my hair out there.</p>

<p>So that was my freaking fail day. If you wanted to know my team here it was...</p>
