<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a high critical hit rate.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Despite its poor Base Power, its main user, Persian, has a 100% critical hit rate with it, so it's an incredible wallbreaking attack that can go through all Reflect users. No defense boost will stop this attack from 2HKOing Alakazam and 3HKOing Chansey. Other than that, it's outclassed by Double-Edge and Body Slam on slower Pokemon.</p>
