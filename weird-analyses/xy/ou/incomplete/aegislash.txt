    ########

        Amazing bulk and power, and thus great tank
        Great wallbreaker
        Good boosting moves in Swords Dance and Autotomize, allowing it to take a sweeping role
        Checks a ton of Pokemon
        Has priority and King's Shield to check physical attackers
        Good spinblocker
        Slow
        It is weak to common offensive types, namely Fire and Ground. Furthermore, Earthquake, the most common physical Ground-type attack, doesn't activate King's Shield's Attack-dropping effect.
        It is reliant on King's Shield to go into Shield forme, which can be taken advantage of.


    Tank
    ########
    name: Tank
    move 1: Shadow Ball
    move 2: Sacred Sword
    move 3: Shadow Sneak / Iron Head
    move 4: King's Shield
    ability: Stance Change
    item: Leftovers
    nature: Quiet
    evs: 240 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 12 Spe

    Moves
    ========

        Shadow Ball is the nuke of this set, everything else on the set is a means of assisting it
        Sacred Sword covers Heatran, Excadrill, Tyranitar, Bisharp, Mega Lucario, Greninja, and Blissey
        Iron Head takes care of most Fairy-types and 2HKOes Tyranitar
        Shadow Sneak can be used over Sacred Sword or Iron Head, depending on your team's needs, and is useful for picking off frail offensive Pokemon and getting 2HKOed against Pokemon that siwtch into you when combined with Shadow Ball. Shadow Sneak is also good to 2HKO Deo-S leads after hitting them with Shadow Ball
        King's Shield is a must to be able to change formes reliably and check a ton of physical attackers


    Set Details
    ========

        The EV spread play Aegislash to its strengths, making it a great tank that can take a lot of damage and hit back hard
        4 SpD EVs to not give a SpA boost to Genesect
        12 Spe EVs outrun 0 Spe Tyranitar and 240 HP EVs give a Lefties number
        Do i really need to explain why Lefties is there?
        SpA is maxed instead of Atk as Shadow Ball is the main source of damage, while the physical attacks do their job even with no investment. Also, a Quite nature is used to no jeopardize Aegislash's bulk or power
        Shadow Sneak + Iron Head + Sacred Sword + 252 Atk EVs + Adamant is an option if your team needs some strong priority and a way to get past bulky special walls easier (think Goodra and Chansey)


    Usage Tips
    ========

        This set plays as a hit and run Pokemon, so make sure to bring it in whenever you can
        Use King's Shield with caution, as it can give free switches to dangerous Pokemon or result in Pokemon which you thought were harmless getting free boosts (eg. The Azumarill you thought was locked into Waterfall using Belly Drum)
        If you see hard counters to Aegislash (SpD Hippo, Mandibuzz), you are better off double switching after bringing Aegislash in


    Team Options
    ========

        Use Pokemon that can deal with bulky Ground-types with this set, such as Rotom-W (which actually beats every single good switch-in to Aegislash) and Greninja
        Mega Venusaur checks Rotom-W and most Ground-types


    The CRUMBLER
    ########
    name: The CRUMBLER
    move 1: Shadow Ball
    move 2: Sacred Sword
    move 3: Shadow Sneak
    move 4: King's Shield / Iron Head
    ability: Stance Change
    item: Life Orb / Spooky Plate
    nature: Quiet
    evs: 240 Atk / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 12 Spe

    Moves
    ========

        Shadow Ball simply wrecks crumbles. To give you a hint about its power, it has a 50% chance to OHKO max HP Deoxys-D
        Sacred Sword takes care of Dark- and Steel-types, namely Excadrill, Heatran, Bisharp, Chansey, and Greninja
        Shadow Sneak gets a lot 2HKOes when combined with the appripriate attacking move and makes for a decent revenge killing tool
        King's Shield lets Aegislash stay in after KOing something, giving it more staying power, and also check physical attackers with contact moves
        Iron Head covers Fairy-types and makes Aegislash a good check to any Clefable set
        Pursuit can be used on the last slot to trap and kill Pokemon such as Lati@s, Deoxys-S, and Starmie, all of which Aegislash can check reasonably well
        HP Ice to OHKO Gliscor, Lando-T, and Garchomp
        Head Smash can be used on the last slot to deal with Mandibuzz


    Set Details
    ========

        One of the best wallbreakers in OU
        Good lead too, against Deo-S, Deo-D, Terrakion and many others
        Honestly, good luck bringing something safely into this
        Both attacking stats are maxed to have as much power as possible, and Quiet because Shadow Ball is your primary move
        4 SpD EVs for Genesect
        Spooky Plate can be used if you don't like the recoil, however a lot of OHKO/2HKOes will be missed, such as the OHKO on Deo-D, 2HKO on SpD Hippo, 2HKO on max HP Heatran (Sacred Sword + SR) and 2HKO on Garchomp after SR (Shadow Ball + Shadow Sneak).


    Usage Tips
    ========

        As already mentioned, it's often wise to lead with Aegislash, as it gets good match ups against a lot of common leads and can start breaking things from turn 1
        No need to be overly concerned about hitting stuff with your coverage moves. Most of the time, Shadow Ball maims most of your checks anyway (Heatran, Landorus-T, Greninja, etc).
        This set applies a lot of pressure to any kind of team, which will usually lead to your opponent playing it safe and try to pivot through multiple Pokemon in hope to wear down Aegislash and minimize the damage done. This means that you can afford to play more risky and stay in in situatons where it would be suicidal to do so (eg against a Heatran that switched into Shadow Ball)
        In general, this set shines in opening holes to the opponent's team in early/mid-game, so make sure to bring Aegislash in as often as possbile during those stages


    Team Options
    ========

        Pivots that can bring Aegislash in safely. The best of those is Rotom-W, which attracts Pokemon that Aegslash fares well against (Trevenant, Latios, Latias, Blissey, Chansey, Ferrothorn) and brings him in safely with Volt Switch, while also having perfect defensive synergy with Aegislash
        Pokemon that can take advantage of the holes that Aegislash creates. SD Talonflame appreciates having Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Heatran weakened or KOed, and the same goes for DD Mega Char X
        SR helps Aegislash get KOes and apply pressure. Terrakion and Landorus-T are great offensive SR setters that can also handle some of the Pokemon that trouble Aegislash, such as Heatran, Excadrill, and Garchomp


    Offensive Swords Dance
    ########
    name: Offensive Swords Dance
    move 1: Swords Dance
    move 2: Shadow Sneak
    move 3: Iron Head
    move 4: Sacred Sword / Head Smash
    ability: Stance Change
    item: Life Orb
    nature: Adamant
    evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

    Moves
    ========

        SD makes Aegislash a great wallbreaker and sweeper
        Shadow Sneak OHKOes many faster Pokemon with the help of hazards, such as Excadrill, Thundurus, Keldeo, and Genesect
        Iron Head is your strongest move and deals with Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, Clefable, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Mega Venusaur. It is also extremely important for physically defensive Unaware Clefable, which would otherwise be able to take a hit and OHKO back Aegislash (after Head Smash recoil), or just wall it and set up on it (with Shadow Claw)
        Sacred Sword 2HKOes after a boost, Skarmory and OHKOes Ferrothorn, while also OHKOing faster Pokemon on the switch, such as offensive Heatran, Bisharp, and Greninja
        Head Smash OHKOes Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Landorus-T after and SD, which no other move can do, while still taking care of offensive Heatran and Greninja on the switch
        Shadow Claw is and ok move if you want to OHKO max HP / max Def+ Rotom-W after and SD and is also your strongest option vs Gyarados, Mega Scizor (without recoil), and Tentacruel. It is best used with Spooky Plate

    Set Details
    ========

        Max Speed allows Aegislash to outspeed Mega Venusaur, Mandibuzz, defensive Rotom-W, defensive Excarill, Landorus-T, Skarmory, and Heatran
        Spooky Plate if you go with Shadow Claw
        4 SpD for Genesect


    Usage Tips
    ========

        If you go with Sacred Sword on the last slot, use Aegislash as a wallbreaker early-game, to weaken down physical walls so that another physical sweeper can clean later. This set can fit on any team in need of a strong wallbreaker
        With Head Smash, Aegislash is perfect for HO hazard teams, as with a single SD Aegislash beats every single Defog and Rapid Spin user before they manage to get rid of hazards, while OHKOing some common Defog and Rapid Spin users even without an SD (Lati@s, Starmie, Excadrill, and Mandibuzz)
        Don't be afraid to play reckless with it, as long as you manage to weaken or break through the opponent's defensive core.


    Team Options
    ========

        Hazards. SR is a must, but Spikes always help, as you will be forcing a lot of switches. If you go with Head Smash, Deo-D is the best partner that Aegislash could have. Otherwise, any SR setter that has good synergy with Aegislash works
        Physical sweepers to take advantage of the holes that Aegislash punches. Mega Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, SD Lucario, etc.
        Checks to Garchomp, offensive Heatran, Greninja, and Bisharp, as if they get in as you use SD, they can take a +2 Shadow Sneak and OHKO back. Keldeo is an ok check to almost all of them, especially with Choice Scarf, AV Conk can check decently all of them aside from Garchomp, and Mega Gyarados checks all of them as well, while also being able to clean after Aegislash does some work


    Swords Dance + King's Shield
    ########
    name: Swords Dance + King's Shield
    move 1: Swords Dance
    move 2: King's Shield
    move 3: Shadow Sneak
    move 4: Sacred Sword
    ability: Stance Change
    item: Leftovers
    nature: Adamant
    evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD

    Moves
    ========

        Swords Dance makes Aegislash a significant threat
        SD + King's Shield is a great combo that lets Aegislash KO a Pokemon and then stay in and protect against the next one, while potentially weakening the foe in the process (if it tries to hit Aegislash with a contact move). King's Shield also works great with Leftovers
        Shadow Sneak picks off faster frail foes
        Sacred Sword provides perfect neutral coverage with Aegislash's Ghost STABs and does a lot of damage to many of Aegislash's checks on the switch, such as Heatran and Excadrill


    Set Details
    ========

        Max bulk to make up for Aegislash's low Speed, ensuring it can take a hit and then hit back
        4 SpD EVs for Genesect
        Should i use some Spe EVs? Enough Spe EVs to outrun 0 Spe Heatran maybe, or will this cut Aegislash's bulk too much? Anyway, the reasoning for the spread is the same with the first set
        Iron Head is an option if Fairies are too big of a threat, but Heatran and Excadrill are too common, so Sacred Sword is usually the best option


    Usage Tips
    ========

        Though it's common sense, don't set up when physical walls are alive if you can't hurt them. It's better to just double switch as those physical walls come in
        Use Shadow Sneak only if you are certain that the opponent will be OHKOed or if you have no other alternative, as otherwise it's almost certain you will be OHKOed back with Blade Forme's miserable bulk
        Don't get too greedy with getting SD boosts; set up only as much as it's necessary.


    Team Options
    ========

        Good and sturdy switch-ins to Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Mega Venusaur are good for this job. Skarmory can also get rid of the hazards that those Pokemon can set up with Defog and can set up its own hazards to assist Aegislash
        Strong physical attackers to soften up physical walls. DD Mega Char X, SD Talonflame, and SD Garchomp are good choices


    Autotomize
    ########
    name: Autotomize
    move 1: Autotomize
    move 2: Shadow Ball
    move 3: Hidden Power Ice
    move 4: Sacred Sword / Iron Head / Flash Cannon
    ability: Stance Change
    item: Life Orb / Weakness Policy
    nature: Rash
    evs: 88 Atk / 252 SpA / 168 Spe

    Moves
    ========

        Autotomize makes Aegislash a great late-game sweeper
        Shadow Ball hits hard
        HP Ice OHKOes many checks to Aegislash, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp
        Sacred Sword deals with Tyranitar, Blissey, Excadrll, Heatran, Greninja, and Bisharp
        Iron Head and Flash Cannon deal with Fairy-types. Iron Head hits most stuff than Flash Cannon but Flash Cannon has the benefit of OHKOing physically defensive Clefable and physically defensive Togekiss after SR.


    Set Details
    ========

        The EV spread allows Aegislash to outspeed positive base 130s at +2, SpA is maxed, and rest go to Atk in order to power up Aegislash's last move. Put the 88 EVs into HP if you are using Flash Cannon
        Life Orb is the most consistent item but Weakness Policy makes cleaning much easier if it does activate, which is not that hard.


    Usage Tips
    ========

        Only set up when you know that you can sweep or at least cause serious trouble. For this reason, you should usually save Aegislash 'till late-game, when its chances of sweeping are better.
        If you are using Weakness Policy, make sure that the opponent's best way of dealing with Aegislash is attacking and not statusing it, by eliminating the checks of Aegislash that prefer to status it, such as Rotom-W
        Identify if there are Pokemon that Aegislash can't outspeed even after one boost and eliminate them. If this is not an option, you are better off playing Aegislash as an all out attacker as you won't manage to sweep anyway


    Team Options
    ========

        Hazards
        Get rid of Scarfers (Goth or Wobb support)
        This set can lure and eliminate bulky Ground-types, so Pokemon that can take advantage of this work great with Aegislash


    Specially Defensive
    ########
    name: Specially Defensive
    move 1: King's Shield
    move 2: Shadow Ball
    move 3: Toxic
    move 4: Pursuit
    ability: Stance Change
    item: Leftovers
    nature: Sassy
    evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD

    Moves
    ========

        King's Shield helps Toxic stall, cripple physical attackers, and revert to Shield Forme after attacking
        Shadow Ball is your main source of damage, while also dealing good enough damage to most Steel-types, making sure that they can't switch in for free to block Toxic
        Toxic cripples many of Aegislash's common switch-ins, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Mandibuzz, Hippowdon, and Zapdos, and is especially useful for luring and crippling the Defog users
        Pursuit wears down Pokemon that SpD Aegislash counters easily, such as Deo-S, Lati@s, Alakazam, Espeon, Mega Gardevoir, and Starmie


    Set Details
    ========

        Max special bulk because Aegislash's typing is more suited to special walling
        Sub can fit on the last slot for better Toxic stalling and to protect against status from the likes of Rotom-W, Breloom, Jellicent, and Mega Venusaur, which can go through King's Shield


    Usage Tips
    ========

        This set is great on defensive teams. It checks many Pokemon, and deals with most Defog users, either by directly trapping them (Lati@s), or by crippling them on the switch with Toxic (Mandibuzz and Zapdos), which greatly helps in getting rid of them, so you can quickly set up your hazards unhindered.
        Keep the surprise of Toxic until the Defog user comes in, otherwise they won't switch into you


    Team Options
    ========

        Wish support. All the good Wish passer have great synergy with Aegislash, so pick whichever you like more
        Hazards, including Spikes, to take advantage of Aegi's ability to get rid of Defog users, as well as spinblock offensive Starmie
        Pokemon to cover it's weaknesses
