[LONG DESC]
<p>Increases the accuracy of all moves used by this Pokémon by 30%. This is a multiplicative increase, not additive, meaning if a move has 50% accuracy before Compoundeyes, it is brought to 65% (.5 * 1.3) total accuracy afterward. When a Pokémon with this ability is first in the party, wild Pokémon will have a higher chance of holding an item.</p>
