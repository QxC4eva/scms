
Overview
########

With a base 125 Attack stat and access to Dragon Dance Gyarados is a Pokemon that boasts being an offensive powerhouse. Thanks to its typing which gives it resistances to numerous common attacks such as Close Combat and U-turn and two excellent abilities in Intimidate and Moxie Gyarados can easily set up and tear massive holes in teams. That's not all, though - Gyarados's great defensive typing and access to Intimidate allows Gyarados to easily set up Dragon Dance or become a wall. Roar and Dragon Tail compliment Gyarados's typing and bulky defensive stats to pull a defensive moveset with Rest and Sleep Talk. The sheer versatility Gyarados offers is not to be underestimated when building teams around Gyarados. Bear in mind Gyarados's middling Speed, even after a Dragon Dance, can leave it prone to revenge killers such as Scarf Genesect, Scarf Terrakion, and Deoxys-S. The weakness to Stealth Rock can also be crippling as it hampers Gyarados's longevity.

Thanks to Generation VI Gyarados was blessed with access to a Mega Evolution. Mega Gyarados swaps out its Flying-typing for Dark-type - allowing Mega Gyarados to set up on Pokemon that rely on using Stone Edge to take out Gyarados. Furthermore, Mega Gyarados's defensive stats significantly increase as well as its Attack. Mold Breaker, its new ability, allows Mega Gyarados to punish Pokemon that rely on Levitate to dodge Earthquake, Storm Drain to block its monstrous STAB Waterfall, and piercing Unaware so that Clefable has a difficult time stopping it. Though Mega Gyarados obtains many notable weaknesses such as Mach Punch and U-turn Mega Gyarados also loses its nasty quadruple weakness to Electric-type attacks. Gyarados is a very flexible Pokemon both offensively and defensively and Mega Gyarados simply adds to the flexibility that Gyarados can provide to its team.


Mega Dragon Dance
########
name: Mega Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Bite / Stone Edge / Substitute
ability: Intimidate
item: Gyaradosite
nature: Adamant
evs: 32 HP / 252 Atk / 224 Spe

Moves
========

This set's goal is to set up Dragon Dance in order to let Gyarados sweep opposing teams. STAB Waterfall is Gyarados's main STAB as it provides steady power, perfect accuracy, and a 20% flinch rate. Earthquake compliments Waterfall as it too has perfect accuracy, great power, and hits many targets that otherwise resist STAB Waterfall while also bypassing Aegislash's King's Shield. Thanks to Mega Gyarados having access to Mold Breaker Earthquake can target multiple Levitate users such as Rotom-W and Gengar. Bite hits the majority of Gyarados's checks in counters - in particular Jellicent, Celebi, Trevenant, Gourgeist, and Slowbro as a few examples. Stone Edge is great for opposing Gyarados, Kyurem-B, Zapdos, and Dragonite. Substitute may seem like an odd option on a set that doesn't utilize Leftovers as an item; however, Substitute is great for helping Gyarados set up on targets such as Scizor and Gastrodon while making Gyarados difficult to becoming prone to being revenge killed by Scarf Genesect and Deoxys-S. Substitute can prevent Intimidate from lowering Gyarados's Attack as well as preventing moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed from crippling Gyarados. Ice Fang, after a Dragon Dance, can 2HKO Calm Mega Venusaur while still harming Celebi, Garchomp, and Dragonite.

Bounce is also a viable alternative to use on this set. The purpose of Bounce is to bypass Mega Venusaur and Celebi as Gyarados to help Mega Gyarados sweep later in the game. After Stealth Rock +1 Bounce is capable of OHKOing Mega Venusaur 50% of the time and will also OHKO Bold Celebi.

Set Details
========

224 Spe EVs allow Gyarados to outspeed Timid Noivern while placing the remaining EVs into HP for a little extra bulk. Max Speed with 4 EVs in Defense can also be used if you're afraid of opposing Gyarados. Intimidate is the recommended ability with this set as Gyarados and Mega Gyarados appreciate the Attack drop provided by Intimidate to maximize Gyarados's bulk while using Dragon Dance. Moxie, though not necessarily the best ability, is great for punishing opponents that use sacs to safely switch into their Gyarados check. Since Gyarados doesn't immediately become Mega Gyarados Moxie can be utilized to give Mega Gyarados extra power while limiting the number of Dragon Dances necessary to set up.

Usage Tips
========

Gyarados is a very flexible Mega Evolution case. Staying as regular Gyarados to utilize Intimidate and Flying-types great resistances and immunity to Earthquake can help benefit setting up Mega Gyarados. Since Mega Gyarados will usually draw in attacks such as Keldeo's Secret Sword and Genesect's U-turn, Gyarados can stall out its Mega Evolution to set up on Pokemon that might be targetting to take out Mega Gyarados but not normal Gyarados. Even so, Gyarados can also use its Flying-type to bait for a free Dragon Dance as Mega Gyarados. For example, Gyarados can switch into Landorus-T and Mega Evolve to take laughable damage from Stone Edge. Another great example is stalling out Gyarados's Mega Evolution to bait Rotom-W in then immediately Mega Evolving and shutting it down with Mold Breaker Earthquake. Mega Gyarados has awesome bulk and can take emergency attacks at full health. Gyarados can fool Scarf Genesect into using Thunderbolt as, when Gyarados Mega Evolves, proceeds to take 53% damage tops from Thunderbolt and OHKO Genesect back with +1 Waterfall. When utilizing Moxie Gyarados should be held back and used later in the game or when the opponent has a potentially significant amount of Pokemon to sac. Moxie should be stacked up as much as Gyarados possibly can before Mega Evolving as it will lose Moxie for Mold Breaker. The coverage move of choice is crucial to what Gyarados will need eliminated before it can attempt to sweep. Remember that Mega Gyarados's number one counter is Ferrothorn. Unless Gyarados is utilizing Bounce Mega Ferrothorn either being weakened or cleared out is an absolute must before Gyarados can attempt to sweep.

Team Options
========

Mega Gyarados is a Pokemon that has a very strong presence but, as always, appreciates back-up from other Pokemon. Mega Gyarados is an excellent late game cleaner so packing heavy offenses from Pokemon such as Kyurem-B. Kyurem-B can plow through many of Gyarados's checks and counters easily with Fusion Bolt and STAB Ice Beam. Latios also can puncture problematic Water-types and does well against Mega Venusaur thanks to STAB Psyshock and can utilize Defog offensively. With Hidden Power Fire Skarmory and Ferrothorn become less of an issue. Talonflame is an excellent offensive teammate with access to Gale Wings Brave Bird taking out Conkeldurr and Breloom while using STAB Flare Blitz to roast Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Ferrothorn has multiple methods of supporting Gyarados through entry hazards, paralysis, and Leech Seed to help Gyarados recover health while setting up Dragon Dance. For removing entry hazards consider Starmie for Rapid Spin and ways of tackling bulky Water-types and Mega Venusaur. For Defog users Latias, Scizor, and Zapdos all work well. Latias and Zapdos do well at tackling bulky Water-types. Latias can handle Mega Venusaur while Scizor can utilize STAB U-turn to help Gyarados switch-in.


Bulky Dragon Dance
########
name: Bulky Dragon Dance
move 1: Substitute / Taunt
move 2: Dragon Dance
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Bounce / Earthquake
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers
evs: 120 HP / 64 Atk / 100 Def / 224 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

This set takes a different approach from Gyarados's full offensive sets. Gyarados utilizes its great typing, natural bulk, and Intimidate to set up multiple Dragon Dances and then attempt to sweep. Taunt and Substitute are the two moves of choice to help Gyarados set up Dragon Dances or sweep easier. Taunt does an excellent job of shutting down recovery, stopping moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Toxic from hampering Gyarados's sweep, and preventing Roar and Whirlwind from forcing Gyarados out. Taunt is great for threats such as Skarmory, Gliscor, Trevenant, and Gourgeist as the majority of their moveset is dependant on support moves such as Substitute, Roost, Whirlwind, and Will-O-Wisp. Substitute functions by preventing status from hampering Gyarados, blocking weak attacks to ease setting up Dragon Dance and obtain extra recovery from Leftovers, and prevent Gyarados from being easy to revenge kill. Bounce is Gyarados's best option for its attack. Bounce allows Gyarados to bypass its biggest counters - Mega Venusaur and Celebi - while using Bounce to obtain extra health from Leftovers and protect Gyarados's Substitute. Taunt and Bounce are great because Taunt completely shuts down the option of blocking Bounce through Substitute or Protect. Though Bounce is superior in most scenarios on this set Earthquake can be used to guarantee OHKOing -1 Mega Lucario while bypassing any King's Shield mind game from Aegislash. Stone Edge is an option to beat opposing Gyarados, Kyurem-B, and Rotom-W easier.

Set Details
========

The given EVs allow +1 Gyarados to outspeed Timid Noivern. Furthermore, the HP and Def EVs allow Gyarados to withstand a U-turn from Choice Scarf Genesect and burned Ferrothorn's Power Whip while behind a Substitute. It also prevents many Water-types such as Scarf Keldeo locked onto Surf, Gastrodon, and Slowbro missing Psyshock from breaking through Gyarados's Substitute. Best of all Gyarados is guaranteed to take +1 Close Combat from Jolly Mega Lucario and heavily dent it with STAB Waterfall or OHKO it with Earthquake. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to help Gyarados's attack still hit reasonably hard after a single Dragon Dance. With Stealth Rock +1 Bounce can OHKO Calm Mega Venusaur, offensive Celebi, and max HP Conkeldurr. Gyarados can opt to go slower in exchange for extra power. After a Dragon Dance 176 Speed EVs guarantees outspeeding positive Speed natured Starmie.

Usage Tips
========

Bulky Dragon Dance Gyarados is a very flexible Pokemon due to its offensive and defensive prowess. The choice of Substitute and Taunt is very crucial to knowing how to succeed with Gyarados setting up Dragon Dance. Taunt means running a few more risks with Dragon Tail, Scald, and Lava Plume; however, Substitute is still vulnerable to Roar, Whirlwind, and Bounce being blocked by Protect, Substitute, and King's Shield. Gyarados can switch into a variety of offensive and defensive Pokemon and begin setting up. With Taunt Gyarados can switch into opposing Skarmory and Taunt to prevent Skarmory from using Whirlwind and Roost. Thanks to Intimidate and Gyarados's defensive EV spread Brave Bird is a possible 5HKO while Skarmory will continue to take recoil and make a 2HKO from boosted Waterfall easier. Substitute is great against Pokemon such as Gastrodon which relies on status to cripple its opponents and continuously set up Dragon Dance. Best of all Substitute can make it difficult to revenge kill Gyarados. If you desperately need this Gyarados to check Mega Lucario and Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X while doing maximum damage to them opt for Earthquake over Bounce and seek out Pokemon that can take out Mega Venusaur and Celebi.

Team Options
========

This variation of Gyarados works exceptionally well on balanced teams that combine offensive and defensive Pokemon. Mega Venusaur is a great defensive Grass-types that can harass a lot of Gyarados's checks and counters with its great defenses and solid movepool. It can use STAB Sludge Bomb for Unaware Clefable while STAB Giga Drain eliminates Rotom-W. Hidden Power Fire helps ease the the burden on Gyarados bypassing Ferrothorn as well as being used as an emergency check to Swords Dance Mega Lucario. Ferrothorn resists many of Gyarados's weaknesses while being able utilize its kit to aid Gyarados remain bulky with Leech Seed, ensure KOes with Stealth Rock, or slow opponents down with Thunder Wave. Bulky Water-types with Scald or Will-O-Wisp are great for luring Ferrothorn to help Gyarados set up on Ferrothorn that rely on Power Whip. Rotom-W and Jellicent are great examples that can immediately burn Ferrothorn with Will-O-Wisp. Trevenant and Gourgeist are great examples of Pokemon that can use Will-O-Wisp and / or Leech Seed to aid Gyarados. Starmie can spin away Stealth Rock while handling Skarmory and Mega Venusaur with Thunderbolt and STAB Psyshock, respectively. Scald also can be used on Starmie to be used as a lure to Ferrothorn. Latias, Scizor, and Zapdos are great users of Defog. Scizor and Zapdos can use STAB U-turn and STAB Volt Switch, respectively, to pivot to Gyarados to help it set up. Latios is an offensive alternative to Latias to use Defog as it can leave dents and KO various Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Latias can utilize its supportive movepool such as Reflect, Light Screen, Wish, and Healing Wish to aid Gyarados and use STAB Psyshock to prevent Mega Venusaur from bullying Gyarados. Thanks to Magnet Pull Magnezone is great way of completely removing threats such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn altogether.


Offensive Dragon Dance
########
name: Offensive Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Bounce / Stone Edge
ability: Moxie
item: Life Orb / Lum Berry
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

Moves
========

This Gyarados trades any attempt at bulking Gyarados out to become purely offensive. Waterfall is your primary STAB while Earthquake tackles grounded Electric-types and does great damage on threats such as Jirachi and Aegislash. Bounce is the best option for Gyarados's final move to help bypass Celebi, Mega Venusaur, and dent bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Gastrodon. Stone Edge can be used to eliminate Zapdos, Dragonite, and Mandibuzz. Aqua Tail is a stronger yet slightly more inaccurate alternative to Waterfall. With Life Orb and Stealth Rock +1 Aqua Tail can OHKO Mega Mawile, max HP Scizor, and Mega Charizard X.


Set Details
========

Adamant with max Attack and Speed is recommended for this set to help maximize Gyarados's tyranny. The ability choice is tricky because they both are very good for this set. Life Orb is great for maximizing Gyarados's power and 2HKOing Skarmory with +1 Waterfall. Lum Berry is an alternative item to protect Gyarados from harmful status such as burns and paralysis. Wacan Berry is a good item option to assist Gyarados setting up Dragon Dance too. For example Scarf Genesect's Thunderbolt will fail to OHKO Gyarados even after Stealth Rock. This is a great way to set up a second Dragon Dance if Genesect is coming in on the revenge kill. Intimidate is a viable ability to help Gyarados set up Dragon Dance; however, Moxie is very good with this set as Gyarados wants to set up as minimal amount of Dragon Dances as possible.

Usage Tips
========

When using this set it is best to use this Gyarados as either a late game sweeper or a Pokemon that can create dents in the opponent's team mid game. Thus you want your opponent to save Pokemon as potential sacs for Gyarados to give Gyarados with Moxie extra boosts in Attack. Though it may seem questionable to use Gyarados as a Pokemon that dents holes instead of sweeping through the opponent's teams, other Pokemon such as Mega Lucario can take advantage of weakened threats and sweep through the rest of the entire team. This is partly because this set should not attempt to set up multiple Dragon Dances. Instead, this set wants to take advantage of either one or two boosts and then utilize Moxie for the remaining Attack power that Gyarados might need. Life Orb is highly recommended due to the sheer power that Gyarados can have even after a single Dragon Dance. If you are utilizing Lum Berry or Wacan Berry as alternative items these items can be used to help Gyarados obtain a second Dragon Dance or to safely 2HKO potential threats that rely on status or Electric-type attacks to stop Gyarados.


Team Options
========

This variation of Gyarados appreciates powerful Pokemon that can puncture through teams and weaken them significantly to help Gyarados finish them off. Kyurem-B is a great example as it can handle Rotom-W with Substitute + Earth Power, Skarmory and bulky Water-types with Fusion Bolt, and can at least threaten Mega Venusaur and weaken physically defensive Ferrothorn with STAB Ice Beam. Since this Gyarados doesn't use Gyaradosite Mega Evolutions can help with beating holes through the opponents team. Nasty Plot Mega Lucario can place major press onto Skarmory and Ferrothorn with STAB Aura Sphere. Mega Charizard X can utilize its STAB Flare Blitz to burst through Skarmory and Ferrothorn while heavily damaging bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W with STAB Dragon Claw. Entry hazard removal is very vital. Starmie can spin away hazards and wear out bulky Water-types, Skarmory, and Mega Venusaur. while Latias, Scizor, and Zapdos are great Defog teammates that can assist Gyarados. Latias can Defog for Gyarados while using STAB Psyshock to harass Mega Venusaur. Zapdos can use STAB Thunderbolt or STAB Volt Switch to tackle bulky Water-types. Scizor can utilize STAB U-turn to help Gyarados pivot in easier. Latios is a great offensive teammate with Gyarados as it can also utilize Defog to clear out Stealth Rock while punishing Mega Venusaur with STAB Psyshock and Skarmory and Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire.


RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Waterfall
move 2: Roar / Dragon Tail
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Def
nature: Impish


Moves
========

This set's purpose is mainly to utilize Intimidate and Gyarados's great typing and bulk as a status absorber and a defensive Pokemon. With Rest and Sleep Talk Gyarados can remove status, keep itself healthy, and not be completely prone while staying asleep. Waterfall is mandatory STAB and helps Gyarados check potential threats such as Mega Lucario, Heatran, and Talonflame. Roar and Dragon Tail keeps Gyarados from becoming setup bait. Roar will bypass Substitute and Fairy-types. Dragon Tail will bypass Taunt as well as being Gyarados's best attack against Mega Charizard X. Earthquake is a viable alternative if you feel Gyarados needs to eliminate Mega Lucario immediately while 2HKOing max HP Mega Mawile after Stealth Rock.


Set Details
========

The given EVs and nature maximize Gyarados's bulk while using Intimidate to cripple physical threats such as Mega Lucario, Mega Charizard X, and Talonflame. Leftovers is necessary on this set to keep Gyarados healthy.

Usage Tips
========

This set takes advantage of Gyarados's bulk - not its offenses. This Gyarados is great to tackle offensive threats such as Mega Lucario and Talonflame. Gyarados is guaranteed to survive +2 Close Combat from Mega Lucario while dealing 62% minimum to -1 Mega Lucario. What's great about this Gyarados is that it can remain healthy most of the time and repeatedly switch in and out of the opponent while using Intimidate to weaken physical attackers. Removal of Stealth Rock is necessary to help Gyarados tank threats as much as possible.


Team Options
========

Stealth Rock is a great way of punishing Pokemon while shuffling with Roar or Dragon Tail. Ferrothorn is a cool teammate because it can lay Stealth Rock to help Gyarados when using Roar or Dragon Tail, paralysis to completely cripple offensive threats, and Leech Seed to help Gyarados passively recover on some targets. Rapid Spin from Starmie works well by eliminating potential offensive threats and some defensive targets. Since Dragon Tail can be a liability against Fairy-types Excadrill can be used to execute them with STAB Iron Head while spinning away entry hazards. Mega Venusaur is also a great teammate because it can rely on Gyarados's Intimidate to help tank otherwise dangerous threats such as other Gyarados, Rotom-W, and Azumarill. Using another Pokemon with Intimidate such as Landorus-T and Krookodile can be great to scare off physically offensive threats or make them hit significantly weaker than normal.


Other Options
########

Choice Band and Choice Scarf sets can be used on Gyarados with Moxie as the ability. While having immediate power or Speed and using Moxie to help boost Gyarados's Attack may seem appealing, it is restricted to one attack and STAB Waterfall isn't powerful enough without Rain to use as a standalone attack most of the time. A bulkier set with Thunder Wave or Toxic, Taunt, Waterfall, and Roar or Dragon Tail can be used with Wish and cleric support. Thunder Wave can cripple some of Gyarados's offensive threats while Toxic wears down defensive threats. Though it requires a Lonely or Naughty nature Fire Blast is Gyarados's fastest way of eliminating Ferrothorn and 2HKOing Skarmory.


Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Grass-types**: Without Bounce and Ice Fang Gyarados is prone to Grass-types hampering its sweep. Ferrothorn, Trevenant, Gourgeist, Mega Venusaur, and Celebi are the best examples as all of these have methods of crippling Gyarados or stopping Gyarados's sweep. Ferrothorn is arguably the best counter to Gyarados thanks to its awesome typing, STAB Power Whip, access to Stealth Rock, and capable of crippling Gyarados with Leech Seed or Thunder Wave. Ferrothorn's ability also is a major thorn to Gyarados since STAB Waterfall, STAB Bounce, STAB Bite, and Ice Fang are contact moves. With Substitute Gourgeist and Trevenant can stall out Bounce and can break Gyarados's Substitute with STAB Horn Leech or STAB Seed Bomb. Will-O-Wisp can cripple Gyarados as well. Mega Gyarados can use Bite to bypass these threats. Mega Venusaur and Celebi are more prone to Bounce and, in Celebi's case, Bite and Ice Fang. With STAB Giga Drain they can completely stop Gyarados's sweep while recovering health.

**Bulky Water-types**: Rotom-W is a great check to regular Gyarados thanks to access to STAB Volt Switch and Will-O-Wisp to cripple Gyarados. Vaporeon is a huge nuisance to Gyarados as it can use Wish + Protect to stall out Bounce and cripple Gyarados with status. Unaware Quagsire can threaten Gyarados thanks to Unaware ignoring all stat boosts. Jellicent can immediately burn Gyarados with Will-O-Wisp and prevent being 2HKOed by offensive Dragon Dance Gyarados. Mega Gyarados and Bulky Dragon Dance Gyarados can scare Jellicent, though.

**Physical Walls**: Physical walls such as Mandibuzz, Skarmory, and Mega Aggron can give Gyarados a lot of trouble. Mandibuzz can beat any Gyarados without Stone Edge while +1 Foul Play will OHKO any offensive Gyarados. Bulky sets can be phazed out with Whirlwind and, without Stealth Rock, Mega Gyarados will fail to 2HKO with STAB Waterfall. Skarmory is only 2HKOed by +1 Mega Gyarados Aqua Tail or +1 Life Orb Gyarados Waterfall. Taunt sets can screw up Skarmory as well; however, Skarmory is capable of setting up Stealth Rock to limit Gyarados's opportunities to switch-in, Spikes to hamper Mega Gyarados, Roost off damage taken, phase out with Whirlwind, or just attack Gyarados with STAB Brave Bird. Mega Aggron can shrug off boosted Earthquake from regular Gyarados thanks to Filter and set up Curse in front of Gyarados. Be wary of Mold Breaker Earthquake from Mega Gyarados - +1 Earthquake 2HKOes Mega Aggron. Mega Aggron can carry Stone Edge or phase it out with Roar or Dragon Tail. Umbreon can withstand +1 Waterfall from regular Gyarados and OHKO back with STAB Foul Play. It can use Roar to phase out Gyarados, cripple it with status or Taunt to prevent Gyarados from setting up. Clefable is great as it can use Unaware to block non-Mega Gyarados's boosts while 3HKOing most Gyarados with STAB Moonblast. Clefable can Encore Gyarados while it uses Dragon Dance or Substitute and cripple with status.

**Scarf-users**: Scarf Pokemon - Genesect in particular - can hamper Gyarados's sweep. It can use Thunderbolt to OHKO regular Gyarados while using STAB U-turn against Mega Gyarados. Garchomp and Landorus-T can threaten regular Gyarados with Stone Edge while both have access to STAB Earthquake against Mega Gyarados. Rotom-W can outspeed +1 Gyarados and shut it down with STAB Volt Switch. Terrakion and Keldeo both outspeed +1 Gyarados and can OHKO with Stone Edge and Hidden Power Electric, respectively.
