[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts a random stat, including accuracy and evasion, by two stages as long as the stat is not already at +6. Fails if no stat stage can be raised or if used on an ally with a Substitute. This move ignores Protect and Detect.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Acupressure is an intriguing move that could have many useful applications. Its biggest draw is undoubtedly its ability to increase the evasion stat of the user without breaking the Evasion Clause, which prevents the use of moves such as Minimize and Double Team in Smogon's standard competitive metagames. However, in most cases it is not worth the bother to try to stall for the evasion boost, as the chances of it occurring before the user is knocked out by the opponent's attacks, and then being of use afterwards, are at best minimal. Competitively speaking, more reliable boosting moves are favored; however, Acupressure is infamous for its integral role in several noteworthy strategies for pulling off win streaks in the Battle Subway, when coupled with a Trick or Flash userâ€”Drapion with Acupressure, Rest, Substitute, and Crunch is the most well-known of these.</p>
