Overview
########
- Amazing offensive stats and great Speed in Mega Evolved form
- Awesome ability in Magic Bounce, so it can deter hazard and status use; also makes it immune to Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp
- Swords Dance and STAB Sucker Punch make it a frightening sweeper, especially with the fact that Steel doesn't resist Dark anymore
- Awesome offensive movepool, so it can hit many threats with great coverage
- Immense frailty is the nail in the coffin though
- Sucker Punch is very shaky and has low PP, lackluster Speed before Mega Evolving makes it somewhat reliant on it
- Absol needs to Mega Evolve in order to be viable

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Sucker Punch
move 2: Pursuit / Knock Off
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Play Rough / Superpower
item: Absolite
ability: Justified
nature: Naive
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- This set makes use of Absol's great offensive movepool to smack around its opponents
- Sucker Punch is great STAB that hits very hard and has priority
- Pursuit is great to hit Pokemon wanting to flee from Absol
- Knock Off though provides a more reliable STAB move, and the item loss is big
- Fire Blast hits Aegislash, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, etc.
- Play Rough hits Fighting-types as well as Dragons
- Superpower if one wants to use Knock Off, hits Heatran and Tyranitar which is cool
- Iron Tail could be useful if you're scared of Fairies, but the accuracy is shaky

Set Details
========
- Naive nature is used to maximize Absol's Speed and allow it to utilize its great Special Attack in conjunction with that absurd Attack
- Absolite is necessary since Absol needs to mega evolve in order to be viable
- Justified is a viable ability to get an Attack boost off of a Dark-move on a rare occasion

Usage Tips
========
- This Absol is a good revenge killer and trapper, using its power and speed to hit hard
- It also wallbreaks well with Knock Off, and its coverage helps in this as well
- Use it to wallbreak and revenge kill, and avoid trying to switch Absol into anything because it's frail
- Mega Evolve quickly since Absol's Mega Evolution is viable but not without its Mega Evolution

Team Options
========
- Aegislash is fine since it can come in on Fighting-types, Talonflame can also smash Fighting-types as well
- Fighting-types themselves can benefit from Absol breaking down Alakazam and Gengar
- Fairies are viable as well, Sylveon, Azumarill, and Gardevoir are all perfectly viable to handle Fighting-types like Conkeldurr

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Night Slash / Knock Off
move 4: Play Rough / Baton Pass
item: Absolite
ability: Justified
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Swords Dance is also viable to make Absol a frightening sweeper, and its Sucker Punches are more fearsome than ever
- Sucker Punch is STAB that is priority, so Absol revenge kills
- Night Slash is a secondary STAB choice that is more reliable
- Knock Off is the more powerful choice that removes items but is illegal with Play Rough
- Play Rough hits Fighting-types such as Terrakion for great damage while
- Baton Pass is a very good move for Absol to escape from its counters and resort to a teammate, while allowing them to make use of its SD boost

Set Details
========
- Jolly to make use of Absol's Speed to sweep with
- Magic Bounce is an incredible ability which blocks status and the likes
- Justified has occasional use before Mega Evolving, so Absol can switch into a Dark Pulse or Knock Off to get an Attack boost

Usage Tips
========
- It's a sweeper, and Magic Bounce should be used to allow it to set up on defensive threats
- Absol's frailty will get in the way, but being able to use things like Chansey as setup fodder is useful
- Mega Evolve quickly, since Absol is mediocre without its Mega Form


Team Options
========
- Counters to Fighting-types are great, Aegislash is a very good teammate
- Talonflame is also usable to smack around opposing Fighting-types like Keldeo
- Special attackers can be useful to pester physical walls, namely Pokemon like Scarf Gardevoir can be useful

Other Options
########
- Ice Beam is usable to hit Dragons like Garchomp and friends
- Calm Mind is definitely not out of the question with a wide movepool and passable Special Attack
- Baton Pass
- Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are cool support moves but Absol's lack of bulk prevents it from making good use of the move
- Psycho Cut could be used to hit Fighting-types if Knock Off is to be used, but it's too weak

Checks & Counters
########
- Scarf Terrakion/Keldeo
- Sylveon
- Azumarill and Togekiss are in a similar boat
- Mega Venusaur
- Landorus-T
- Heatran (unless Absol runs Superpower)
- Gyarados
- Basically anything exceptionally bulky since Absol relies on somewhat weak moves
- Conkeldurr
- Pick on its weak defenses
- Gamble with Sucker Punch, likely with Substitute
- Typically quite difficult to counter due to Sucker Punch
