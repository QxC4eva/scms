[Overview]

<p>Granbull: a typical, slow hard-hitter that is somewhat bulky. Granbull boasts a great Attack, good HP, and decent Defense; unfortunately, its Special Defense is rather middling. This makes Granbull seem like a Pokemon that's all about bulky offense, but that's not the case. Granbull is horribly outclassed by Ursaring, which is a better user of Quick Feet thanks to its higher Speed, not to mention Ursaring's access to Guts makes it hit harder. When using Granbull, however, one should take advantage of the amazing support movepool it has, as well as the great physical bulk it gets due to Intimidate. With access to moves such as Thunder Wave and Heal Bell, Granbull stands out amongst the competition.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The ability to run a support set is what sets Granbull apart from Ursaring. Thunder Wave and Toxic provide the team with status support, and the choice between them depends on what your team needs. If your team is in need of a Pokemon to slow down the opposition, Thunder Wave is the preferred option, whereas Toxic should be used if Granbull's teammates have trouble against certain bulky Pokemon, or if the team lacks a user of either Toxic or Toxic Spikes. Heal Bell is a great move, and allows Granbull to provide cleric support. Super Fang allows Granbull to deal reasonable damage to Steel-types, such as Steelix and Ferroseed, and Crunch hits Ghost-types super effectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Return and Body Slam are reliable STAB options. Body Slam also has the nice ability to paralyze the foe, so it works great with Toxic. Reflect can be used to increase Granbull's already high Defense, and further supports the team. Roar is good move for phazing the opponent, and works great with entry hazards. Taunt is also a good option to use, and works well in combination with Super Fang and Toxic to break down stall. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD can be used, but is not recommended, as Granbull's middling Special Defense makes it hard for it to take special attacks, even with maximum investment.</p>

<p>Teammates that can take advantage of the support Granbull provides are a given. Pokemon such as Absol, Gorebyss, and Omastar benefit from Thunder Wave support, allowing them to either set up more easily or just outspeed and KO the opponent. Gorebyss and Omastar also benefit from Toxic support, as it makes it easier for them to take down Slowking and Lanturn, Pokemon that can survive an assault from them. Rest users benefit from Heal Bell support; Poliwrath is a great example of this, as it has no other recovery move. Ghost-types in general have good synergy with Granbull, as they can take Fighting-type moves directed at it. Dusknoir and Spiritomb stand out as they can take special moves with ease as well.</p>

[SET]
name: Tank
move 1: Thunder Wave
move 2: Double-Edge / Return
move 3: Close Combat
move 4: Crunch
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
ability: Intimidate
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thunder Wave can not only be used to support Granbull's team, but for Granbull itself. Double-Edge is Granbull's most powerful STAB, and will hit everything that doesn't resist it hard. Return is a slightly safer, but weaker option; it is worthwhile if you don't like the idea of taking recoil damage, however. Close Combat lets Granbull hit Steel-types that resist Double-Edge and Return, and Crunch lets it hit Ghost-types who are immune to Granbull's STAB moves. The choice of item depends solely on what you prefer. Leftovers keeps Granbull alive longer, and works especially well with Double-Edge, whereas Life Orb gives Granbull much needed power if you opt to use Return.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Ice Punch and Stone Edge are both viable options. Ice Punch hits and the rare Torterra and Altaria hard, whereas Stone Edge does massive damage to Pokemon such as Moltres and Scyther. An alternate EV spread consisting of 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe EVs can be used to let Granbull outspeed minimum base 60 Speed Pokemon, which includes Clefable. Even though Granbull provides support with Thunder Wave itself, it does benefit from any help it can get. Screen support can help Granbull survive certain attacks, especially physical ones, thanks to Intimidate. Uxie can set up both Reflect and Light Screen while also being able to set up Stealth Rock. Spikes and Toxic Spikes are also useful, as they can help secure some KOs against bulkier opponents. Roselia and Scolipede are the best choices who come to mind, as they resist Fighting-type moves. Scolipede even has a 4x resistance to these moves.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Double-Edge / Return

evs: 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the best offensive approach Granbull can take, and with Choice Band and Intimidate, Granbull becomes a bulky hard-hitter. Double-Edge will hit everything that doesn't resist it hard, easily breaking through the opposition. Return is an option to avoid the recoil damage caused by Double-Edge, but it's a much weaker option. Close Combat hits the Rock- and Steel-types who resist Granbull's STAB moves. Crunch covers the Ghost-types who would otherwise wall this set. Ice Punch is another vital move for Granbull as a safety option, garnering it fantastic neutral coverage on many Pokemon that may switch into it for neutral or super effective damage, such as Tangrowth and Spiritomb. Ice Punch also hits the rare Altaria and Torterra harder. This set is a good wallbreaker, and helps clear up a path for the rest of the team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs lets Granbull outspeed minimum Speed Clefable, as well as other Pokemon under base 60 Speed. The remaining EVs are used to maximize Granbull's power output, and the leftovers are put into HP for more bulk. Rapid Spin support is appreciated, as like any other Choice item user, Granbull is going to switch a lot. Sandslash partners best with Granbull, as it can take most Fighting-type moves directed at Granbull while also resisting Stealth Rock. Ghost-types, such Dusknoir and Rotom, can help take Fighting-type moves for Granbull as well, and have good synergy with it.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A set revolving around Quick Feet is still usable, but as stated before, it's heavily outclassed by Ursaring. Thanks to Granbull's miniscule Speed stat, it is a great candidate for a Trick Room sweeper. Granbull also has access to Bulk Up, boosting its Attack and Defense, but with Granbull's middling Special Defense, it's often a bad choice. Like most other Normal-types, Granbull has a great special movepool, including moves such as Thunderbolt, Flamethrower, Focus Blast, and Shadow Ball. However, Granbull's Special Attack is as bad as its Special Defense, and the only way to boost it is through Work Up; it does give Granbull the opportunity to go mixed, hitting Ferroseed, Tangrowth, and Steelix hard with Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Different Pokemon counter Granbull depending on what set it runs. Bulky Ghost-types, such as Dusknoir and Spiritomb, have no trouble taking on any set if they carry Will-O-Wisp. Weezing can burn Granbull with Will-O-Wisp as well, and can take hits with its physical prowess. Tangrowth has no problem taking a hit, and can put Granbull to sleep with Sleep Powder. Other physically defensive Pokemon, such as Ferroseed, Steelix, and Magneton, can take Granbull on as long it doesn't repeatedly use super effective moves; all three need to be wary of Close Combat. Duosion has no trouble setting up on the support set, easily recovering the damage dealt by Granbull with Recover. Duosion can then proceed to easily KO it with a powerful Psychic or Hidden Power Fighting. Though Granbull might be hard to switch in on (the Choice Band version especially), any hard-hitting attacker will KO Granbull. Galvantula, Rotom-C, and Moltres are all examples of special attackers that can easily KO Granbull, aiming at its low Special Defense stat. Even physically offensive Pokemon with Fighting-type moves can break through Granbull if they have enough firepower. Medicham is one example, blowing Granbull up with STAB High Jump Kick.</p>
