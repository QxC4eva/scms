[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Meditate is outclassed by Swords Dance, and should only be used when the latter is unavailable. However, even then most players opt for the power of a Choice Band instead of Meditate, due to the fact that use of a Choice Band means that the player doesn't have to waste a time setting up and can attack right off the bat. What's more, Meditate takes up a moveslot, which could be used instead for another coverage move.</p>
