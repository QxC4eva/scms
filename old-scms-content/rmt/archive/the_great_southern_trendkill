<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello Smogon, my name is Funkasaurus, presenting a joint RMT of a team I made with my tutor, BKC. I've had a good amount of success with this team, peaking 7th on the ladder with 1561 points. I also used this team to reach semi-finals of No Johns II, where I lost in an extremely close game against K-12 The Madchine. Lastly, I used this team to win the last BW OU tour of season thirteen. On both the ladder and in the tournaments, I defeated some top players, proving that this team can hang with the best. BKC's used the team as well, reaching 6th on the ladder with 1568 points. This team has spread around the ladder a fair bit; someone recently asked me if I was using "Princess Bri's team", since she used the team after BKC lent it to her. That pretty much spurred us to make this RMT, since the team has pretty much peaked in effectiveness and I can't stand the thought of it being known as someone else's, so it's time to showcase it and get advice for fixing some of its weaknesses. Enjoy. </p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<div><img src="/download/sprites/bw/455.png" alt="" /></div>
<p><strong>Hippowdon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 16 Def / 240 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Slack Off<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Fang</p>

<p>Most people opt for Tyranitar as their Sandstreamer and Stealth Rocker, but in my opinion, that's a waste of Tyranitar's potential. That, and Hippowdon is just so much better. He is bulky as all hell, and has recovery, which lets him stick around a very long time -- excellent for winning weather wars. Hippo is also not Dugtrio prone, making him much more effective against Drought teams than Tyranitar. Special Defense EVs seem like a waste on a 'mon with such great physical Defense, but they work, since Hippo's high HP balances out his rather poor SpD. With this EV spread, he's able to check SubSplit Gengar rather reliably, and he cannot be OHKO'd by Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor. Everyone's favorite SpD MixTar can barely scratch it with super-effective Ice Beams. However, Hippo is no slacker on the physical side, either; he's able to avoid a 2HKO from Landorus's Earthquake, while Expert Belt-boosted Hidden Power Ice can't 2HKO either, thanks to the SpD investment.</p>

<p><strong>Forretress</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 240 HP / 216 Def / 52 SpA<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Volt Switch<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>This set was recently featured in the twentieth edition of The Smog, but it's has been around for a long time, and it's very effective. Just like 99.99% of teams, this team needed a rapid spinner. Forretress, unlike most rapid spinners, has access to Spikes, which is perfect for this team. On top of that, Forretress has an excellent Defense stat. Volt Switch and Hidden Power Ice help give Forre a "BoltBeam" attacking combination. Volt Switch helps gain offensive momentum and escaping Magnezone's Magnet trapping abilities. And Hidden Power Ice helps against Dragon types, like Salamence and Dragonite, and Ground types like Gliscor and Landorus. The investment of 52 special attack EVs helps Forretress do some "serious damage." No, not really. It helps score 2HKOs on the aforementioned Landorus and Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice. Not only that, it takes a nice chunk out of Gyarados with Volt Switch. Forretress is a great utility mon who has shown surprising offensive capabilities, so BKC and I refer to this guy as "THE BIG SWEEPER."</p>

<p><strong>Jellicent</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Cursed Body<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>This is the premier spin-blocker of BW OU. There are other Ghost-types, of course, but none are as solid as Jellicent at preserving hazards. Gengar is fast and strong, but too frail and is 2HKO'd by pretty much every spinner. Dusclops has a ton of bulk, but it has no recovery and is set-up fodder. Jellicent isn't exactly an offensive force, and it isn't quite as bulky as Dusclops, but it has instant recovery and is a lot harder to set-up on, thanks to Taunt, which also makes a fine stallbreaker in conjunction with Will-o-Wisp. Shadow Ball is used over Scald to actually do something back to Starmie, who Jelli is used to spin-block against. It also helps against stallbreaker Mew. Cursed Body is used over Water Absorb because disabling an opponent's move while Recover stalling has been a life-saver many times. While we initially ran a lot of Speed EVs, we eventually shifted over to max Defense so Tyranitar has a harder time trapping.</p>

<p><strong>Roserade</strong> @ Black Sludge<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 208 HP / 124 Def / 60 SpA / 116 SpD<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Rest</p>

<p>A defensive sandstorm team needs a reliable switch to Rotom-W, preferably one who can also handle its omnipresent partner, Scizor. Roserade performs this task admirably. Burns are shrugged off by Natural Cure, Volt Switch/Hydro Pump barely scratch it, and HP Fire/Ice don't do too much either, thanks to Rossy's high Special Defense. Not to mention, Rossy absorbs Toxic Spikes, which helps Hippowdon and Jellicent's survivability. Thanks to the defense investment, Scizor's Bullet Punch will not KO and HP Fire will often OHKO after Stealth Rock. Most defensive Roserade run a Spiking set of some sort, but since we already had Forretress for Spikes, and T-Spikes aren't always that effective, we figured sticking with this set would be beneficial, and it has yet to let us down. Rest is great recovery since Natural Cure will remove the sleep condition upon switching out. We've used Leaf Storm over Giga Drain for extra power before, but the low PP was off-putting in longer battles.</p>

<p><strong>Jirachi</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Serene Grace<br />
EVs: 16 HP / 216 Atk / 36 SpD / 240 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Iron Head<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Trick</p>

<p>We needed a second Steel-type, and we needed some speed, as our team was slow as dirt. Enter Jirachi, whose revenge-killing capabilities are top-notch. We're running Adamant as the nature because Jirachi's Attack stat leaves something to be desired, and since even with a Jolly nature we can't outspeed Scarf Landorus / Terrakion, Adamant is the way to go. We dropped the Speed EVs low enough to beat Scarf Hydreigon / Haxorus, then added a bit of bulk since this is our main switch to Latios. U-turn is great for gaining switch advantage, and it's excellent at warding off Celebi. Iron Head is Jirachi's signature move that causes ragequits galore. Ice Punch is used because this is our check to Dragon Dance Dragons, such as Dragonite and Haxorus. It also destroys Expert Belt Landorus and opposing AcroBats. </p>

<p><strong>Gliscor</strong> @ Flying Gem<br />
Ability: Sand Veil<br />
EVs: 16 HP / 252 Atk / 64 Def / 176 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Acrobatics</p>

<p>Ah, the star of the show. The very thing this team was built around. The reason for the team's very existence. With a Jolly nature and 176 speed EVs, Gliscor can outspeed Pokemon such as Modest Hydreigon and Adamant Haxorus, reaching a 297 speed stat. Acrobatics does indeed OHKO common Grass-type threats such as Nasty Plot Celebi, Venusaur, and Breloom without any attack boosts. The biggest threat to this set is, of course, Skarmory; great bulk lets it shrug off even Swords Danced attacks and it can either Whirlwind to get rid of the boost.</p>
