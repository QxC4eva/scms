<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to paralyze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While this move is great for defeating Misty's Starmie, it isn't useful for much else, no matter how good Pikachu makes it look. Ditch ThunderShock as soon as you have access to Thunderbolt or any other Electric-type move that deals decent damage.</p>
