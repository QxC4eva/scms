<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Like Dragon Claw to Outrage, Dragon Pulse faces fierce competition from Draco Meteor for the Dragon-type special move of choice. The considerably lower Base Power is alleviated by no drawbacks, making it the most consistent choice. Dragon Pulse is the superior option for late-game sweeping or for strategies involving raising the Special Attack stat, such as on Calm Mind Latias. Typically, some Dragon-types such as Hydreigon will run both Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse on the same set, since there are so many advantages to both that the redundant coverage does not matter.</p>
