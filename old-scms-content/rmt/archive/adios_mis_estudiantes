<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As you probably know, my teams always have some sort of theme to them. However, although this one has a theme, it's very hidden, since I only have 1 UU on my team this time, believe it or not. This is probably the best team I've made (it reached #30 on my Melfice account until I stopped playing a few days ago to try and not fail my midterms).</p>

<p>Basically, the theme is "At least 2 resists to every single type" (immunes count as resists too). I personally think that this is a great theme, since it helps this team switch in on pretty much anything, and it really shows that pokemon is meant to be a team game with the synergy that resistances create. On that note, suggesting changes in moves is perfectly fine, and I may even take your suggestions if you make a good argument for them. However, if you suggest a change in pokemon PLEASE MAKE IT FIT WITH THE THEME! I do not want to mention this several times in this thread or seem like a jackass, but if you cannot understand this stipulation, then do not post here, simple as that.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/490.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Shuca Berry<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>This thing is a tremendous lead. It used to be a ScarfTran, but to honest, I just got sick of the thing and I wanted to try something new. Also, I used to have a Jirachi on this team as my Stealth Rocker, but I shook up my team a lot to make it nice and interesting.</p>

<p>Basically, my strategy is to use Stealth Rock first and get that shit set up. Generally, the only time that I will Fire Blast right off the bat is against an ignorant Scarf Skymin that thinks it can Earth Power Heatran and OHKO. Well wait a minute...Shuca Berry...DENIED! Skymin won't even come close to a OHKO, while Heatran scores a guaranteed OHKO with Fire Blast.</p>

<p>I also really enjoy bringing this thing in a little later in the game against Blisseys. If the opponent has a Blissey, I generally follow this simple rule: Fire Blast first to scout for Protect, and then Explode. This will catch a lot of Blisseys off-guard, and really helps Starmie rip shit up later in the game.</p>

<p>Beating the shit out of other Heatrans is very cool as well. They may come in on your Fire Blast thinking that they can kill you the next turn with Earth Power. Watch the opponent's face as Shuca Berry screws up their Earth Power and stops the OHKO, while your Earth Power cause the opposing Heatran to die a very painful death.</p>

<p><strong>Breloom</strong> @ Toxic Orb<br />
Ability: Poison Heal<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Bulk Up<br />
- Mach Punch<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Spore</p>

<p>Not many people gave this a lot of support when I put it up for a peer edit, though it did make it onto the site with the sister Swords Dance set. However, it is time to show people how much of a beast this thing really is.</p>

<p>I'm inclined to say that the only thing that stop Bulk Up Breloom are very bulky Special Attacking Psychic types. Everything else faces an extreme world of pain when this sets up. After about 2 Bulk Ups it can survive most Explosions, and it can easily take Gliscor's 4x effective Aerial Ace and Spore it. I know what you're thinking. "Ice Beams and Flamethrowers rape this thing". That's very untrue. For your information, it takes a massive 370 Special Attack to guarantee a OHKO on this Breloom with an unSTAB Ice Beam or Flamethrower.</p>

<p>Zapdos can give this occasional problems, but only if it comes in on Mach Punch or Bulk Up. If it comes in on any of the other two moves, it's toast.</p>

<p>However, the main reason why this set is so effective is Breloom's durability. Do not let the low defensive stats fool you, this thing really does have the potential to be quite bulky. If you can't tell, then the reason is that Poison Heal is like double leftovers. After a couple of Bulk Ups, this thing can really take a beating, and won't be losing much health either because of the 12.5% recovery every turn. That, and it can put stuff to sleep at will, which presents a HUGE problem for any slow pokemon/phazer.</p>

<p>This can sweep at any point in the game provided that you can find an opening (isn't very hard since Breloom has a ton of key resistances). But the best time to sweep is lategame. There's lots of parasupport for Breloom so that it can take down fast frail sweepers, but it's also got that deadly Spore, which can secure more and more Bulk Ups each time it's used. The strategy that I like to use is to just bring Breloom on something like Gyarados or Tyranitar, since it can take their attacks with ease, or bring it in on a slow wall, and Spore. Start Bulking Up from there unless you predict something like Zapdos or Skymin coming in. In that case, Stone Edge (requires good prediction to work). Keep racking up the Bulk Ups until you're ready to sweep, but remember to predict strong special attackers, as they can very well ruin your sweep. In the end, most things will perish to Mach Punch and Stone Edge since Mach Punch finishes off frail but strong sweepers, and Stone Edge cleans up the rest. This thing also supports its comrade Heatran by easily taking the Water/Ground weaknesses. </p>

<p>You may be wondering why I am using this over the Swords Dance one. Basically, I feel that the Swords Dance version is way too frail for its own good. The Bulk Up version can at least afford to miss the OHKO once in a while, but the Swords Dance one needs to get those kills on the double, or its in a hell of a lot of trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-C</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 20 Def / 20 SpD / 216 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Trick<br />
- Shadow Ball</p>

<p>This is really the only member that I put on my team to adapt to the platinum metagame, since very little change was needed IMO. I used to have a little Rotom here, but when it got upgraded, I switched without hesitation. Just for clarification, I'm not using Rotom-c for any particular reason, I just like this Rotom the most out of the bunch.</p>

<p>This thing provides a lot of key resistances and immunities, but especially the immunities. Fighting and Ground are such common attacking types nowadays that insurance against them is really needed.</p>

<p>Ok, so the EV spread does look a little odd, so I suppose that I will explain that. First, the Speed EVs give it 430 Speed with Choice Scarf IIRC. This lets it take Gyarados down even after it gets 1 DD. I did not put any Special Attack EVs on it, because it already OHKOs the things it needs to. Eg. Azelf, Gengar. Therefore, I put the EVs into HP and the defenses to make it able to take some nice, strong hits.</p>

<p>Trick screws over walls greatly, and when a wall's generally weak attacks are resisted by either Breloom, Lucario or Starmie, and they're stuck using that attack...it can often mean byebye opposition.</p>

<p>You may be wondering why I am not using Leaf Storm on this thing. The explanation is simple. Double STAB on this thing gets great coverage. But also, I don't really need Leaf Storm, since it would mostly be for Tyranitar. To tell you the truth, it's often to the opponent's dismay to Pursuit my Rotom, because most Pursuit users are Choiced, meaning that they're locked into it. If they Pursuit my Rotom and it gets killed while it's running away, that's the perfect opening for a Lucario sweep, as he 4x resists Dark, and can Swords Dance up and start wreaking havoc thanks to Rotom's sacrifice.</p>

<p><strong>Lucario</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Inner Focus<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Extremespeed</p>

<p>You should all know what this thing does, since it's one of the top sweepers in today's metagame. However, I will explain some of the stuff. The resistances on this thing are so horrendously easy to abuse. Simply bring it in on a resisted attack against something it can kill. Swords Dance while they switch or while they stay in. Annihilate the team. Done. This obviously works best lategame though, since priority sweepers are deadly late in the game (hence why I fuckin have 2 of them).</p>

<p>I chose Crunch over Stone Edge or Ice Punch, simply because everything else can easily take down Gliscor or Gyarados, so there's really no reason that Lucario needs to sacrifice coverage on shit like Cresselia and Dusknoir.</p>

<p>Also, I chose this over Scizor because Lucario's resists fit perfectly into the theme, while Scizor's do not.</p>

<p><strong>Starmie</strong> @ Expert Belt<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Psychic</p>

<p>Ok, so before Deoxys-S was voted uber, I used to have him in here. However, since I can no longer have him, I decided to look for a nice alternative. I thought, it needs to have good coverage, enough defenses to take a decent amount of resisted hits, and it needed to fit with my theme. I came upon Starmie!</p>

<p>If Lucario and Breloom don't succeed in their sweep, this thing can generally just come in and sweep the shit that they couldn't kill. This tends to piss off many people, but that's what I, Bologo do! I gave it Expert Belt instead of Life Orb, since this can hit a hell of a lot of types super effectively, and I personally don't like Life Orb unless it's on something like Lucario who NEEDS the extra damage a lot. Plus, without immunity to Sandstorm, Life Orb simply kills Starmie way too quickly.</p>

<p>I gave it this EV spread, because I just wanted an all-out sweeper Starmie. Max Speed to tie with stuff like Azelf, max Special Attack for that extra oomph, and 4 Def instead of 4 HP so it could come in one extra time on Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>After some testing, I have decided to go with Psychic over Grass Knot.</p>

<p><strong>Lanturn</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Volt Absorb<br />
EVs: 40 HP / 216 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Confuse Ray</p>

<p>Heh, I always have a special niche pokemon on one of my teams, and this time I chose Lanturn. I mainly chose this thing because of its unique set of resistances and its great immunity to Electric. This thing has saved my ass so many times it's not even funny.</p>

<p>First off, my EV spread. 40 HP lets Lanturn reach 401 HP to take a minimum of 5 Seismic Tosses (though I don't usually pit this thing against Blissey anyway unless I just want to screw with the opponent's mind). Now
here comes the interesting part. You know how people find Vaporeon to be pretty physically bulky with 130/60 physical defense? Well, 125/58 isn't much different (yes the Ground weakness is a pain), and Lanturn can take a huge amount of hits, even some non-STAB Earthquakes. Well, I put max Special Defense since this thing is meant to take Special hits like real champ. But then I threw the rest of the EVs in Defense, to make it a mixed wall of sorts.</p>

<p>I like bringing this thing in on stuff like Gengar and Suicune, since they really have a difficult time beating Lanturn, and Lanturn can Thunder Wave them and completely ruin their sweeps. This thing counters a lot of special sweepers, because it resists some very key types. It's even a pretty good CB Scizor switch-in and a great MixApe counter, since it 4x resists Scizor's Bullet Punch, and takes very little from MixApe's special attacks (grass knot is extremely weak on Lanturn), with only Combat having a chance to 2HKO. Keep in mind that I did try investing some Speed in this thing to outspeed Skarmory, but I really find it to be worthless. Lanturn's going to beat Skarmory either way, so I'd much rather have some more walling ability than waste EVs on Speed.</p>

<p>Now for the actual moves. Thunder Wave is generally just useful, and having 2 paralysis inducers on the team is even more useful. It's just not hard to set up a sweep when the opponent can't move. Thunder Wave also works with Confuse Ray for an effective Parafusion combo. Parafusion is amazingly effective on Lanturn since it can take both types of attacks pretty well, and it's got great coverage to go along with it. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam give Lanturn the good coverage to compensate for the mediocre special attack, and lets it pound on things while predicting with Thunder Wave. I'm NOT REMOVING this one either.</p>
