<p>Inflicts intensifying poison on the target. This does damage equal to max(floor(max HP/16), 1) * min(# of turns Pokemon has taken Toxic damage, 15). This has the effect of doing 1/16 max HP damage the first turn, 2/16 max HP on the second turn, then 3/16 on the third, etc., adding 1/16 to the damage each turn. It maxes out at 15/16 max HP damage.</p>
