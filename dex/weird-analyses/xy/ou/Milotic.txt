Overview
########
Milotic is an example of one of few Pokemon that enjoys the use of Defog, as like Bisharp and Thundurus, it can switch in to the move and get what is essentially a free Nasty Plot boost, thanks to its ability Competitive. What separates Miotic from Bisharp, Thundurus, and other Pokemon that use Defiant, is that Milotic is a special attacker, which allows it to beat two of the more common Defog users, Skarmory and Mandibuzz, which are most commonly physically defensive. It also obtains its Competitive boost from Sticky Web and Intimidate, giving it no shortage of options that it can switch in on, and it hits incredibly hard with a Life Orb after a boost from Competitive. It also has really good special bulk and the ability to reliably heal itself with the Recover. It isn't all easy for Milotic though, as it relies on teams with Defog, Sticky Web, or Intimidate users to actually become powerful; it simply doesn't hit hard enough without a boost. Its physical bulk also isn't great in comparison to its special bulk, which means it is often prey to powerful physical attackers.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Recover
ability: Competitive
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========
- Hydro Pump is the most spammable move; it does a ton of damage at +2 to most neutral foes and is almost always a guaranteed OHKO against enemies it is super effective against.
- Ice Beam allows Milotic to hit bulky Grass-types and Dragon-types that resist Hydro Pump.
- Hidden Power Grass hits Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Manaphy.
- Hidden Power Fire hits Ferrothorn.
- Recover simply provides recovery, to keep Milotic around longer.
- Dragon Pulse is an option to kit Kyurem-B on the switch-in, as well after surviving its Fusion Bolt if running a max HP spread.

Set Details
========
- Life Orb boosts Milotic's power while still allowing it to change moves.
- 252 Attack and 252 Speed is standard for a special sweeper.
- A Modest nature makes Milotic as powerful as possible.
- A Timid nature allows Milotic to outspeed Jolly Mamoswine, Jolly Mega Heracross, and Adamant Excadrill.
- An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD (which should only be used with Modest) allows Milotic to withstand attacks much better. It also means that Milotic can switch into Sticky Web to obtain a Competitive boost without its Speed investment becoming redundant.

Usage Tips
========
- Milotic has to switch into Defog or Intimidate to be powerful, so you must predict carefully otherwise Milotic won't be as effective on your team.
- Take advantage of the Competitive boost by predicting when you attack, so you can break through foes on the second hit if they switch in on a super effective attack.
- Recover is not only good for scouting what move an opponent will make, but also for using when you have the opportunity or when you force a switch.

Team Options
========
- Deoxys-D or Deoxys-S to set up hazards, so the opponent is pressured to use Defog.
- Aegislash with an Air Balloon to prevent Rapid Spin users from taking away the hazards, so that the opponent's team has to use Defog to clear the hazards. This example works the best on HO teams, but other spinblockers can be used if necessary.
- Terrakion, Keldeo, or Conkeldurr to clear Chansey, Blissey, and Kyuerm-B. Keldeo and Terrakion both fit into a Hyper Offensive team mold, but be weary that Keldeo adds another weakness to the Electric- and Grass-types, while Terrakion only adds a weakness to the Grass-type.

Other Options
########
- A Defensive set is viable, as Milotic has insane special bulk, but it faces extreme competition with Vaporeon, Gastrodon, Slowbro, Slowking, and Suicune.
- A RestTalk set works great in conjunction with Milotic's ability Marvel Scale, but it faces competition with Suicune, which has Calm Mind to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense.
- Haze is a nice option to clear stat boosts from a foe.
- An Assault Vest set with Competitive allows Milotic to tank attacks from powerful special attackers such as Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y, but it lacks the ability to restore its health with Recover.

Checks & Counters
########
- Chansey can wall Milotic.
- Blissey can also wall Milotic.
- Kyurem-B can OHKO 4 HP Milotic with Fusion Bolt, as well as switch in on anything at +2 except for the rare Dragon Pulse.
- Thundurus and Thundurus-T can revenge kill it with Thunderbolt.
- Assault Vest Raikou can also revenge kill it with Thunderbolt, while tanking its attacks quite nicely.
- Ferrothorn can wall sets without Hidden Power Fire, and set up hazards or use Leech Seed.
