Overview
########
- Rain no longer being permanent and the introduction of new Pokemon (e.g. Greninja) have given it more competition. Fairies were also introduced.
- Decent bulk and typing are what set it apart from the likes of Greninja.
Talonflame also makes its life harder, OHKOing Keldeo before it has the chance to do anything
- A very shallow movepool which creates a reliance on Hidden Power or weak moves for coverage.
- Great base 129 Special Attacker and good base 108 Speed.
- Multiple options (Specs / Scarf / CM) to use with Keldeo.
- Its signature move, Secret Sword, allows it to bypass special walls. This is something it also has over other special attackers.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Secret Sword
move 3: Hidden Power Flying / Scald
move 4: Icy Wind
item: Choice Specs / Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
- Hydro Pump is the main STAB option and Keldeo's most powerful attack.
- Secret Sword, which also allows it to bypass specially bulky Pokemon, is a reliable secondary STAB option.
- Hidden Power Flying provides neutral coverage and beats its otherwise best check: Mega Venusaur. It also lets Keldeo hit Gourgeist, Trevenant, and Celebi.
- Scald can be used as it is still relatively powerful, while also having a large chance to burn, which can cripple a large majority of Keldeo's common switch-ins
- Icy Wind slows down opponents such as Latios, Starmie, and Latias on the switch and only has 5 less BP than Hidden Power Ice. It hits Dragon- and Grass-types super effectively.

Set Details
========
- Choice Specs are for maximum damage, but Life Orb is an option if you want Keldeo to be able to switch moves.
- Timid nature to make use of its pretty good Speed tier and be as fast as possible.
- Expert Belt to feign a Choice item and be able to switch moves.
- Scald is useful for cleaning up later in the game due to its perfect accuracy.

Usage Tips
========
- Keldeo is best used mid- to late-game, as its powerful special attacks can 2HKO/OHKO a majority of the metagame after some prior damage. Its high speed also helps it clean up the foe's team.
- Still works very well early-game, as its high-powered STAB attacks can weaken the foe's team, making it easier for Pokemon such a Swords Dance Scizor to sweep.
- Great switch in to most Rock-, Fire-, and Steel-types thanks to its decent bulk and defensive typing. It can threaten many of these Pokemon with a STAB Hydro Pump and Secret Sword

Team Options
========
- Deoxys-S and Deoxys-D are great partners, as the hazard support they provide weakens many of Keldeo's checks, making it much easier for Keldeo to wallbreak or sweep.
- Politoed is another great partner, as it can provide Keldeo with Rain support, making its Hydro Pump much stronger.
- If Politoed is not being used as a partner, then Heatran become a viable partner, as it checks many Pokemon that threaten Keldeo, Such as Trevenent, Talonflame, Goodra, and Mega Venusaur.
- Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus make great partners for Keldeo as well, as they are able to check bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Jellicent, while also providing momentum for Keldeo with Volt Switch.
- Scizor can also provide Keldeo with momentum in the form of U-Turn, while also checking Fairy- and Dragon-types such as Sylveon and Latias fairly well.
- Aegislash and Tyranitar are also good partners, as both can defeat a large majority of Keldeo's common counters such as Latios and Celebi.
