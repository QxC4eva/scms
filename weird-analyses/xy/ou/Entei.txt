Overview
########
- Got Sacred Fire with the transition to XY.
- Sacred Fire has 50% Burn Chance and 100 BP which can cripple its normal counters such as Garchomp.
- Good Base 115 Attack and 100 Speed allows it to use this move well.
- Pretty bulky too and resistance to Fairy-type is useful.
- Access to Extremespeed lets it smoke fast threats and makes it a good revenge-killer.
- Rain nerf makes Sacred Fire a better move now.
- Stealth Rock weak, but buff to Defog makes it a somewhat lesser issue.
- Fire-typing gives it common weakness to Ground-, Water-, and Rock-type.
- Poor coverage moves.
- The "Volcano Pokemon" lacks Earthquake and also relies on Stone Edge for coverage.
- Remains a powerful threat if you play to its advantages.

Choice Band
########

name: Choice Band
move 1: Sacred Fire
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Bulldoze
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Sacred Fire is main STAB move and hits ridiculously hard with Choice Band and its burn chance gives it a way to cripple its switch-ins such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, Garchomp, Salamence, and Azumarill.
- Extremespeed + Choice Band is a great revenge-killing tool. 
- Stone Edge hits hard and provides a way to kill Talonflame, Noivern, Salamence, and hit Rotom-W for some solid damage on the switch.
- Bulldoze is used for Heatran as it OHKOes after Stealth Rock (iirc with CB, not Assault Vest) and Aggron before it has Mega Evolved, but has limited usage outside of that.

Set Details
========
- A Choice Band set needs max Atk and Spe. 
- Adamant Nature because Extremespeed requires. 
- You can use Life Orb, but it doesn't complement its bulk, but it can easily pick off switch-ins with the combination of Sacred Fire + Extremespeed.

Usage Tips
========
- Sacred Fire should be used a soon as it gets a chance.
- Sticky Web Galavantula has good synergy with this thing and it can slow down targets for it to kill like.
- It can run a mixed CB set utilizing Overheat as its Special Move to do massive damage to Mega Aggron for example.
- Extreme Speed late-game when everything is weakened.
- Removing ghost-types is good so Extremespeed doesn't become a liability.

Team Options
========
- Deoxys-S makes hazards for easy Extremespeed abuse and Entei forces lots of switches, so the hazards help.
- Calm Mind Latias appreciates the physical attackers burned.
- Mega Charizard Y provides Sun Support for it to send off stronger Sacred Fires.
- Blissey walls like everything if you burn the physical attackers on your opponent's team.
- Thundurus-I can paralyze faster threats and can switch into Earthquakes aimed at Entei.
- Spinners such as Excadrill and Mega Blastoise are good teammates, Latios has good synergy with entei and can defog away troublesome hazards.

Other Options
########
- AV set can be used as a mixed Tank, but the damage output is rather disappointing and it is worn down easily, but it is a solid option to be considered on bulkier teams.
- Extrasensory and Eruption on a special set.
- Calm Mind, but Entei should really be relying on its physical moves.

Checks and Counters
########
- Heatran can come in easily, but needs to watch out for Bulldoze.
- Many of its Checks are crippled by Burn, but powerful Special Attackers such as Choice Specs Latios can do massive damage even if Entei is using Assault Vest.
- Stealth Rock will weaken it, same with Spikes, this thing will switch a lot.
- Rotom-W, Greninja, and Mega Blastoise force it out easily.
- Rain lowers the power of Entei's STAB moves.
- CM Clefable and Reuniclus can set-up on the AV set and don't mind burn thanks to Magic Guard.
- Moltres can roost pressure stall out Sacred Fire.
- Sacred Fire has a measly 8 PP, so pressure from the likes of Deoxys-D and stalling using Flash Fire can drain its PP out fast.
- Lum Berry Dragonite can come in easily, take very little damage, and kill a weakened Entei with Outrage.
- Mega Charizard X is immune to Burn and 4x resists Sacred Fire.
- Entei has trouble breaking past Rotom-H as well.
- Paralysis can ruin it as its speed helps outpace some of the threats that can do massive damage to it such as Mamoswine + Hydreigon.
