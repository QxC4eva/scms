[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder's Attack stat cannot be lowered. Does not block self-inflicted Attack drops, such as the Attack drop from <a href="/bw/moves/superpower">Superpower</a>. It also does not block the effects of <a href="/bw/moves/haze">Haze</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/heart_swap">Heart Swap</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/power_swap">Power Swap</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Hyper Cutter is a great ability for any physical attacking Pokemon that wants an immunity from having its precious Attack being dropped, which could potentially be the difference between a successful sweep and an abysmal failure. However, its use is exceedingly situational, as <a href="/bw/abilities/intimidate">Intimidate</a> is not as popular as it used to be, so the residual Attack drops are not as common as they were in past generations. What's more, no Pokemon outside of <a href="/bw/pokemon/xatu">Xatu</a> and <a href="/bw/abilities/prankster">Prankster</a> <a href="/bw/pokemon/murkrow">Murkrow</a> uses Attack-lowering moves such as <a href="/bw/moves/growl">Growl</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/featherdance">FeatherDance</a> intentionally, and instead favor the Attack-lowering side effect of burns, which Hyper Cutter does not bypass. Still, <a href="/bw/pokemon/kingler">Kingler</a> makes use of it, since <a href="/bw/abilities/shell_armor">Shell Armor</a> is even more situational and not as useful.</p>
