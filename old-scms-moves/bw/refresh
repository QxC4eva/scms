Removes status from the user.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cures the user of its major status problem. Fails if the user does not have a status. Cannot cure temporary status effects, such as confusion.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Refresh is a rare move that is kinda useful for dealing with status. It is most often found on Arceus and Latias. It is usually most useful on a last-Pokemon late-game sweeper, where Toxic poison and other status can be the one thing standing in between a loss and a clean sweep. A great example of Refresh at work can be found in <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3464979">this warstory</a> by user shrang.</p>
