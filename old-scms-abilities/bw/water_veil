<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder cannot be burned. If the wielder is burned, it is instantly cured of burn.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Decent at best, Water Veil sees little to no use in the competitive scenario. Every Pokemon with access to it has better options such as <a href="/bw/abilities/swift_swim">Swift Swim</a>, <a href="/bw/abilities/storm_drain">Storm Drain</a>, or <a href="/bw/abilities/water_absorb">Water Absorb</a>. <a href="/bw/pokemon/floatzel">Floatzel</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/huntail">Huntail</a>, who could benefit from the immunity to burn, will prefer having their Speed doubled in rain.</p>
