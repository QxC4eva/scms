<h2>History</h2>

<p>When Slowking was first introduced in GSC, it was seen as  almost  entirely outclassed by its awkward, less noble brother  Slowbro. Therefore,  it was only really used in GSC UU. In ADV, it  continued to be  outclassed by Slowbro, but it managed to be one of the  top bulky  Water-types of ADV UU, so not much change there.</p>

<p>In DPP, when Slowbro finally dropped from BL to UU, Slowking  was  pushed into NU. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing however,  because  after Entei and Espeon were banned, it was one of the best  Pokemon of  DPP NU. This was a pretty good time for Slowking.</p>

<p>Then in BW, 2 things happened. First off, RU was made; it was a  tier  where Slowking could finally be used to its full potential.  Secondly, it  got an amazing ability in Regenerator, allowing it to get  one-third of  its health back every time it switched out, which is very  useful for a  support Pokemon. Even when there were tons of Dark- and  Bug-types,  Nidoqueen, and competition from Cresselia, it was still used  a lot due  to its unpredictability, great stats, great typing, and Regenerator.  It's been a staple of RU ever since R1 and R2 when it was "rediscovered" and brought out of NU.  Now it's arguably the best  Water-type in RU since it consistently  beats most Fire- and  Fighting-types. It's become the king of RU (at  least by usage).</p>

<h2>Slowking's Qualities</h2>

<p>Slowking is a Pokemon gifted with great defenses, decent  offenses, and  an amazing movepool. Its defenses are, simply put,  incredible, allowing  it to switch in on many resisted and neutral hits.  Its low Speed and  good Special Attack also allow it to utilize Trick Room extremely well.  All in all, it has one of the best stat distributions of RU.</p>

<p>Regenerator is an epic ability. It allows Slowking to switch in  and out  constantly, making it an amazing pivot. This ability is what  separates  Slowking from its other bulky Water peers, such as Qwilfish  and  Poliwrath; while they can only switch into certain threats once,   Slowking can switch in repeatedly. Also, Regenerator allows Slowking to   take Pursuits much better. Furthermore, if you make a mistake, such as   switching in on a Choice-locked Electric move, Slowking can switch out   and come back in later to neutralize other threats.</p>

<p>Slowking's movepool gives it a wide variety of support moves,  such as  Thunder Wave, Toxic, Trick Room, and Trick. Unlike a lot of  bulky  Water-types, it also gets a reliable recovery in Slack Off. Its  offensive moves include the bulky Water staple Scald, the Bug-  and Grass-burning  Fire Blast (seriously, how many Water-types get Fire  Blast?), a  secondary STAB in Psyshock, and the always useful boosting  move Nasty  Plot. Its movepool makes it so that you can predict as hard  as you  want, but unless you have a Lum Berry, whatever you're switching into  it may get poisoned, burned, or paralyzed. This throws a wrench into   the cogs of teams that rely on Durant, Gallade, Absol, Spiritomb, or   other Pokemon in the same vein to check it. These are the reasons why Slowking is #1  in usage.</p>

<h2>Playing with Slowking</h2>

<div class="float-right"><img src="/smog/issue27/ruspotlight_slowking.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>When using Slowking, there are normally 3 set  options to choose from:  standard defensive, Trick Room, and Choice  Specs. The defensive set gets  the most use and can switch in on most  neutral attacks. It's extremely  easy to use, mainly because all you  have to do is switch in on half the  tier, force them out, and use a  status move, Fire Blast, or Psyshock,  based on what you think they'll switch in. There are reasons why this is  one of the most used sets in RU.</p>

<p>The Trick Room set can be played in 2 ways: focusing on  Slowking  sweeping in Trick Room with Nasty Plot boosts or with 3  attacks + Life  Orb. I recommend the 3 attack + Life Orb set, since it  gives you more  turns to utilize Trick Room, and you also get more  coverage. Either way,  both of them are excellent sweepers.</p>

<p>The third set isn't seen too often, but it is actually very  underrated,  since it is able to switch in and hit hard before switching  out to  regain health. Most of its usual switch-ins are either 2HKOed  or OHKOed.  It can also Trick the Choice Specs onto slow walls. Choosing  a Slowking  set depends on what you need. If you want a pivot or a  wall, use the  defensive set; if you want a Trick Room sweeper, use the Trick Room set  (I hope you already knew that); and if you want a hard-hitting pivot, use  the Choice Specs set.</p>

<h2>Playing against Slowking</h2>

<p>When countering Slowking, you ought to try to find out what set  it's  running. It's usually the defensive set, but just assuming that  at the  beginning can cost you the battle. The best way to get rid of  Slowking  is Toxic and entry hazards. Entry hazards are very annoying  since  Slowking has to do a lot of switching. Believe it or not, Entei  is able  to 2HKO Slowking after some prior damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes.  Toxic is dangerous because the indirect damage really racks up.</p>

<p>Escavalier is a great counter. With Pursuit and Megahorn, it can OHKO  Slowking regardless of whether it switches or stays in. Pursuit does  50% even if Slowking doesn't switch. Escavalier  can easily switch in on  status moves since it's immune to Toxic and  doesn't mind paralysis. When  you switch in Escavalier, you ought to consider switching  out immediately to see if  Slowking is running Fire Blast. If not, then  you can safely switch back  in on it. Also, be wary of Scald  burns.</p>

<p>Pokemon that carry Lum Berries, such as Absol, Durant, and  Lilligant,  are able to switch in and kill Slowking right away. The  ability to  predict around status will be very useful. Electric- and  Grass-types,  such as Galvantula, Tangrowth, and Sceptile, can just blow  it out of the  water. Manectric  deserves a special mention due to its ability to switch  in on Thunder  Wave and get a free Special Attack boost. Pursuit users  are pretty good  counters to Slowking, specifically the aforementioned  Escavalier, Drapion, and Spiritomb.</p>

<p>Ironically, if you want to wall Slowking, Slowking itself is a  great  candidate. These battles usually take forever, but if one of them   is carrying Toxic, they will most likely win. It's interesting to see a  battle between two Slowking that both have Toxic.</p>

<h2>Fitting Slowking on your team</h2>

<p>To best summarize the teams Slowking is great on, I must quote  my good  friend Jellicent: "Slowking has long been one of the best 'mons  in RU.  Works on stall, offense, balance, hail, TR, whatever." Yes,  Slowking  virtually fits on all teams. If you're having trouble fitting  Slowking  on your team, you're either running a sun team or using a  different  bulky Water-type for some unfathomable reason. (Just kidding:  some bulky  Water-types can be used over Slowking on certain teams.)  Slowking, however, does like the help of Ground-types to absorb Electric  attacks  and counter Drapion. Also, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and other  Regenerator users are good  partners, because while they aren't as good  as they used to be,  Regenerator cores are still viable.</p>

<p>Slowking can basically fill any role on a  team. Wall? Check.  Pivot?  Check. Sweeper? Check. Hole puncher? Check. Staller? Check. Very  few  other Pokemon can fill all of these roles. Escavalier is a great partner  for the Trick Room set, since it is arguably the best Trick Room sweeper   in RU. Other good partners for the Trick Room set include Druddigon,   Bouffalant, and Aggron. These Pokemon can all help Slowking break   through its threats or just capitalize on  Trick Room itself. The Specs set  appreciates entry hazards, so  Smeargle or Crustle are great partners.  This set also struggles to get  past other Slowking if it's locked into a  move and can't use Trick, so  having one of the aforementioned counters  as a partner would be useful.  The great thing about Slowking is that it  needs almost no support  whatsoever. It's that good.</p>

<h2>Get out there!</h2>

<p>Slowking is the King of RU for a reason, and all in all it's an  amazing  Pokemon. Being unpredictable and a great team supporter is  great, so  really there are only a handful of reasons you shouldn't use  it.  Slowking is an excellent Pokemon that almost every team should  use!</p>
