Overview
########
- Gothitelle's ability Shadow Tag allows it to easily trap and dispatch threats to a team making it a valuable teammate in many different teams. Unlike its cousin Wobbuffet, it actually has some form of offensive presence.
- Its reasonable special move pool allows Gothitelle to tailor it to take down certain threats, and lets it dismantle cores of common defensive threats such as Mega Venusaur, Skarmory, and Heatran. This lets it beat stall teams incredibly well.
- It can also revenge kill members of offensive teams.
- It has average stats overall, with nothing particularly standout aside from an above average Special Defense.
- Its Psychic-typing is quite bad defensively.

Set Details
========
- The main goal of this set is to trap and eliminate the Pokemon in defensive cores to allow a sweeper to sweep after they have been removed.
- The item is Choice Specs to give it the power to break through these cores more easily.
- Max Speed and Special Attack investment is used because it is standard for an offensive special attacker.
- Timid is the nature of choice to outrun Adamant Breloom.
- Modest can be used with a spread of 212 HP / 252 SpA / 44 Spe to outspeed minimum Speed Skarmory while investing the rest of the EVs in HP for extra bulk.

Usage Tips
========
- Get Gothitelle in safely by means of U-turn / Volt Switch / After a KO, don't bring it in on attacks, especially physical ones, unless resisted.
- It has modest special bulk, so for things like Rotom-W that it can only 2HKO, it can afford to take a hit from.
- Playing with Gothitelle doesn't require much prediction, as the foe can't switch out. This allows the user to not have to worry about mindgames.
- Gothitelle simply wrecks stall teams. Just switch it in, KO a Pokemon, switch out, then come back in again.
- Don't trap anything while the other team has a Pursuit user, as they will be able to KO Gothitelle back straight away.
- The sight of Gothitelle in team preview could lead the opponent to making strange double switches to avoid being trapped. This is easy to take advantage of.

Team Options
========
- Volt Switch and U-turn to allow Gothitelle to come in easily. Examples of Pokemon which can use these moves include Scizor, Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Jirachi.
- Sticky Web setters are good teammates because they allow Gothitelle to trap a much wider range of threats, as it will outspeed them and be able to KO them without risk of being damaged in the process. The most viable users are Smeargle and Galvantula.
- Rapid Spin and Defog are helpful because Gothitelle switches a lot to trap foes. Latios, Latias, Starmie, and Excadrill are good choices.
- Teammates that require certain threats gone are the main Pokemon that benefit from Gothitelle's presence.
- Thundurus and many other special sweepers appreciate the removal of Chansey.
- Manaphy (if running Energy Ball over Psychic) and Azumarill appreciate the removal of Mega Venusaur.
- Mega Tyranitar appreciates the removal of Hippowdon and Skarmory.
- Physical setup sweepers such as Terrakion and Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X appreciate the removal of Quagsire.

Other Options
########
- A Choice Scarf allows Gothitelle to revenge kill faster, offensive Pokemon, but it isn't very powerful.
- A Calm Mind set allows Gothitelle to set up Calm Minds on Pokemon that can't touch it, and then sweep a team, though this is difficult with such a low Speed stat.
- An All-Out Attacker with Expert Belt or Life Orb gives Gothitelle the freedom to switch moves.

Checks & Counters
########
- Because of its ability Shadow Tag, Gothitelle has no actual counters, as the definition of a counter requires the foe to be able to switch in on the Pokemon. However, the trapping can be avoided with U-turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass, the use of the item Shed Shell, or simply the fact that Ghost-types can't be trapped.
- Pursuit users such as Scizor and Tyranitar can easily revenge kill Gothitelle after it takes down a foe. Scizor can be KOed by Hidden Power Fire though, so only try to Pursuit trap Gothitelle if it is locked into another move.
- U-turn users can escape from the clutches of Gothitelle, as well as damage it heavily or KO it in the process. Examples include Landorus-T, Scizor (if Gothitelle lacks Hidden Power Fire), and Jirachi.
- Gothitelle can easily be revenged by fast offensive Pokemon such as Gengar, Thundurus, or Talonflame.
- Aegislash can hit Gothitelle hard with Shadow Ball or Shadow Sneak, can switch out if it is it low health thank to its Ghost-typing, and doesn't take much damage from Gohtitelle's attacks.
