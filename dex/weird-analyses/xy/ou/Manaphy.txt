Overview
########
Manaphy has always been a massive threat, thanks to its access to one of the best boosting moves in the game: Tail Glow. Reaching +3 Special Attack in a single turn is nothing to sneeze at, and when combined with Manaphy's respectable 100 base stats across the board and its movepool that seems to fit its role perfectly, it becomes one of the most terrifying sweepers in the game. But Manphy's potential doesn't stop there. While it's ability, Hydration, may seem somewhat useless at first due to the rain nerf, a mono-attacking set with Calm Mind with Rest and Rain Dance is truly threatening. Add on the fact that Manaphy can be a wonderful lure for Mega Venusaur with Psychic and Thundurus with a Wacan Berry, and you'll soon understand how Manaphy earns its slot on your team.

Tail Glow
########
name: Tail Glow
move 1: Tail Glow
move 2: Surf
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Energy Ball / Psychic
ability: Hydration
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Tail Glow is the ultimate special setup move, boosting Manaphy's special attack by 3 stages.
- Surf is the STAB option of choice, being both accurate and powerful.
- Ice Beam is good for hitting Grass and Dragon types that resist Surf.
- Energy Ball for Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and other bulky Water-types.
- Scald can be used over Surf but it misses a few KOs.
- Psychic can be used over Energy Ball to hit Rotom-W for 2HKO and also OHKO Mega Venusaur.

Set Details
========
- The choice between Leftovers and LO comes down to whether survivability or power is more important.
- Wacan Berry could be used to lure Thundurus, survive a Thunderbolt, and OHKO back with Ice Beam after a boost.
- A bulkier spread can be used of 90 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 162 Spd with a Modest nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Excadrill.

Usage Tips
========
- Best used as either a wallbreaker/lure (for Rotom-W) early game, or a late-game cleaner.
- Works extremely well with Sticky Web support due to its main counters being faster Pokemon.
- Make sure to take out Pokemon like Thundurus before sweeping, since it's faster and immune to Sticky Web.
- Powerful wallbreakers work really well with it, Mega Garchomp and other mixed or strong attackers can break down special walls for it.

Team Options
========
- Sticky Web support is huge so Galvantula works well as a partner, also outspeeds and does huge damage to faster threats to Manaphy like Garchomp, Terrakion, Mega Pinsir, etc.
- Something to deal with Blissey and Chansey such as LO Latios with Psyshock works well (also helps with Thundurus).
- Strong Fighting types such as Terrakion, Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Infernape also deal with Blissey and Chansey well.
- Rain support is welcome but not necessary.
- Magnezone can easily trap Ferrothorn and OHKO it with Hidden Power Fire.
- Mamoswine can help wear down Ferro and deal with Thundurus.
- Non Mold Breaker Excadrill love Manaphy's ability to lure in and OHKO Rotom-W.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Rest
move 3: Rain Dance
move 4: Scald
ability: Hydration
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 236 Def / 20 Spe

Moves
========
- Calm Mind boosts SpD and SpA easily thanks to Manaphy's great bulk.
- Rest in combination with Hydration can heal Manaphy completely when running low on health.
- Rain Dance allows Manaphy to set up its own rain if necessary.
- Scald is a solid STAB option, and can wear down opponents with burn.

Set Details
========
- Enough Speed to outspeed neutral nature base 70s, the rest is put in bulk.
- Leftovers is highly recommended in terms of items to increase survivability, but LO can be used if on a dedicated rain team.
- With Life Orb, +6 Manaphy can 2HKO even Chansey with Surf.
- If a middle ground between power and survivability is desired, Mystic Water can be used as the item.

Usage Tips
========
- This set makes an excellent cleaner, but is bulkier than the first set.
- Works well against defensive teams more than offensive.
- Setting up against walls is advisable.

Team Options
========
- Politoed is a great partner for providing rain
- Pokemon to deal with Thundurus such as Latias or Mamoswine can work well too.
- Mega Venusaur forms really great core with this.
- Heatran also works well with Manaphy to cover weaknesses, but isn't a great choice if Politoed is used.

Other Options
########
- Rain setter for rain teams with U-turn for momentum.
- Tail Glow+Rest set for rain teams.
- Scarf set, but is mainly outclassed by other Scarfers (Rotom-W) due to a general lack of power when unboosted.
- Heart Swap is an interesting move to take advantage of setup sweepers, but it's rather gimmicky and hard to pull off.

- Mega Venusaur
