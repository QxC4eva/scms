<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to burn the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Ember is a rather useless move competitively: it sits at 40 Base Power, which means there is no reason it use it over Flamethrower or Fire Blast, both of which also have a 10% chance to burn the target and are more powerful. Most, if not all, Pokemon that get Ember also have Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p>
