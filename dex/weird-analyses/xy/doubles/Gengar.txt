Mega Gengar
########
set name: Mega Gengar
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Focus Blast / Sludge Bomb
move 3: Taunt / Sludge Bomb
move 4: Protect
item: Gengarite
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
- Shadow Ball is the main move of this set, hitting extremely hard
- Focus Blast has perfect neutral coverage against everything, but Sludge Bomb is more accurate and hits Fairies
- Taunt is great utility, but Sludge Bomb should be used in this slot if you want to run all-out offensive Megagar
- Protect is a great move in dubs for scouting / playing around, etc etc

Set Details
========
- Running maximum Speed is important to outspeed and knock out Shaymin-S.
- Will-O-Wisp is amazing for catching and crippling physical attackers off guard, especially Bisharp and Kangaskhan, mons that usually would use Sucker Punch against a Gengar.

Usage Tips
========
- Great Trick Room counter with a powerful STAB Shadow Ball to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types. Taunt works against Trick Room very well too.
- Mega Gengar should be used and its set customised accordingly to counter threats that your team has trouble with, since it can easily remove these Pokemon through trapping.

Team Options
========
- Fighting-types make amazing partners to Gengar, as Mega Gengar can trap and KO troubling Ghost- and Psychic-types. Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Hitmontop can also deal with Dark-types, notably Tyranitar and Bisharp, who trouble Gengar.
- Most Pokemon can take huge advantage of the utility Mega Gengar provides, as long as Mega Gengar is customed to trap and kill specific threats that trouble these teammates.

Other Options
########

- Destiny Bond is a great last resort of taking an opposing Pokemon down as they attack Gengar.
- Hidden Power Ice or Icy Wind works well for taking care of Landorus-T and Garchomp, but is very situational.

Check & Counters
########

- Dark-types are a huge pain unless Gengar is running Focus Blast. Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Bisharp completely wall it otherwise.
- Powerful or super-effective priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird or any Sucker Punch user are very problematic for Gengar, as they can easily exploit its weak Defense stat.
- Generally bulky Pokemon that are not weak to its STABs have a general advantage; Pokemon such as Charizard-Y, Rotom-W, and Assault Vest Conkeldurr have no problems in dealing with Gengar.
