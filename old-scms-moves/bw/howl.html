<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Howl is outclassed by Swords Dance, and should only be used when the latter is unavailable. There are a few Pokemon that find use in this move, such as Arcanine and Stoutland, who can sweep reasonably well with it. However, most players opt for the power of a Choice Band instead of Howl, due to the fact that use of a Choice Band means that the player doesn't have to waste a time setting up and can attack right off the bat. What's more, Howl takes up a moveslot, which could be used instead for another coverage move.</p>
