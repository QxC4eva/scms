Switches user's stat changes with target's.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Swaps all of the user's stat changes with the target's. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Manaphy's signature attack isn't the most exciting thing out there. Reversing a sweep with a timely Heart Swap can be pretty amusing, but that would only be of use if your opponent had nabbed a huge number of Calm Mind boosts. Speed boosters can outrun and KO Manaphy, while Attack boosters can raise their offensive stats again after Manaphy uses Heart Swap. Stick to boosting with the far more consistent Calm Mind or Tail Glow instead.</p>
