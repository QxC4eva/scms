<h3>Umbreon</h3>

<p>Hold up, sun! Let the Umbreon in.<br />
Imma shed some Moonlight on the power within.<br />
Your Swords Dance game is your ultimate doom.<br />
I play dirty my dude, 'cause when I walk in the room<br />
I call it Foul Play. Whoops! I dented your strat.<br />
I'm taking over my man. It's 'cause you got no tact.<br />
As a matter of fact, I'm backing up my team.<br />
I Wish a sweeper would try to crush my dreams!<br />
'Cause when I Toxic, I rock this. Come touch this Special D, shit<br />
I'm wallin' like a rock. Whattup! You keep fallin' like a top. Get up!<br />
Protectin' all my comrades and leavin' haters so mad,<br />
I guess my trainer's so glad that I spanked yo sweeper so bad!</p>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/smog/issue34/pokerap_espeon.png" alt=""/></div>

<h3>Espeon</h3>

<p>Don't messpeon with my Espeon.<br />
'Cause my OU tricks will finish you quick.<br />
You're chasing me and pursuing my butt<br />
like I don't pass batons when I'm stuck in a rut.<br />
Bitchin' 'bout switch-ins, always predictin' yet missin',<br />
and you're still hittin' with mittens like Pok&eacute;bitches in kitchens.<br />
I keep storing. I'm whoring all of my stat boosts. In Hoenn,<br />
I take down Swampert and Golem with all my Grass Knots, I'm soarin'<br />
over the Scizor like "damn, my HP Fire is glam!"<br />
Mind my calmness. I'm on this. Don't be so Psyshocked. I am<br />
the inner core of my groupies. I hold my own and I do me<br />
so please do you, fellow homies. Flex all your strength and come show me!</p>

<h3>Glaceon</h3>

<p>Let it go.<br />
This battle was over before it began.<br />
I hate to be so cold, but the truth must stand.<br />
Just look. You're frozen.<br />
How could you match up?<br />
You're all shaking with fear, so how could you catch up?<br />
I'm spittin' fire and ice. Call me Robert Frost.<br />
You can't battle when you know the war is lost.<br />
My breath is scary. Don't bother boostin' all of your stats.<br />
It's critical you realize you can't win with that.<br />
You'll throw rocks of stealth, but I'm not afraid of your boulders.<br />
I'll leave your team in a Blizzard and give them all the cold shoulder.</p>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/smog/issue34/pokerap_leafeon.png" alt=""/></div>

<h3>Leafeon</h3>

<p>Pok&eacute;mon hustlin',<br />
Pok&eacute;mon tusslin',<br />
and my Leafeon's musclin'<br />
while your jimmies stay rustlin'.<br />
I guess Speed doesn't matter<br />
when I'm a hybrid attacker.<br />
I'll take a hit or two, come back,<br />
and watch reality shatter.<br />
You fought. You thought you had a chance to win.<br />
I may be Never Used but never doubt my Defense again.<br />
I'll ring a Heal Bell and tell my team the status is lifted.<br />
Watch out for the comeback! The battle just shifted.</p>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/smog/issue34/pokerap_vaporeon.png" alt=""/></div>

<h3>Vaporeon</h3>

<p>Let me tell you a story peons!<br />
A roarin' Vaporeon<br />
phazed the rebels. She shuffled.<br />
She's not afraid of a scuffle.<br />
You see, she rests with the best<br />
because next turn be impressed.<br />
Hydration cured her while Kyurem<br />
tried hard to ensure her arrest.<br />
Shakin' off all the enemies,<br />
Scaldin' foes and detesting, see<br />
she could care less for bulky types.<br />
She just stalls with her Toxic might!<br />
Massive health is her saving grace.<br />
She's in OU, her rightful place.<br />
She's a goddess. You want a taste?<br />
Say it straight to her godly face!</p>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/smog/issue34/pokerap_jolteon.png" alt=""/></div>

<h3>Jolteon</h3>

<p>Zipping past the opponents,<br />
Zapping ass in the moment,<br />
he's making paths in the zone and<br />
he's breaking bad 'cause he owns it.<br />
He might as well be on Speed<br />
when he's scoutin' moves in the field.<br />
He's sizing up all his threats<br />
but none of his moves ever yield.<br />
When you're thinking you got this<br />
he switches volts on a whim.<br />
You're sweatin' and frettin', wond'rin'<br />
who's next after him?<br />
With GyaraJolt he's BoltBeamin',<br />
hot on his feet and you're steamin'.<br />
With HP Ice he's a demon.<br />
Farewell Garchomp! He's just teasin'.</p>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/smog/issue34/pokerap_flareon.png" alt=""/></div>

<h3>Flareon</h3>

<p>In Gen V they all doubted me,<br />
yet I knew so undoubtedly<br />
I'd come back with a vengeance.<br />
<em>I said I'm back and I meant it!</em><br />
So take a seat and look up.<br />
You look so scared and shook up.<br />
But I think I know the reason, it's<br />
my fantastic Flare Blitz! Shut up<br />
and marvel my magic.<br />
My sweeps are nasty and tragic.<br />
I got Guts and I've had it!<br />
I'm gonna blaze like an addict.<br />
Superpower my powers<br />
and let me Bite you, devour<br />
your checks and counters. I'm lethal,<br />
so screw those ungrateful people!</p>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/smog/issue34/pokerap_sylveon.png" alt=""/></div>

<h3>Sylveon</h3>

<p>Ayooooo, 'mons! It's the ultimate entrance.<br />
Angel from the sky, I'm a true godsend. Since<br />
the early times, Pok&eacute;mon weren't ready for this.<br />
Dragons ruled the land, it wasn't 'til Gen 6<br />
that I made a debut, and epic trainers like you,<br />
yea you and all of your crew, the ones who choose to refuse<br />
that all the Dragons are bomb, so let's show 'em a fuse.<br />
Let's use the Fairy-types to show 'em that they're yesterday's news!<br />
I'm talkin' Moonblast. I'm talkin' bout a Draining Kiss.<br />
I'm talkin' 'bout the Dragon moves that always miss.<br />
They call me Illveon, 'cause frankly all my skills are sick.<br />
It's disgusting how busted my Fairy typing is.<br />
Don't quit on me. I've waited an eternity.<br />
Yeah, I know that y'all have never really heard of me.<br />
I was biding and hiding, letting the dragons reign<br />
so I could come out and devastate the whole metagame!</p>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/smog/issue34/pokerap_eevee.png" alt=""/></div>

<h3>Eevee</h3>

<p>Now that you're well informed<br />
of all eight forms of my scorn,<br />
fear me and all of my power!<br />
A new era is born.<br />
Next time you're standing before me<br />
don't be so quick to claim victory.<br />
Im adaptable, son.<br />
Don't mess with EEVEE&ndash;LU&ndash;TIONS!</p>
