Overview
########

At first glance Shellder seems like just an average Pokémon, with no base stats standing out bar defense. But if you take a closer look Shellder has access to Shell Smash, a boosting move that lowers both defenses while doubling Attack, Special Attack and Speed, in combination with the ability Skill Link turn Shellder into a dangerous sweeping machine. Skill Link is one of the best sweeping abilities, offering two 125 base power moves that break Study, Focus Sash and Substitute. Ice is also one of the greatest attacking types in the game, but Shellder doesnt have the horrible defensive type ice, what makes it even more dangerous.


Shellder's main downside is the fact that after defenses drop, Shellder won't take much of anything. Priority is something Shellder fears, because one hit is usually enough. Thank God Shellder got it's own priority in Ice Shard to kill of weakened priority users or prevent Sucker Punch from hitting. Fast scarfers can outspeed Shellder at +2 and ussually kill it off too.

Shell Smash is the obvious setup move.

Icicle Spear main spammable move, with a base power of 125 and 100% accuracy.

Rock Blast second spammable move, 125 BP but 90% accuracy, should only be used when SE/ice resist.

Set Details
========

Enough speed to reach 26 after Shell Smash, outspeeding most common scarfers.

Eviolite to grant +1 defenses pre-boost and to nullify the defenses drop.


Usage Tips
========

One way to use: Shell Smash Sweep.

Bring in late-game for a late-game sweep or as soon as your opponent is out of priority users.

Only switch in on resisted moves or after something died.

Can safely revenge-kill Dwebble after a boost w/o BJ.



Team Options
========

Knock off users to wear down bulky Pokémon. Mienfoo/Gligar/Pawniard.

Ferroseed is a great partner for Shellder, because it can stealth rock, leech seed and deals with Shellder counters, namely Slowpoke, Magnemite, Aron and Frillish. Also great type synergy.

Team Options
========

Doesn't like entry hazards on the field because it's a hit-and-run Pokémon, so pair with Defog/Rapid Spin user. Vullaby/Gligar/Drilbur.

Other Options
########

Ice Shard outspeeds other priority users and nullifies Sucker Punch on the Shell Smash set.

Rapid Spin is a great utility move Shellder gets, but utility Shellder isn't very viable due to it's poor HP and Special Defense.

Explosion to go out with a bang. Could be used on the Shell Smash set to usually take out one more poke when you know you can't kill.

Surf for people who don't like Hydro Pump misses but do want a special STAB.

Payback to hit ghosts on the switch (Rapid Spin set)
