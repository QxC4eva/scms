[Overview]

<p>For a Pokemon that spends all of its time in a lighthouse, Ampharos is anything but weak. Boasting a base 115 Special Attack stat, along with solid base defenses and HP, Ampharos can deal massive damage with its great coverage moves. Its low Speed is a problem, but its bulk slightly negates this weakness. Aside from access to Volt Switch, which allows it to scout switch-ins, Ampharos also has an annoying ability in Static, which can cripple sweepers that try to end its parade. Overall, Ampharos should not be underestimated, as this cute Pokemon can tear its opponent's world apart.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set utilizes Ampharos's superb coverage, excellent Special Attack stat, and access to Agility to sweep the opposition like no other. Thunderbolt provides Ampharos with a strong STAB move, and Focus Blast lets Ampharos destroy common special walls, such as Ferroseed. Agility boosts Ampharos's Speed to high levels and allows it to outspeed a large part of the metagame. Substitute is the preferred option in the fourth slot, letting Ampharos block status and tank weak attacks. Hidden Power Grass is also an option, allowing Ampharos to defeat threats such as Golurk and Lanturn that would otherwise stop it cold. Finally, Cotton Guard boosts Ampharos's Defense by 3 stages and allows it to easily set up on Pokemon such as Absol.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Timid nature is preferred as it lets Ampharos outrun Timid Choice Scarf Rotom-C, Modest Choice Scarf Rotom, Choice Scarf Medicham, and Accelgor after an Agility. A Modest nature, on the other hand, lets Ampharos hit as hard as possible; this should be used in tandem with an EV spread of 48 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe to let it reach 396 Speed, which outruns Aerodactyl and below. Regardless of which nature Ampharos runs, even after a boost, it will still be outrun by common Choice Scarf users such as Moltres, but Ampharos's solid bulk will let it take at least one hit; its bulk also helps with sponging priority attacks. Leftovers is the preferred item since it lets Ampharos restore its health, but Life Orb lets it hit harder. Static can be useful in certain situations, crippling sweepers that try to take out Ampharos.</p> 

<p>This set appreciates entry hazard support, as it makes Ampharos's job much easier; Pokemon such as Ferroseed are good partners for this. A cleric can be helpful, especially if Ampharos is not running Substitute. A Pokemon with Pursuit, such as Spiritomb, can also be a good partner to take out Golurk; this is even more important if Ampharos is not running Hidden Power Grass.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set uses Ampharos's solid special bulk to wall the special attackers of RU like no other. Its Electric typing and good Special Defense stat mean that it can easily take on the likes of Manectric and Rotom. While it does lack a reliable recovery move, it does have access to Heal Bell to cure status, as well as an excellent Special Attack stat, meaning it can deal a massive amount of damage to the opposition. Thunderbolt is a reliable and powerful STAB move, but Discharge can be used for its higher paralysis chance. Toxic cripples walls that try to take on Ampharos, and Volt Switch allows it to scout and preserve momentum. However, Focus Blast is also an option in the last slot, providing great coverage in tandem with Thunderbolt and allowing Ampharos to destroy otherwise dangerous threats such as Ferroseed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread allows Ampharos to be as specially bulky as possible, and the Calm nature just adds to its bulk. Static is a great ability, allowing Ampharos to have a chance of paralyzing dangerous sweepers that try to finish it off. Leftovers provides Ampharos with a way to restore its HP. Reflect and Light Screen are options to support both Ampharos and its team, but it doesn't have room to run both of them. Wish support is extremely useful, as it will make up for Ampharos's lack of a reliable recovery move, making Pokemon such as Alomomola solid partners. Slow, powerful attackers, such as Druddigon, are also good partners, as Ampharos will be paralyzing things left and right if it is running Discharge. Finally, Hidden Power Grass can be used in the fourth slot to hit Pokemon such as Lanturn and Golurk, but Toxic can usually do the trick anyway.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ampharos's solid bulk and high Special Attack makes it an excellent candidate for a tank set. Volt Switch is the crux of this set, letting Ampharos scout switch-ins and keep the opposition on its toes. Volt Switch becomes even more effective due to the fact that this Ampharos can OHKO most of the metagame with the right move. Focus Blast lets Ampharos nail Steel-types, most notably Ferroseed and Probopass. Hidden Power Grass allows Ampharos to defeat Lanturn, who otherwise wall this set entirely. Hidden Power Ice is also an option, however, to provide Ampharos with more neutral coverage, and to let it decimate Tangrowth in exchange for a much weaker hit on the likes of Rhydon and Lanturn. Finally, Thunderbolt is a solid STAB move that, unlike Volt Switch, doesn't force Ampharos to switch out.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Specs is the preferred item, letting Ampharos hit as hard as possible and decimate the metagame. However, Life Orb is also an option, trading some of the power from Choice Specs for the ability to switch moves. A Modest nature and 252 Special Attack EVs allow Ampharos to hit as hard as possible. 48 Speed EVs let Ampharos outrun 4 Speed Clefable and decimate it with Focus Blast before it can cripple Ampharos; 208 HP EVs give Ampharos some extra bulk.</p>

<p>Prediction is key with this set, especially if Ampharos is holding Choice Specs, as Ground-types such as Rhydon can block Volt Switch and leave Ampharos a sitting duck. This set appreciates entry hazard support, as it will force multiple switches. Rapid Spin support is also helpful, because with Volt Switch, Ampharos will be switching in a lot. Almost all sweepers are good teammates, as this Ampharos can easily weaken the opposition, especially with entry hazard support. Other Electric-types, such as Galvantula, can also be good partners, as they can destroy common switch-ins, such as Rotom-C, who can absorb Volt Switch, through the use of their own Grass- (or in Galvantula's case, Bug-) type moves.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>Sadly, Ampharos doesn't have too many other options. A SubPunch set can be used, but Pokemon such as Rhydon will still beat it easily due to Ampharos's low Attack stat; opposing Electric-types will also destroy it. Focus Blast hits harder than Focus Punch on almost the entire metagame anyway. Signal Beam is another option, but the coverage provided by Hidden Power Grass and Focus Blast makes them much more useful in general.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Golurk can wall all variants of Ampharos that lack Hidden Power Grass or Toxic; Lanturn is in the same boat, although if it runs Heal Bell, it must only watch out for Hidden Power Grass. Entry hazards can be a major problem for Ampharos, especially since it has no way to restore its health; this means that repeated attacks can finish it off as well. The Agility set can still be outsped by almost all Choice Scarf users, so Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Primeape can easily finish it off; physical attackers have to be wary of Static, however. Finally, Golurk can easily finish off Ampharos with an Earthquake, but must be wary of Hidden Power Grass.</p>
