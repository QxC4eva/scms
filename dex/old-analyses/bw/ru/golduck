[Overview]

<p>Golduck is one of the many Pokemon that has never made it to OU. It faces huge competition from other Water-types in RU and is generally outclassed. This duck is much overlooked and classified as having no competitive value, mostly due to its mediocre stats. However, Golduck has two great abilities which give it a small niche in RU. Cloud Nine and Swift Swim allow Golduck to find a spot on weather teams, namely rain and hail. With Cloud Nine, Golduck takes no damage from hail; while Swift Swim gives it an oppurtunity to sweep in rain. Golduck is also the second fastest Swift Swim user in RUâ€”the first being Floatzel. While often outclassed by Simipour, which has Nasty Plot, Golduck sets itself apart with its great support moves, such as Encore. Encore and Cloud Nine allow Golduck to counter StallRein, something not many other Pokemon can claim to. Being a Water-type, Golduck has only two weaknesses, which makes it easier for it to set up. With a decent base 95 Special Attack, access to Calm Mind, and its wide offensive coverage, Golduck can make a potent sweeper. Although Golduck isn't close to the definition of powerful, it has some hidden potential thanks to its two abilities. If you can't find something to fit into your hail or rain team in RU, look no further; Golduck is probably what you're searching for.</p>

<p>Why use Calm Mind Golduck when you can use Nasty Plot Simipour? The answer is that Golduck has Cloud Nine, making it a great fit on hail teams. Simipour, on the other hand, would likely fall to residual damage from both Life Orb recoil and hail. Calm Mind is Golduck's only method of setting up, capable of boosting Golduck's base 95 Special Attack to great heights. After a Calm Mind, Golduck can 2HKO a huge portion of RU thanks to its wide coverage. Hydro Pump is Golduck's strongest STAB move, and is bound to hurt anything that doesn't resist it. Ice Beam allows Golduck to hit Grass-types super effectively, whilst Hidden Power Grass destroys opposing Water-types, such as Quagsire and Slowking. However, Encore eases set up if you're not duly worried by Water-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Cloud Nine allows Golduck to aid hail teams in checking other weather inducers, whilst crushing Swift Swim users, such as Omastar. As Snover is the only hail inducer in RU, Golduck is a great asset to hail teams; Golduck can easily come in on Fire-type attacks aimed at Snover, and start setting up with Calm Mind. Surf can be used over Hydro Pump for perfect accuracy, but the drop in power is very noticable, especially after a Calm Mind. Psyshock is an option to use against special walls, such as Clefable, but it reduces Golduck's coverage no matter what move it replaces. Grass-types, including Snover, are good teammates, as they resist the two types Golduck is weak to. If Golduck does not have Hidden Power Grass, it risks being walled by opposing Water-types. As such, Grass-type teammates are all the more important to Golduck. Bouffalant, although not a Grass-type, is a viable teammate thanks to Sap Sipper. As special walls can stop Golduck with ease, Bouffalant and other strong physical attackers make for great teammates, as they excel at removing these walls.</p>

<p>Golduck is blessed with wide coverage, and this set aims to make to best out of it. With the listed moves, Golduck can hit every Pokemon for at least neutral damage, making it hard to find an appropriate switch-in to the kappa. Though this Golduck might fail miserably at sweeping, it can drown the opponent's team with proper prediction. Ice Beam and Hidden Power Grass are mandatory alongside Hydro Pump, in order to give Golduck the widest coverage possible. The last move is dependent on your preference, and what you want Golduck to hit. With Focus Blast, Golduck can hit a common special walls in RU, Clefable, super effectively. Psyshock has better accuracy, and hits Pokemon such as Ludicolo harder than any of Golduck's other moves. Cloud Nine allows Golduck to check some common rain abusers, such as Kabutops and Omastar. As Cloud Nine disables Swift Swim, Golduck can outspeed most of these rain abusers and launch a Hidden Power Grass to KO them. However, do note that Swift Swim Golduck can still outspeed Kabutops and Omastar and do the same; but Cloud Nine removes the rain boost to Water-type attacks, which allows Golduck to come on those moves with more ease. With Choice Specs, Golduck can deal out huge damage, and wipe out a huge chunk of HP from a special wall, paving the way for another special sweeper to come in later and finish the job. Life Orb will allow Golduck to retain its ability to switch moves, and prevent Golduck from becoming setup fodder.<p/>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Although Golduck has higher Special Attack than Attack, Cross Chop can be used over Focus Blast. Not only does Cross Chop have better accuracy, it also allows Golduck to hit some special walls, such as Clefable much harder. Entry hazard support is helpful to weaken special walls (except Clefable), giving Golduck an easier time dealing with them. Ferroseed is a good teammate, as it resists both of Golduck's weakness. Wish support is helpful, as Golduck has no method of recovery. The greater longevity provided by Wish will allow Golduck to wreak more havoc and check more threats. Clefable can pass huge Wishes to Golduck, and can take most Grass- and Electric-type attacks aimed at the latter easily. Grass-types, such as Snover, are great teammates, as they have good typing synergy. The choice of ability is dependent on what type of team Golduck is in. If Golduck is on a hail team, Cloud Nine is preferred, while if on a rain team, Swift Swim is the way to go. Surf can be used over Hydro Pump, but the latter is the better option when Golduck holds Choice Specs and is on a rain team, as the power loss from using Surf is very noticeable. A physical attacker is a good teammate as well, as Golduck has the tendency to attract special walls. Electivire is one example, as it can switch in on Electric-type attacks aimed at Golduck and receive a Speed boost from Motor Drive.</p>

<p>Golduck already has perfect coverage between three moves, and can spare one moveslot to accomodate a support move. This set allows Golduck to support rain teams, summoning the rain itself with Rain Dance. Not only can Golduck set up rain, it can also attempt a sweep once it has acomplished its role. With Swift Swim, few Pokemon can outspeed Golduck under the rain. Factoring in STAB, rain boost, and Life Orb, Hydro Pump comes to a massive 351 Base Power, which makes it even stronger than a 2x super effective Ice Beam. Either Life Orb or Damp Rock can be used; the choice of item depends on how reliant the team is on Golduck to set up the rain. If your team does not have enough Rain Dance users, Damp Rock is the preferred item to provide longer rain, though the power loss without Life Orb can be off-putting. Though this set's primary aim is to set up rain, it also allows Golduck to sweep with its wide coverage. Ice Beam freezes Ice- and Flying-types, while Hidden Power Grass handles opposing Water-types, which would otherwise wall Golduck completely.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Psyshock can be used to bypass special walls, and Focus Blast is an option to hit Clefable and Ferroseed super effectively. However, changing either of Golduck's moves will hamper its wide coverage. Although Surf might seem like a more reliable option over Hydro Pump, the power difference between those two moves, especially when under rain, is huge. The much higher power that Hydro Pump provides somewhat offsets the accuracy issue. Other rain abusers, such as Omastar, are great teammates to fully utilize the rain Golduck sets up. Omastar, in particular, can work in tandem with Golduck to pressurize and weaken special walls. Their rain-boosted Hydro Pumps will severely dent any special wall not named Slowking. A physically oriented teammate, such as Kabutops, is also viable, being able to handle the special walls that trouble Golduck. Primeape is another good option to smash through Clefable, as well as checking Lilligant, which takes a pittance from Golduck's Ice Beam.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Golduck has a decent movepool, filled with many competitively viable moves; Cross Chop allows Golduck to slice through Clefable, and has better accuracy than Focus Blast. Golduck also has a few nifty support options, such as Yawn, Confuse Ray, Disable, Hynosis, and Refresh. Yawn and Hypnosis can put an opponent to sleep. Yawn in particular can be used as a phazing move, as it puts your opponent in a disadvantageous position. BW gave Disable an accuracy boost, making Disable a viable option to cripple a target. Golduck even has Encore, which can be used to lock the opponent into a move before Disabling it. Refresh is an option, as it allows Golduck to act as a pseudo-status absorber. Not only can Golduck use Rain Dance, it also has access to Hail. Hail allows Golduck to summon the weather and relieves Snover the duty of having to switch in everytime to change the weather back. Damp is an interesting ability to consider if your team does not have a Ghost-type to take the rare Explosion; however, Cloud Nine and Swift Swim have better utility. Golduck can use Choice Scarf to act as a revenge killer by abusing its wide coverage, but its unboosted attacks will not be smashing through anything.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Lilligant takes next to nothing from Golduck's attacks, even Ice Beam, and can set up with Quiver Dance. Rotom-A can revenge kill Golduck, or force it out and use Volt Switch. Special walls such as Clefable will easily put a stop to Golduck and end its sweep. Ludicolo can not only abuse the rain, but it can also wipe Golduck out with a Grass-type attack. Faster Grass-types, such as Sceptile, can revenge kill Golduck, but they have to be wary of switching into an Ice Beam. Opposing Water-types, such as Slowking, can easily wall Golduck if it does not have Hidden Power Grass, but Golduck rarely lacks this move. Ferroseed can easily set up entry hazards if Golduck does not have Focus Blast. Electric-types, such as Manetric and Electivire can outspeed Golduck if rain is not present, and fry it with their STAB moves, turning Golduck into roasted duck.</p>
