<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello.</p>

<p>So, I'm here to present my third RMT. This is a pure ladder team, a somewhat brainless & weatherless HO. A bit of history, I started playing this team during the Deoxys-D suspect. And guess what, I peaked #1 quite fast (and then I played random stuff for fun because I could lose as much as I want, suspect voters know what I'm talking about). Oh, I also hit #1 on the classic PS! ladder after the suspect, undefeated.<br/ >
So, the version of that team that I post here is the old one that I used for both peak, I'm now using some kind of rework of this team. So go ahead, play it, steal it or post a RMT with two slight changes and get my luvdiscs x 4. I won't even get mad.<br/ >
I already published this team some time ago on the french forum, so you can check it out if you understand our sweet language.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/450.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Garchomp</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Rough Skin<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Outrage</p>

<p>Yes, you can play Fire Blast over Sword Dance. No, you don't need to post a rate to point out that change.<Br/ >
So Garchomp lead is something really useful, you get SR up no matter what and usually you can punch a hole in the enemy's team. Depending on the team you're facing, you'll need sometimes to save this guy ! For instance against a Volcarona, you better have a healthy Garchomp ready.<br/ >
Basically, there will be good players able to know when to start with him and when to not, and there will be less good players starting with him all day. The first pokemon you send, and the "lead" match-up is REALLY important for a HO team. You need to outplay your opponent, one thing I wanted to do, is make the lead Garchomp obvious (no other SR setter here), so I could easily play around what could be sent by my opponent.<Br/ >
Yes, you can play Terrakion here, but you'll need to change one or two other things.</p>

<p><strong>Landorus</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Sheer Force<br />
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>"Oh my god, he plays U-Turn Landorus, no one falls for it".<br/ >
MAYBE, but when I was playing it, it was fairly uncommon, I was still a hipster.<br/ >
All those Landorus discussions made this set pretty known, and thus, not so original and surprising anymore. Landorus works wonders with Keldeo (no fuck really ?) and along with Weavile, there are only few things able to stand in Keldeo's way.<br/ >
What I love about the U-Turn version, is that if you're able to predict decently your opponent, you'll be rewarded. In a HO, it's a risky game, and many people will prefer the RP version to build a "chain of sweepers" team. That's not my plan. I wanted my team to be dynamic, Landorus fuels my team with energy thanks to his pivoting. You'll also notice that each of my pokemons has a "defensive task" and shares a particular synergy with the rest of the team. This is what, in my opinion, makes a HO interesting and versatile (and not just a fucking chain of sweepers).</p>

<p><strong>Weavile</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 32 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD / 216 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Ice Shard<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Low Kick<br />
- Night Slash</p>

<p>In theory, Landorus U-Turn + Weavile = Keldeo Sweep.<br/ >
This pokemon is my favorite, but I'm really not trying to put him in every single team ! I used Tyranitar in here for a fairly long time too (no need to post a rate about it, thank you).<br/ >
Funny to see that when I posted a team with Weavile some time ago, every single rater tried to make me change this pokemon. While when Weavile is used in other people's team, they are like "oh my god, so creative, so original, I never thought of Weavile, this is crazy" blablabla.<br/ >
Ice Shard is also what makes Weavile unic. No Landorus's (or Thundrus-T) sweep... but also, no Starmie, no Alakazam, no Lati@s etc. Weavile is cool, he's a Dark typed pokemon, he fills my opponent's brain with fear because he knows that if he switch in his Psychic Pokemon, this will be his last time.</p>

<p><strong>Breloom</strong> @ Fighting Gem<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 112 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 140 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Spore<br />
- Bullet Seed<br />
- Mach Punch<br />
- Focus Punch</p>

<p>What a noob, Focus Punch Breloom !<br/ >
I've been terrifying the ladder with that Breloom. I don't know how many people switched in their Jirachi thinking "this fool gonna Bullet Seed" and then left after the OHKO.<br/ >
This set was so "gimmick" when I started playing it, but it wall breaks SO HARD to be honest. Skarmory gets killed with that, SpD Celebi too. There is no other wall breaker for my team than this guy. He does his job so well. I don't know what to say, Breloom is a crucial part of the puzzle and I love using this set as a cheap wall breaker.</p>

<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Iron Plate<br />
Ability: Techinician<br />
EVs: 200 HP / 252 Atk / 56 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Roost</p>

<p>The fakeZor, it gives so much substance to my team, so much defensive presence, without giving up the offensive momemtum. Who else could do that while tanking Dragons ?<br/ >
Occasionally, he sweeps. Especially when the guy against you is like "I'm sure he's choiced, I'll just let my Ferrothorn in and put some hazards" while you SD. And when he tries to worn you down with Leech Seed/Gyro Ball as you Roost Stall him before your +6Atk sweep... So good. He plays different roles, depending on the match-up, on the plays etc. He's versatile, he provides me with bulk, a win condition, and momemtum... Don't touch my Scizor.</p>

<p><strong>Keldeo</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Justified<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Surf<br />
- Hidden Power Ice<br />
- Secret Sword</p>

<p>Okay, so this team is supposed to be built around a Keldeo's sweep. In theory, nothing can wall this pokemon in the late game given the other sweepers assisting the pony.<br/ >
I don't have much to say here, this guy works really well against the most classic weather teams archetype, Rain and Sand offense. The few pokemons able to outspeed this guys should be checked by the rest of my team. His typing is ideal, I need a water pokemon, and the Fighting type helps against Scizor as well.<br/ >
Oh well, screw it, I have nothing to add to this description.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, this is a team made for the ladder, but I'm also proud of the overall balance of this team. As you can see, this team looks like my last RMT in the way it has been built, and considering the pokemons that I use. I made a "fast" threat list etc. because I'm too lazy, and because I've already done it in french so I guess I don't need to redo all the work, I can rather just jump to the conclusions I've made when I built the original threat list.<br/ >
This team looks braindead, it looks like a "send your sweeper and attack" team, but don't get fooled or you'll never be able to adapt to every situation and make the team work. Every single pokemon has a specific role defensively and offensively speaking, if you disregard that, you'll end up losing many easy games, like "Oh fuck, I shouldn't have let my Garchomp die, this Infernape is raping me irate:"... this kind of stuff.</p>
