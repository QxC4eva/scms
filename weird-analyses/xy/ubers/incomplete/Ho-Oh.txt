Overview
########

Ho-Oh is a massive force in the Ubers tier. Boasting a good 130 base Attack coupled with two extremely potent and strong STAB moves in Sacred Fire and Brave Bird, as well as a massive 154 base Special Defense alongside the wonderful ability Regenerator, which restores a third of its HP when it switches out, and reliable recovery in Roost, Ho-Oh is a resilient bulky attacker capable of 2HKOing the majority of Pokemon in the tier. While Fire- and Flying-typing complement each other very well offensively for excellent neutral coverage in the tier, it also brings it a glaring 4x weakness to Rock-type moves, causing Ho-Oh to lose half of its health if it switches in while Stealth Rock is up on its side of the field. This weakness may not be as bad as it appears, as XY introduced a reliable means of removing Stealth Rock with the move Defog, which is generally more reliable than Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce ever was. Even with this buff, Ho-Oh's 4x weakness to Rock-type moves is still exploitable, as most Rock-type moves thrown around in the tier will fell it in one or two hits.

Moves
========

Brave Bird is really strong STAB move that hits practically 2HKOs whatever that doesn't resist it, including max HP Arceus Formes. Another notable aspect of the move is that it 2HKOs any Kyogre variant with Life Orb boosting its power. Speaking of Life Orb, the recoil adding up together with Brave Birds side-effect can be quite upsetting at times, but don't forget that in conjunction with your recovery move of choice and Regenerator the lost HP can be gained back quite reliably. Your secondary STAB, Sacred Fire is extremely potent. Even if a Pokemon resisting it switches in on this move, you have a 50 % chance to leave it with a burn, assuming you hit. Few switch ins enjoy the residual damage from burns, Arceus formes like Water and Rock are a prime example of this. The burn rate really discourages just about all physical attackers to switch into Ho-oh since burns will render them useless for the course of the game. Zekrom, who resists both Ho-oh's STAB moves is a good example of this. Under harsh sunlight, Sacred Fire is also boosted by 50 %, making it Ho-oh's strongest attack- to the point where the chance of 2HKOing even the most defensive variants of Groudon is quite prevalent. It cannot be understated that Sacred Fire's power in combination with its side effect is what makes Ho-oh such a difficult Pokemon to directly switch into.

A recovery move is mandatory. When you give a Pokemon Regenerator, 154 special defense and 130 attack with two almost unresisted STABs you are pushing it. Giving it Roost is almost taking the term bulky attacker too far, with it your longevity easily outmatches just about everything in the game- when Stealth Rock are off the field. The choice between Roost and Recover is a preference issue. Roost will help you against some would be super effective hits, especially with paralysis support, while Recover is nice vs Earthquake users trying to predict your landing. However, with Recover, Pokemon like a burned Groudon can easily get back to smashing you with Stone Edge after you revealed the move so beware.

Substitute eases prediction and it's rather easy to recover that lost health anyway. In conjunction with a Toxic lure for Ho-oh's biggest counter, Arceus-Rock, this move puts a lot of pressure on said counter, by repeatedly using Substitute as it switches in to rack up Toxic damage. Since your attacks are very powerful, a free Substitute can sometimes mean that your opponent will almost have to sacrifice a Pokemon such as Kyogre just to break your Rhydon-doll. One of the biggest assets of Substitute is what could come with potential paralysis support. Against some threats like Xerneas and Palkia (in sun) that you managed to paralyse, you will be able to spam Substitute and Roost until they get fully paralyzed, giving you a free Substitute. If Substitute isn't your thing, Earthquake is very viable and hits Tyranitar, Zekrom, Arceus-Rock and Heatran very hard, 2HKOing all three former, and OHKOs the latter. Aside from the potential free Substitutes you can use to cushion potential revenge killers or put pressure on switch ins, giving up on Substitute means you will have a tougher time protecting yourself from status as well.

Ho-oh also has two options that can go in the last move slot to attempt to patch up its mediocre speed. The first one, Flame Charge, has the advantage of dealing damage at the same time as boosting, and the speed boost given is permanent until Ho-oh switches out. Option two, Tailwind, doubles Ho-oh's speed as well as doubling any team mate's speed as well. However, Tailwind only lasts for three turns, so the boost is quite inconsistent. The opportunity cost for losing Substitute or Earthquake is also quite big, but if your team needs the specific advantages these two moves bring, then by all means use them. Also, remember to invest in speed accordingly- Flame Charge sets generally needs max speed investment to outspeed Mega Mewtwo Y after one boost, while Tailwind like having 176 EVs to outspeed Choice-Scarf Terrakion when Tailwind is in play.

Set Details
========

This set appreciates the high damage output that comes with Life Orb, but Leftovers are still usable if you want to increase your tanking ability and take less recoil. The power loss is quite big, defensive Kyogre are now 3HKOd and defensive Giratina is only 4HKOd for example.

An Adamant nature with maximum investment in Attack is rather self-explainatory for bulky attacker like this, and it usually is the best option to maximize your damage output. However, settling for a specialized number catered to a specific team's needs is of course viable as well. 252 HP EVs gives you great bulk, allowing you to cushion most neutral special attacks comfortably.

Usage Tips
========

For optimal performance, Ho-oh will need Stealth Rock off its own side of this field to reliably switch in, as well as abusing Regenerator to the max. It is therefore important to play your Defog user or Rapid Spinner in such a way so that it outlasts the opponents Stealth Rock setter. Keep in mind that the most common Defog users, Arceus-Formes are vulnerable to Toxic, so keep them away from Stealth Rock users that carry the move at all time possible. When you see the chance of getting Ho-oh in to do some damage, take that chance. Dishing out hits and regenerating your health puts a lot of pressure on opponents, especially if they don't carry a dedicated check to it.

As Ho-oh has a very exploitable weakness it is important to scout for surprise Rock-moves properly. Mixed Xerneas can use Rock Slide, Giratina-O can possibly have Stone Edge and Aegislash can have Head Smash in its arsenal. Even the possibility some Arceus formes carry Stone Edge it just to ruin your day exists. Understanding how metagame defining Ho-oh is and accepting that players can prepare and use moves just for it should always be accounted for. As Ho-oh is brutally weak to Stealth Rock, another thing to keep in mind is to get rid off it from the field, which requires a teammate's support.

Do not make the mistake of using this as you only way to stop a boosted Xerneas. It's hard to rely on Defog at all times, and Ho-oh can't OHKO Xerneas either. In general, use Ho-oh as the powerful wallbreaker it is, but don't rely on it as a check to too much stuff. Try to build your team in a way so that you can use Ho-oh's qualities to the maximum potential, but at the same time in a way so that it won't be overly reliant on Ho-oh to perform.

Team Options
========

Defog support is on the brink of mandatory when using Ho-oh. Rapid Spin works too but the spinners themselves are underpowered in terms of Uber standards and old strategizes like Spikes-stacking with your spinner to double up roles isn't as spikes setter are harder too pull off since Defog can simply remove those hazards very easily. However, spinning can still work with some smart teambuilding. The most reliable Defog users are Arceus-Formes due to their high speed, bulk and access to Recover. Arceus Water has pretty good synergy with Ho-oh, taking on Kyogre, Groudon and Arceus Rock quite well. Arceus Grass floats in the same boat, but is weaker to the omnipresent Gengar and has a hard time fitting in Stone Edge on its Defog set, meaning you'll give opposing Ho-oh a lot of free turns. Since Arceus Grass is generally very weak to Ho-oh, this can limit your teambuilding options a lot. Arceus-Fariy is another notable Defog user- just like most Arceus formes it can cripple Stealth Rock users that also happen to check Ho-oh, such a Landorous-T and Groudon. Some lesser used Defogers are viable as well. Lugia can act like an extra wall and check to a lot of things, while Scizor helps out tremendously when it comes to making your team solid against Geomancy Xerneas.

Groudon is another terrific teammate. It takes on Zekrom pretty well, and it sets up Stealth Rocks for your team, something Ho-oh appreciates as it heaps up the pressure on anything the opposing team would want to switch into it. Groudon's ability Drought also provides Sun support, and despite only lasting five turns, it is still sufficient, considering Ho-oh has an easy time coming in a against some things that threaten Groudon in the sun like Palkia, Arceus-Grass and Kyurem-White. In a similar vein to why Groudon is a good partner, Landorous-T is too. The distinction between the both are that while Groudon can phaze, use Thunder Wave or Fire-moves, Landorous-T has the ability to check Mega-Blaziken as well as checking other Groudon better.

Palkia deserves a mention as a good teammates as well. It has great synergy with Ho-oh, as it checks all Kyogre variants and the combined force of the two threats pressures defensive teams. Lastly, Ho-oh fits quite well together with Kyogre, Ho-oh can help by checking out Arceus-Grass that walls it, and Kyogre can pressure out Arceus-Rock for Ho-oh.

Any Pokemon with Thunder Wave support is a good partner for Ho-oh as it can possibly get free Substitutes or outspeed things it normally wouldn't. Groudon, Lugia, Kyogre, Klefki, Thundurus and Dialga are some examples of Thunder Wave users in the tier, but a lot of Ubers such as Palkia can surprisingly learn the move so cater your support to your team's needs.

Physically defensive
########
name: Physically defensive
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Sacred Fire
move 3: Roost / Recover
move 4: Toxic / Whirlwind
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
nature: Impish
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 Spd

Moves
========

Brave Bird is mandatory on this set as well. It hits decently hard without investment and having such attacking power for a defensively inclined Pokémon differentiates it from Giratina and Lugia. Sacred Fire is especially useful on this set for its side-effect. Spreading burns on physical attackers makes them easier to wall, and the residual damage can helps stalling out many threats that cannot recover health. A recovery move is obviously a must for a defensive set. Roost is better than Recover here since outstalling a slower Groudon is much easier with this set, a predicted Earthquake from a burnt Groudon on a your faster Roost will not deal too much damage. Finally, the last slot is dedicated to either Toxic, which can cripple many common switch ins like Arceus Rock and Water, while Whirlwind phazes out set up sweepers like Extremekiller Arceus and Geomancy Xerneas.

Set Details
========

Maximum Defense EVs and an Impish nature makes Ho-oh surprisingly durable one the physical side, allowing it to take on threats such like Extremekiller Arceus, Mewtwo, Foul Play Yveltal, and Stone Edge-less Lucario well well when Stealth Rock are not up. With maximum HP investment, Ho-oh tanks special attacks just fine thanks to its naturally high Special Defense stat, however, if you wish to abuse its gargantuan special bulk to the maximum, investing all Defense EVs in Special Defense instead can be feasible if it fits your team's needs.

Usage Tips
========

Again, keep Stealth Rock off your side of the field to make this Pokémon function optimally. Don't be afraid to do more "reckless" switch ins to support Arceus formes that you should be able to wall with this set. While the above set takes 80-94 % from a -atk Arceus's Stone Edge, but this variant of Ho-oh fares way better so you can mostly just switch out to Regenerate a good portion of the damage anyway. Since this set has a much higher Defense stat than the above one the need of always scouting is somewhat lesser, as demonstrated above.

Do not that even with the big Defense investment, Ho-oh still has trouble taking on some common physical attackers, regardless of Stealth Rock being on your field or not. Zekrom, Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X (which often carries a Rock-move) are examples of physical attackers that busts through your invested defenses quite easily. As the mixed defensive tank Ho-oh becomes with the given spread, it should also be played to the advantage that it can check threats from both sides of the spectrum. Extremekiller Arceus, Blaziken and sometimes even other Ho-oh are physical attackers that this Ho-oh can switch into.

Even though this set has a lot defensive investment, it's Special Defense is still higher so take on special attackers if you see it fit. Especially with Whirlwind, Ho-oh functions as a great Xerneas counter, should Stealth Rock not be up. It is also notable in that is can take on Mega Mewtwo Y very well under the right circumstances as Psystrike is not a OHKO.

Team Options
========

As explained previously, Defog support is a must when using Ho-oh, and this set is no exception. Arceus formes such as Fairy, Water, Rock, Grass and Ghost can provide more or less some synergy with Ho-oh aside from helping it with hazard removal. Giratina-O is not recommended as a a Defog user to pair with this Ho-oh because of the set's more defensively inclined nature, meaning Giratina-O who has no recovery is likely to be outlasted by the opposing Stealth Rock user. Mega-Scizor can work as a Defog user to pair with this Ho-oh. Although it's quite slow and therefore more prone to Taunt, the metal bug handily checks Groudon and semi checks Zekrom for Ho-oh, while Ho-oh checks opposing Ho-oh in return.

It's always wise to pair Ho-oh with a Ground type to milder the threat that is Zekrom. Landorous-T and Groudon spring to mind as they both provide Stealth Rock support. A Swords Dance Ground-Arceus appreciates Ho-oh's ability to absorb burns from the likes of Giratina, but keep in mind that there is a big opportunity cost not using a Defog Arceus with Ho-oh.

Of course Ho-oh needs to be paired with something that can handle Kyogre. That something is usually Palkia, but if you want to hit two birds in one stone then Arceus Water is viable as both a Water move deterrent and a Defoger. Arceus Grass is similar, except it trades a strong STAB to hit Kyogre and Groudon with for a tendency to get removed from the game by Mega Gengar. Both these Arceus formes check Arceus-Rock extremely good as well.

Kyogre is once again a solid option to pressure Arceus-Rock. Choice Scarf, Choice Specs or specially defensive variants all fit well with Ho-oh. Keep in mind that your team will have two Electric weaknesses stacked so a Ground-type is mandatory at this stage.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Sacred Fire
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Regenerator
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spd

Moves
========

Hit hard as hell with Brave Bird. This move will is now guaranteed to always OHKO Palkia, 0 HP Kyogre among other threats. When equipping a Choice Band instead Life Orb your Brave Bird is stronger and the recoil damage is lesser. With the Defog buff and Regenerator this set is pretty much the pinnacle of hit and run tactics. If you thought Brave Bird was strong, a sun-boosted Sacred Fire is absolutely ridiculous, being able to OHKO 4 HP Arceus Formes with only Stealth Rock support. It also OHKOs max HP Arceus with the help of a burn! Even the most defensive Groudon variants are guaranteed to fall in two hits, regardless of you landing the burn on it.

Earthquake is solid and powerful coverage move and hits Ho-oh's best checks and counters very hard. Arceus-Rock will find itself in a very sticky spot if it switches in on an Earthquake when burned from a previous assault since Earthquake can max out on about 81 % damage. Lastly, Sleep Talk is a good move to have against Darkrai. Your attacks are very powerful and with few drawbacks, meaning the random pick factor isn't as bad as it seems.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment is self-explanatory, along with the Choice Band and high powered STAB moves it pumps up Ho-oh attacking power to extreme levels. With 252 EVs invested in HP, Ho-oh's ability to tank hits is retained quite well, although the lack off Roost off course hurts that aspect of the phoenix.

There are two alternative spreads this set could use. First off is a a faster spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spd, Jolly nature is viable to ensure maximum chances of outspeeding Pokémon like netural natured specs Kyogre, Yveltal and Xerneas for example. The other alternative spread is 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 Spd with an Adamant nature. It retains a lot of the qualities Physcially Defensive Ho-oh has, trading off Roost for higher attacking power.

Usage Tips
========

It cannot be understated how important it is to play the entry hazards game well when using Ho-oh. This applies even more so for this set, which likes having Stealth Rock up on the opponent's side of the field to still be able to punish possible misprediction as well as having Stealth Rock off its side of the field for obvious reason. Another big reason that it is absolutely detrimental to keep them off is to that this set doesn't have a Recovery move and must rely on Regenerator to gain damage back. Therefore it is equally important for this set to utilize Regenerator to gain maximum recovery- pivot switching in on resisted hits and such is a big part of how to play a Choice Banded Ho-oh.

The second part on this sets usage is the key of prediction. Even though Ho-oh's attacks are strong and unresisted together it is good to have a plan on what to do when initiating combat. There are a few roads you can go here, the first being throwing out Sacred Fires all over the place to spread burns. After your switch ins are burnt, Ho-oh can now pressure them harder with its coverage. However, if one wants to take advantage of an obvious Kyogre switching in to sponge a Sacred Fire, then by all means do it. If you suspect Arceus-Rock being your opponents Arceus forme, then go ahead and throw out an Earthquake early in situation when it's safe to do so.

Team Options
========

Defog support again please, just always use it with Ho-oh. Aside from the common support Arceus Formes, Defog Giratina-O can work on a team with a Choice Band Ho-oh, usually since you are aiming to smash up your opponent faster than with usual sets- which makes Giratina-O's inability to Defog consistently throughout a game is less of a problem Thunder Wave support from Groudon, Lugia, Kyogre are just some examples of Thunder Wave users in the tier. Being faster than the opponent gives Ho-oh more time to dish out hits without worrying about possible Brave Bird recoil bringing it down.

Groudon support is nice as usual. Most other Ground types are also nice, Landorous-T functions similarly to Groudon. Again, Swords Dance Groundceus can be a good partner if you have a Defog user that is not an Arceus forme. Since Ho-oh pressures Giratina, Bronzong and Landorous-T, common counter to Arceus Ground, it will get better opportunities to sweep. Palkia, Arceus-Water, Arceus-Grass or anything else you can find for checking Kyogre is mandatory as well, luckily Kyogre checks tend to synergize well with Ho-oh.

Other Options
========

Ho-oh is some other options to use. Choice Scarf is an interesting one, it allows Ho-oh to revenge kill most notably Mega Mewtwo X among other threats. Generally, the power and bulk loss with this item is discouraged. Thunder Wave is as explained an excellent form of support for Ho-oh, but Ho-oh itself using it leaves it with a mit of a four moveslots syndrome, it won't be able to abuse Substitute together with Thunder Wave without having to give up on coverage or recovery. However if forgoing Substitute, Ho-oh can always throw out paralysis on fast switch ins such a Kyogre and Arceus formes, not making it useless option. Punishment can be used to punish (fucking triple pun GP remove this) Calm Mind Arceus Ghost, but Sacred Fire usually hits hard enough and Calm Mind Arceus Ghost being much rarer than it used to be makes this option useless.


Checks & Counters
########
Ho-oh incredibly difficult to counter. It must be treaded around with maximum caution if it gets in safely. Except even teams that have listed checks and counter below to actually fall to it. The main reason is that Ho-oh can always go for Earthquake along with its STAB moves to retain perfect coverage. The other reason is Ho-oh's inability to be worn down without Stealth Rock being up on its side of the field. Teams have the options of either having solid switch ins (that can still fall) or having a sufficient plan at pressuring Ho-oh with both Stealth Rock and offensive pressure.


Stealth Rock

The number one counter is not a Pokemon, it is this entry hazard. The rocks strip 50 % of Ho-oh's health every time it switches in, limiting its ability's power as well as the tanking power of the phoenix itself. Since every team should have Stealth Rock, this analysis won't go in depth about which one to use. The important thing is how you play your Stealth Rock user. It is of absolute grave importance to wear Ho-oh's Defog supporter down and try to keep your Stealth Rock user alive if you want to keep rocks up against Ho-oh. Usually something as simple as Toxic on your Stealth Rock user can go a long way considering it cripples Defog Arceus really badly. What is also important to realize is that all checks to Ho-oh function somewhat differently, and therefore they cannot be lumped together in sections as with other Pokémon.

**Arceus Rock**: This is the single Pokémon that has the best chances of switching in and forcing Ho-oh out safely. It resists Ho-oh' dual STAB but is weak to Earthquake. It is thankfully faster and can OHKO with a Judgment.

**Arceus Water**: Even though a 252 HP variant takes above 50 % from a Life Orb boosted Brave Bird, it can still switch into Sacred Fire and Earthquake and do about 50 % to Ho-oh in return with a super effective Judgment. However, it will have a touch time switching into a Ho-oh in sun. A physically defensive variant of this Pokémon can perform the task a bit better, though.

**Hippowdown**: Hippowdown isn't 2HKOd by any Life Orb boosted hit, but Choice Band rips it apart with two consectutive Brave Birds. The hippo has reliable recovery and Stealth Rock to boot, so it qualifies as a good sponge for Ho-oh's attacks, but it can't really hurt it back directly.

**Kyogre**: By far the most practical way of handling Ho-oh is offensive pressure. Kyogre is often faster than Ho-oh due to investing in speed and can therefore force it out and dish out impressive damage on its counters as well. As for switching in, even the most defensive variants of Kyogre are 2HKOd by a simple Life Orb Brave Bird, while offensive sets have a chance of getting OHKOd. Switching in on Sacred Fire is usually fine for obvious reasons.

**Heatran**: Another Pokemon that resists Ho-oh's dual type. Heatran is similar to Hippowdown in that it sets up Stealth Rock vs Ho-oh, but it takes Brave Birds better and totally shuts down Sacred Fire. However, it has a very exploitable 4x weakness to Ho-oh's favorite coverage move Earthquake.

**Tyranitar**: Tyranitar hates burns, but does also provide Stealth Rock combined with the fact that a Stone Edge, even when burnt, will do a tonne of damage. Tyranitar is like most of the STAB resisting checks, weak to Earthquake.

**Groudon**: Groudon is another way of forcing Ho-oh with offensive presure. A fast Earth Plate Groudon can OHKO Ho-oh with Stone Edge or set up Stealth Rocks on the fleeing bird. It can switch in in an emergency, but fears the burn and inconveniently boosts Ho-oh's Sacred Fire, meaning it really cannot get in without taking big damage.

**Landorous-T**: Thanks to Intimidate, Landorous-T sponges Ho-oh's attacks quite okay, and while it fears the burn, it does have Stealth Rock to set up and doesn't boost Ho-oh's attacks like Groudon. It also carries Stone Edge that will OHKO Ho-oh unless Landorous-T is burnt. Intimidate also makes it easier for Landorous-T's teammates to pivot switch in.

**Physically defensive Ho-oh**: Can work as a decent sponge to anything that isn't Brave Bird. It is especially useful against Choice Band sets that incorporate a Flying-resistance. This way Ho-oh can switch in to scout, Regenerate its health and switch to the resistance if it gets in on a Brave Bird.

**Zekrom**: Interestingly enough, Zekrom both resists Ho-oh's STAB and provides offensive pressure as well, something few other Pokémon can do. In practice, however, Zekrom tends to fear the possible Sacred Fire burn too much to switch in directly unless it has to, but if it gets in, it forces Ho-oh out and can possibly build momentum via Volt Switch.



**Faster Pokémon that can OHKO**: Aside from the mentioned Zekrom, Kyogre, Groudon etc. there are some other revenge killers that can be used as a last resort for force Ho-oh out. Terrakion and Mega Mewtwo X with Stone Edge are two examples of this.

**Lures**: Since Ho-oh's 4x weakness to Rock is apparent, it usually a very good strategy to exploit it in the forme of lures. Rock Slide Xerneas, Head Smash Aegislash, Stone Edge Arceus Grass or Fairy, Stone Edge Giratina-O and Stone Edge Mega-Lucario are some popular lures that Ho-oh can fall to with some smart play. The key with Stone Edge Arceus is generally to lure Ho-oh into a false sense of safety and then smacking it when it is in OHKO range as a 252 HP Ho-oh “only” takes 80-94 % from a Stone Edge from support Arceus.

**Toxic**: Lastly, since Ho-oh has enormous staying power, Toxic on a Pokemon it commonly switches in to, such as Aegislash at least puts a timer on the phoenix and racks up the residual damage, especially with Life Orb and Brave Bird recoil.
