Overview
########
-gr8 typing, fuck fairies
-really good stealth rock setter

Stealth Rock
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Draco Meteor / Dragon Pulse
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Flash Cannon / Dragon Tail (?) / Roar (?)
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 56 SpA / 200 SpD
nature: Modest

Moves
========
-stealth rock is really good. Dialga can beat many defoggers ez: Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Fairy, Scizor, Giratina-O, Arceus-Water, etc
-dragon STAB is good. Draco Meteor got nerfed but dragon pulse did too.
-Fire Blast so that you aren't walled by Steels
-Flash Cannon is great for smacking Fairies
-phazing isn't as good for it this gen so not sure if slashed
-toxic and thunder wave are status options you can run pretty well, for example toxic is fun against cm arceus and ho-oh
-thunder hits kyogre and arceus-water harder

Set Details
========
-I just took the EV spread from last gen, lets you take two lustrous spacial rends and non-specs water spout
-max hp / max satk could work too and might be better

Usage Tips
========
-stealth rock up, proceed to kill things
-this set (with flash cannon) is very hard to wall for teams lacking Ho-Oh
-kill defogers since they can get rid of SR, usually they're weak to dialga
-dialga is a p. good backup check to stuff like Palkia, Kyogre, Zekrom, etc.
-beware of Landorus-T/Groudon as some run Earth Plate and can OHKO you

Team Options
========
-you're still gonna want to have a defoger on your team since you don't want to lose to sticky web/spikes
-dialga is pretty flexible as far as fitting on teams. It's ability to (kinda) check so much stuff means you don't necessarily need as hard checks for some things
-great fit on teams that really appreciate having stealth rock up all the time
-checks to ground types are nice, stuff like Gliscor, Giratina-O, Grass Arceus, Yveltal, etc

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Flash Cannon
move 4: Thunder
ability: Pressure
item: Life Orb / Choice Specs
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========
-yeah
-considering slashing stealth rock in here somewhere

Set Details
========
-timid sets with speed investment work great with this too

Usage Tips
========
-kill fucking everything
-specs isn't as good this gen, especially with fairies around, and dialga likes changing moves. But specs is still an option since it doesn't have recoil and is more powerful

Team Options
========
-have phazers or good walls as things will aim to set up on your after a draco
-switch-ins to scarf mons like kyogre and Zek since they're gonna aim to kill you after you've been weakened by LO recoil
-mons that can deal with Ho-Oh and Blissey since they can mess with this set hard

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Flash Cannon
move 4: Thunder / Toxic / Sleep Talk
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========
-draco meteor is nice powerful stab
-fire blast to roast steels
-flash cannon is reliable STAB that smacks fairy-types
-thunder hits kyogre, arceus-water, ho-oh, yveltal etc harder
-toxic can hit threatening things such as Calm Mind Arceus forms. good for OHSHI momnts when something might sweep you
-sleep talk lets you check darkrai

Set Details
========
-Modest gives you more power, timid lets you outspeed other base 90 scarfers, +1 adamant mega blaziken, and deoxys-a. I put modest first since dialga really wants all the power it can get

Usage Tips
========
-pretty solid scarf mon. while it isn't usually as powerful as say Zekrom or Kyogre, you have a better typing and defensive stats which allow you to check certain things easier
-does loads of damage to extremekiller who can't hit you hard with espeed
-this set can fake being scarfed quite easily
-don't expect to beat stuff like GeoXern, CM Mewtwo-y, etc

Team Options
========
-have another soft check to ekiller like Ground types or Scizor since you can't OHKO it
-this dialga is pretty good at checking most things in the game with the right move so in general you don't need as hard of checks for many things

Other Options
########
-Lum Berry is cool but Dialga really likes Lefties recovery
-Dragon Pulse is like Flash Cannon but is resisted by less. However, if you ran it over Flash Cannon you leave Dialga open to fairy types.
-Mixed sets. I didn't see the point with Blissey/Chansey being so meh
-Bulk Up. RestTalk is impossible now since Fairy-types are immune
-Aura Sphere over Fire Blast if you run kyogre as a teammate. Heatran is pretty rare though and you really want to hit Scizor hard.
