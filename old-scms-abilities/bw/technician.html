[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder uses a move that has 60 Base Power or less (including <a href="/bw/moves/struggle">Struggle</a>), the Base Power is increased by 50%. STAB and effectiveness modifiers are not counted when determining whether the move is boosted by Technician, but <a href="/bw/moves/helping_hand">Helping Hand</a> is. If a move has variable Base Power and would have 60 Base Power or less when used, it is also boosted by 50%. Note that while self-inflicted confusion damage is a 40 Base Power typeless move, it is not boosted by 50%.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Honestly one of the best abilities in the game; the main user of it is <a href="/bw/pokemon/scizor">Scizor</a>, who can inflict great amounts of damage with its boosted <a href="/bw/moves/bullet_punch">Bullet Punch</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/bug_bite">Bug Bite</a>. Other notable Pokemon include <a href="/bw/pokemon/breloom">Breloom</a>, who can take advantage of a boosted <a href="/bw/moves/bullet_seed">Bullet Seed</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/mach_punch">Mach Punch</a>, making it an extremely potent threat. <a href="/bw/pokemon/hitmontop">Hitmontop</a> can become a great revenge killer with the plethora of priority moves in its arsenal. You will see this ability a lot when you play OU.</p>
