[SHORT DESC]
The next move used will always hit.

[LONG DESC]
<p>The move used on the next turn will always hit. Lock-On ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers. If the target uses Detect or Protect the turn after being hit by Lock-On, then any attack by the user that turn has 100 - Accuracy chance to break through Detect or Protect. This ability to break through Detect and Protect does not apply to Fissure, Guillotine, Horn Drill, or Sheer Cold. Pokemon who are currently invulnerable to attacks from using Bounce, Dig, Dive, Fly or Shadow Force are still hit by the user's attack if they were hit by Lock-On beforehand.</p>

<p>When used, Lock-On applies an effect to the target consisting of two variables: the user of Lock-On, and a turn counter, which starts at two. At the end of each turn, including the turn Lock-On is used, the turn counter decreases. The next time that a Pokemon targets a Pokemon under the effects of Lock-On, if the first variable is the user of the move, then the move is guaranteed to hit, and the effect is removed. If the turn counter reaches zero without a move hitting, then the effect is also removed. When baton passed, both variables are passed.</p>
