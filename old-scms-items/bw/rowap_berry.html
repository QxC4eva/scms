<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder takes damage from a special attack, then it will consume the Rowap Berry, and the attacker will take damage equal to 12.5% of its maximum health. Natural Gift becomes an 80 Base Power Dark-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Interestingly enough, Rocky Helmet deals more damage than this Berry to the attacker, without even being used upâ€”albeit, to users of contact moves, which are usually distinct from special moves. But still, this Berry deals very little damage to the opponent for the huge cost of losing your precious item slot. If it were dealing 50% damage for any attack, then it might see some use. But at present, it's pretty much unusable.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Could only be obtained by competing in the 2013 International Challenge - March, the Global Battle Union Wi-Fi tournament, or found on the Share Shelf of a player who has competed in the past.</p>
