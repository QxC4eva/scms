Only super effective attacks harm this Pokémon. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>This Pokémon can only be damaged by super effective attacks and secondary damage. Secondary damage includes: hail, sandstorm, burn, poison, and Leech Seed. Furthermore, the attacks Beat Up, Bide, Doom Desire, Fire Fang, Future Sight, and Struggle will hit a Pokémon with Wonder Guard even though they may not specifically be super effective. If a Wonder Guard Pokemon uses a recoil move, it will still take normal recoil damage. Fixed damage attacks will only damage a Pokémon with Wonder Guard if it would be super effective otherwise. That is, Night Shade counts as a Ghost attack, Seismic Toss counts as a Fighting attack, and Dragon Rage counts as a Dragon attack.</p>

<p>Wonder Guard cannot be Skill Swapped or Role Played, but it can be Traced. Also, Wonder Guard can be copied by an opposing Pokémon transforming into the Wonder Guard Pokémon.</p>
