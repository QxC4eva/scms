<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This item, though it has a competitive function, sees very little competitive use because Psychic is not a commonly used type of attack, and most Fighting- and Poison-type Pokemon cannot afford to relinquish their item slot to use Payapa Berry.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Receive from Fennel on first visit to Dream Worldâ€”however, you only get one of the seventeen damage-reducing Berries, and this event cannot be repeated. If you do not receive a Payapa Berry in this way, you must trade for it using Share Shelves in the Dream World.</p>
