<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>What's up smogon, Donkey here. Normally I post RMTs on the PO forums,  but I'm posting this here to show off my team to a much more solid group  of uber players. In the last RMT I posted on the PO forums, someone  suggested that I replace Chansey with a Lanturn arguing that <a href="http://pokemon-online.eu/forums/showthread.php?9085-Groundon-Peaked-at-1&amp;p=107289&amp;viewfull=1#post107289">Lanturn WALLS specs ogre</a>... which it doesn't.</p>

<p>Anyways, onto the team. This team is probably the best team I've built.  It's currently sitting at rank one on PO and peaked around 1470 on  smogon. My old team had lots of problems with taunt and a few offensive  cores, but this one has very few weaknesses since it's a lot more  balanced. Sand is incredibly anti-meta in ubers, and when used well it  can be nearly impossible to beat. To use this team successfully, you  have to focus on wearing down opposing weather starters, getting up  hazards, and preserving Excadrill for a late game sweep. Groudon and  Kyogre have a very hard time staying alive against this team.</p>

<h2>At a Glance</h2>

<h2>In Depth</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/248.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Tyranitar (M) @ Lum Berry<br />
Trait: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 64 Atk / 184 SpD / 8 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Pursuit</p>

<p>Tyranitar is one of the best anti-leads in the current uber metagame. It  guarantees you sand 100% of the time, and also acts as a check to some  of the common non-weather leads. Lum Berry absorbs Dark Void and Spore,  allowing Superpower to bring Darkrai and Smeargle down to their focus  sashes, which are taken out by sand. Tyranitar single-handedly prevents  losing a pokemon to sleep and shuts down smashpass. Stone Edge is mainly  a filler move to hit things hard on switches and stop Ho-Oh/Rayquaza  from setting up (although Arceus-Rock can switch in on both of these).  However, Pursuit is the most important move on the set. Since Ferrothorn  can't really take specs Water Spouts, my usual switch-in for Kyogre is  Giratina. Eventually, my opponent catches on to this and locks  themselves into Ice Beam.  At this point, I'll go into Tyranitar, easily  take the Ice Beam, and do about 45% with Pursuit as Kyogre is called  back, quickly wearing it down. Pursuit is also nice to use on Palkia or  Reshiram after they Draco Meteor and drop to -2. Stealth Rocks rack up  switch-in damage and wear down the opponent's weather inducer.</p>

<p>Possible Changes: Roar or Dragon Tail could be used instead of Stone  Edge. This would rack up more hazard damage, while still preventing  Ho-Oh/Rayquaza from setting up. Roar is also guaranteed to stop  smashpass. Ice Beam can also work to help deal with opposing Gliscors  and still hit Rayquaza. Similarly, Fire Blast could be used to hit  Ferrothorn/Forretress/Skarmory, but I prefer having an all physical  Tyranitar to optimize my EVs.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/558.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Excadrill (M) @ Leftovers<br />
Trait: Sand Rush<br />
EVs: 64 HP / 252 Atk / 192 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Shadow Claw<br />
- Rapid Spin</p>

<p>Excadrill is a great cleaner and revenge killer. Any team, offensive or  stall, needs a pokemon that can sweep late game. Excadrill fits this  role perfectly with Sand Rush. However, weather inducers such as  Groudon, Rayquaza and Kyogre are the biggest threats to Excadrill since  they stop it's sweep. Defensive Ho-Oh can also be annoying since Shadow  Claw doesn't hit it very hard. This shows how well Arceus-Rock and  Giratina synergize with Exca. Rockceus can switch in on virtually any of  Rayquaza or Ho-Oh's moves and OHKO back, while Giratina takes hits from  Kyogre all day. Groudon is also worn down by Earthquake spam + hazards  pretty quickly (especially if I can burn it). Shadow Claw is  specifically for Giratina-O. Rock Slide doesn't do enough damage to  break Gira-O, so I prefer using Shadow Claw to help me spin. This being  so, Earthquake hits Giratina-A harder because of STAB.  Skarmory does  completely wall this set, but at the expense of Excadrill getting free  rapid spins. Finally, it's EVd to outspeed Scarf Terrakion in sand while  still maximizing its bulk. Excadrill not only can sweep, but provides  great defensive support.</p>

<p>Possible Changes: Lum Berry breaks Giratina-A easily, but it means that  leftover recovery is lost and Exca is worn down faster. Air Balloon  works well too, since then Exca only takes resisted SR damage. I  wouldn't recommend life orb, since it means you can't spam spins vs  skarmory.</p>

<p>Arceus-Rock @ Stone Plate<br />
Trait: Multitype<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 SpD<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Will-O-Wisp<br />
- Judgment<br />
- Perish Song<br />
- Recover</p>
 
<p>Arceus-Rock has a very special role on this team. It's main purpose is  to check Rayquaza and Ho-Oh, which can cause the rest of the team  trouble. Rockceus outspeeds both and OHKOs with Judgment, and can take  +1 Life Orb Earthquakes from Rayquaza. Ho-Oh can't do anything to it  besides land a burn. It also walls Specs Reshiram in sand, and  Will-O-Wisps Groudon (and other physical attackers) with the benefit  that common sun abusers such as Reshiram or Ho-Oh can't switch in on the  expected Will-O-Wisp as they would vs Giratina. Non-Timid SD Arceus is  outsped and burned while Arceus takes +2 Extremespeeds with ease.  Physical attackers such as Excadrill, Garchomp, or Terrakion are walled  by Ferrothorn and Giratina. With Perish Song, Rockceus also phases and  checks sub HC Zekrom, BU Dialga, CM Arceus forms (The forms that  threaten it (Fight, Grass, Water, Steel) are walled by Giratina-A), and  any last poke. In sand, Arceus also is able to stall out Mewtwo, Palkia, and Dialga. With Gliscor spreading toxic, Arceus's becomes very  threatening. It's not an easy poke to take down.</p>

<p>Possible Changes: Calm Mind can be used instead of Perish Song.  Arceus-Rock can then setup on Palkia and other special attackers, and  sometimes pull off a sweep. Since Kyogre is commonly brought it to check  it, if you predict right you can hit Kyogre on the switch.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/628.png" alt="" /></p>
  
<p>Ferrothorn (M) @ Leftovers<br />
Trait: Iron Barbs<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Sassy Nature (+SpD, -Spe)<br />
- Leech Seed<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Protect<br />
- Power Whip</p>

<p>Ferrothorn is a self-explanatory poke. With its evs maxed out in special  defense, its a solid check to TG Manaphy, CM/Bulky Kyogre, and Scarf  ogre. Protect helps scout scarfers, although Lustrous Palkia must be  watched out for. It's water resistance and steel typing makes it a great  option on sand, and synergizes well with Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock. If  Arceus-Rock is low health, Ferrothorn also sponges physical attacks,  particularly Zekrom. Leech Seed wears down pokes on switch-ins as well.</p>

<p>Possible Changes: Protect could be replaced with Thunder Wave or Toxic, but I find that Protect helps keep Ferro alive longer.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/477.png" alt="" /></p>
   
<p>Gliscor (M) @ Toxic Orb<br />
Trait: Poison Heal<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 200 Def / 56 Spe<br />
Impish Nature (+Def, -SpA)<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Taunt</p>

<p>Since this is a wifi team, I always lead with Gliscor vs Groudon. Taunt  stops SR, Toxic cripples Groudon for the entire match and stalls  offensive Groudon, and sub blocks dragon tail. Gliscor also beats Sub HC  Zekrom, dealing over 50% with Earthquake and forcing Dragon Claws or  Outrages. Gliscor is also great because it can switch in on Giratina-A,  stall mons such as Chansey, Ferro, Forry, Skarm, etc, and setup a sub,  Taunt, or Toxic/Earthquake on the switch. It helps put a lot of pressure  on any offensive team with a few stall pokes. Toxic also cripples CM  Arceus forms, which can be very important. Reaching 240 speed, it can  Toxic Ho-Oh before it can sub, Earthquake Tentacruel, and Sub/Toxic  stall any slower mon. Poison heal also means it can absorb Will-O-Wisps  for the team, which is very important for Excadrill. Gliscor is the most  fun poke to use on the team, and by far the MVP. Since it's set is  unexpected, it can really do damage early on.</p>

<p>Possible Changes: You can run either a larger speed creep to outspeed  other Gliscors, or a smaller speed creep to ensure that Ferrothorn Power  Whips don't break subs. Protect is always nice to have on Gliscor, but  there isn't really a moveslot available.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/492.png" alt="" /></p>
    
<p>Giratina @ Leftovers<br />
Trait: Pressure<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 244 SpD / 16 Spe<br />
Calm Nature (+SDef, -Atk)<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk<br />
- Will-O-Wisp<br />
- Roar</p>

<p>Special Defensive Giratina + Tyranitar is as close as you can get to a  counter for Specs Kyogre without using Shedninja (lol) or Gastrodon. As I  mentioned before, Giratina baits Ice Beam allowing TTar to Pursuit.  Giratina is also a backup SD Arceus check. Without physical defense EVs,  it can still tank one Shadow Claw and get a burn/remove lum berry. Gira  also phases CM Arceus forms and Mewtwo; racking up hazard damage with  Roar. Last but definitely not least, it spinblocks. Forretress can setup  on it, but in that case I usually try to predict around it. Gliscor can  taunt it and wear Forry down. Giratina is incredibly durable, and undoubtedly the best Kyogre check/Spin blocker in the game. Although  this set is taunt weak, the rest of my team doesn't have that many  problems with it.</p>

<p>Possible Changes: Dragon Tail instead of roar, but then sub Mewtwo, sub  Ho-Oh, sub Exca, and sub Steelceus all become big problems. The lower pp means that Giratina has to use its moves more carefully as well.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Ubers is a tier with consistent war between rain and sun, but Donkey  decided to go against the (sand) stream and use sand. With uncommon  Pokemon such as Rock Arceus and Gliscor, Donkey has managed to get  impressive peaks on both the PO and Smogon servers. With Ferrothorn's  Spikes, Tyranitar's Sand Stream and Stealth Rock, a sturdy spinblocker,  an offensive Rapid Spinner, and the annoying bat, the foe is put under  tons of pressure. But let's stop here, and go more in-depth, shall we?</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p>Tyranitar is an amazing anti-lead in the current metagame; besides  setting up the sand that is integral to the team's success, it is able  to tank hits from common leads, such as Dialga, thanks to its excellent  special bulk, and Lum Berry allows it to beat even Smeargle leads.  Gliscor could also take the lead spot in case Groudon is the opposing  lead, since it can easily prevent the latter from laying Stealth Rock  down with Taunt and activate Toxic Orb early, which can be very helpful  later on.</p>

<p>Ferrothorn's long lifespan thanks to Protect + Leech Seed + Leftovers +  immunity to sand damage and resistance to Water-moves makes it a very  reliable check for non-Choice Specs Kyogre, which can mess things up for  the team due to its heavy dependence on sand. The Spikes it provides  also put tons of pressure on the opponent; in fact, Spikes-stacking is  very threatening in Ubers because it's so difficult to spin the entry  hazards away with bulky spinblockers such as Giratina in the tier, which  Donkey utilizes to make sure Ferrothorn's job won't go to waste;  Giratina also serves as an utility counter to threats such as Extreme  Killer Arceus and Mewtwo, while it checks Kyogre.</p>

<p>Donkey uses two uncommon Pokemon to patch up a few weaknesses: Rock  Arceus and Gliscor. Rock Arceus is the team's only guard from threats  such as Rayquaza and Ho-Oh, which none of the other team members can  defeat by themselves. Rock Arceus's synergy with Ferrothorn and Giratina  also forms a remarkable defensive core that can take on the majority of  threats in the metagame. Gliscor is undeniably the most annoying  Pokemon in the tier. Personally, I just hate that damned thing. The  ability to switch into a variety of Pokemon and moves, be it  Choice-locked Thunders or Groudon and such, and proceed to SubStall them  away with sandstorm damage and Toxic is brutal. Taunt also stops any  attempt to lay down any entry hazards from Pokemon such as Skarmory,  Ferrothorn, and Forretress, which can become troublesome.</p>

<p>And last but not least, we have Excadrill. Excadrill's role mid-game is  to spin entry hazards away, whereas end-game it's meant to sweep the  opponent with the support of Spikes, Stealth Rock, and additional sand  damage. Together, Donkey's team puts a lot of pressure on the foe: be it  entry hazards, Excadrill being a devastating sweeper, or just stalling  with Gliscor, the opponent will definitely not have an easy time.</p>

<h2>Threats</h2>

<p>As solid as a team might be, each team will have its weaknesses, and  this team is no exception. Calm Mind Ghost Arceus and Fighting Arceus  can easily break through the team thanks to Recover, a high Speed stat,  and their coverage. Faster Gliscor can also be troublesome, as they can  Taunt Donkey's Gliscor, which is his only check, making it completely  useless. SubPunch Palkia can also be very threatening, as it can block  Ferrothorn's Leech Seed with Substitute and proceed to do tons of damage  with Focus Punch. Palkia will 2HKO Giratina most of the time with  Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage, whereas Gliscor's Toxic stall becomes  useless because of Substitute. Substitute + Swords Dance Garchomp is  also a threat, as Donkey needs to hit Will-O-Wisp with Rock Arceus—which  is less accurate in sand due to Garchomp's Sand Veil ability—or have a Swords Dance under Excadrill's belt to take it down, as Garchomp can take an unboosted Earthquake.</p>

<p>If Ferrothorn has been severely weakened, strong rain sweepers such as  Manaphy, Kingdra, and Ludicolo can easily break through the team with  their strong STABs and coverage. Dragon Dance Life Orb Salamence can  also tear this team apart after the team has taken residual damage, as  Excadrill is the only one which can outspeed it in sand. Rock Arceus is  easily OHKOed by a boosted Earthquake after Stealth Rock, Gliscor has  87.5% to be OHKOed by +1 Outrage after Stealth Rock, and Ferrothorn is  smacked by Fire Blast. Once Cloyster has grabbed a Shell Smash boost,  this team is pretty much hopeless, as everything is outsped and OHKOed  after Stealth Rock, bar Excadrill, which risks losing the Speed tie.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p> Despite these weaknesses, Donkey's team, which won him rank one on the  PO server and a place within the top five on the Smogon server, proved  to us all that sandstorm in Ubers is just as effective as sun or rain.  His team is probably one of the greatest sand teams the Ubers tier will  ever see. If you wish to learn Ubers, give this team a try on the  ladder; it will not let you down.</p>
