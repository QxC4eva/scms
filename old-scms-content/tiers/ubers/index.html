<h3>MUTE, Unova Region Challenge, and XY!</h3>
<p><em>~By Furai on September 25th, 2013.</em></p>
 
<p>XY just keeps getting closer and closer with every day that goes by, and we're all very excited for next month. XY has shaken Ubers more than Groudon's Earthquake does. Fairy-types' immunity to Dragon-type attacks, Steel no longer resisting Ghost- and Dark-type attacks, Mega Evolutions... We're in a smokescreen, as besides that, we no nothing else like their stats or new Pokemon type combinations. in the <a href="/forums/threads/xy-metagame-speculation.3488227/">XY Metagame Speculation</a> thread we discuss just this! We try to get a picture of the upcoming metagame and its threats, be it defensively or offensively.</p>

<p>XY's begin means BW's end. Two events are occuring as we speak to cherish BW Ubers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="/forums/threads/unova-region-ubers-challenge.3488691/">Unova Region Ubers Challenge</a>, in which challengers must not lose to five of Ubers' finest: blackstardust, Blim, Dice, Hack He Must, syrim, and -Manaphy-- as a Substitute, in order to be victorious. The challenge is hard, but not impossible, so have at it!</li>
<li><a href="/forums/threads/the-most-uber-tournament-ever-ii-signups.3488654/">The Most UBER Tournament Ever II</a>. In this tournament, teams of five will be split into five divisions, where each division will get a teambuilding restriction each round. The tour is obviously skills dependant, but more teambuilding dependant, so feel free to join <a href="http://mibbit.com/#ubers@irc.synirc.net">#ubers on synIRC</a> to discuss teambuilding and the Ubers metagame!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Evasion Clause - Now Unbanned & Possible Delay of Future Rounds</h3>
<p><em>~By Furai on December 22nd, 2012.</em></p>
 
<p><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3476224">Evasion Clause Voting</a> took place yesterday, and resulted in an extraordinary sight for a static tier such as Uber: Evasion Clause is now <strong>unbanned!</strong> That's are pretty exciting news, as Ubers will finally have a change in its metagame. The voting was decided by a majority of 64.28% that voted to unban (18 voters), whereas 8 voters called to keep it banned, and 2 abstained, including councilman and Ubers moderator Poppy. The day after the vote, many people were not amused by this, as we all know how annoying Evasion can get.</p>
 
<p>Furthermore, because of <a href="/tournaments/spl/">Smogon's Premier League</a>, next round just might be delayed as to not mess up the ruleset of the players during the league. We'll keep you guys updated; until then, see you around!</p>

You can see the full vote right over <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3474994">here</a>. But we do not stop there! The first round is over, and now we're up for the <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3475396">second round</a>: Evasion Clause. To vote, you must achieve a <strong>Glicko2</strong> rating of 2000 and a deviation of 55 or lower on the Ubers <em>Suspect</em> ladder. I wish you the best of luck; happy laddering!</p>

<h3>Suspect Testing has Landed in Ubers!</h3>
<p><em>~By Furai on September 18, 2012.</em></p>
 
<p><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3472454">It's the End of the World as We Know It</a>! Although it does not seem normal for Ubers to have suspect testing, we will be hosting a voting system for Ubers. Don't get too pumped up; as <strong>not a single Pokemon will be banned.</strong> We're testing something slightly different: the effects of the standard battle clauses on the metagame and its competitiveness. We will question whether species, OHKO, and sleep clause are broken; we will change the tier's banlist on the ladder constantly to test these clauses; we will change Ubers as we know it. Getting to vote in rounds brings you closer to the Tiering Contributor badge, so be sure to keep a high position on the ladder, be active on IRC, and show high-quality knowledge in the Ubers subforum! Ubers surely just took an interesting turn; be sure to stay tuned!</p>
