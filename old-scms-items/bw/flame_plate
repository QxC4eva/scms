[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that increases the Base Power of all Fire-type moves by 20%. When held by a Pokemon with the Multitype ability, the holder's type will change to Fire.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Fire Arceus isn't very hot defensively due to its weakness to Stealth Rock; however, as the fastest Fire-type in the game, Fire Arceus is a very dangerous offensive threat. It is capable of abusing sun to enflame its STAB Fire-type attacks, allowing it to incinerate the opposition rather easily with its mighty hits. However, Fire Arceus is generally useless if the sun is not shining, and it has to compete with Ho-Oh and Reshiram for being a sun team's token Fire-type.</p>

<p>However, it is generally useless aside from Arceus, as most other Fire-types find the power boost from Fire Plate to be too menial.</p>

<h2>Location</h2> 
<p>Abyssal Ruins, 1F.</p>
