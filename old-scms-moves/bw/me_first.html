<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user copies the move that the target has selected in that turn and uses that move itself, with the power boosted by 1.5x. Me First will fail if the target moves before the user, or if the target uses a non-damaging attack. If Me First is used on the recharge turn of a move that requires the user to forfeit a turn after its use, then Me First will copy said attack regardless. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute for the purposes of copying the move used on that turn. The following damaging moves cannot be copied by Me First:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chatter
<li>Counter
<li>Covet
<li>Focus Punch
<li>Me First
<li>Metal Burst
<li>Mirror Coat
<li>Struggle
<li>Thief
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>A rare move, Me First has questionable usefulness. While it can be a nasty surprise for an opponent, the conditions required to use Me First successfully diminish its utility somewhat. It also has low distribution, and most Pokemon that get it are either slow or are not offensive.</p>
