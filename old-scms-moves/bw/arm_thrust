[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. It has a 1/3 chance for the move to hit either 2 or 3 times, and a 1/6 chance to hit either 4 or 5 times. If a Focus Sash or the ability Sturdy is activated through one of the hits, another hit will KO the target. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate for every hit taken, and every hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock, Razor Fang, or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. Color Change will only activate on the last hit of the move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat all the hits as a single attack. If this move breaks a Substitute, the attack can still continue and hurt the target. If the target holds a Chople, Jaboca, or Enigma Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. If the user has the ability Skill Link, this move will always hit five times.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Arm Thrust has little competitive use due to its low Base Power. Even if Arm Thrust hits 5 times, it is only as powerful as Brick Break and Drain Punch, and much weaker than moves like Close Combat and Superpower. Though this move can break though Substitutes, Focus Sashes, and Sturdy, it will often lack the power to do so; similarly, the greater chance for a single critical hit will not let it break through a defensive booster. Therefore there is no recommended situation in which to use this move competitively.</p>
