

Overview
########

    One of the premier Dragons of the tier
    A powerful combination of bulk and strength
    Multiscale allows it to take hits at an even greater calibre
    Terrific offensive movepool allows it to threaten a majority of opponents
    Dragon Dance and Extreme Speed help patch up its lowest stat in Speed
    It can still be slow enough to be dealt with
    Its versatility is no longer its most potent trait, as many Dragons give Dragonite competition in much of its roles

Dragon Dance
########
name: Offensive Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 3: Extreme Speed
move 4: Earthquake / Fire Punch / Thunder Punch
ability: Multiscale
item: Lum Berry / Weakness Policy
nature: Adamant
evs: 24 HP / 252 Atk / 232 Spe

Moves
========

    Dragon Dance boosts Attack and Speed, readying Dragonite for the sweep
    Outrage hits crazy hard after a single boost, but locks you in and confuses you afterward
    Dragon Claw is weaker, but is safer if you're concerned about Steel-types and Fairy-types stopping your sweep
    Extreme Speed is one of Dragonite's main selling points, outspeeding priority users such as Mamoswine and Talonflame as well as Choice Scarf users
    Earthquake offers good neutral coverage and demolishes Heatran and Aegislash, while not making contact with the latter so as to avoid King's Shield
    Fire Punch hits Ferrothorn, Forretress, Scizor, and Skarmory, though they do not pose immediate threats
    Thunder Punch nails Togekiss and Azumarill, while still doing good damage to Skarmory
    Roost is an option on Weakness Policy Dragonite to reactivate Multiscale and take super effective hits better, but Dragonite dislikes sacrificing coverage or priority



Set Details
========

    Maximum Attack power with Admamant for greater sweeping potential after a single Dragon Dance
    Speed EVs enough to outrun Timid Noivern after a Dragon Dance, as faster threats can and should be hit with Extreme Speed
    Remaining EVs go into HP, which prevents a OHKO from +1 Genesect's Ice Beam (though Dragonite's greater Special Defense means Genesect will have to acquire the Download boost prior), and increase the chances of surviving Play Rough from Choice Band Azumarill and Mega-Mawile
    Held item determines what Dragonite can/should set up on
    Lum Berry allows Dragonite to set up on status users, such as Rotom-W, Trevenant, and Gliscor (provided they lack Prankster) and also helps snap Dragonite out of Outrage confusion
    Weakness Policy lets Dragonite take advantage of super effective hits that it can take, by virtue of Multiscale, from such Pokemon as Noivern, Sylveon, and even Tyranitar



Usage Tips
========

    Dragonite should aim to set up one Dragon Dance and clean up from there, so it should best be saved until lategame when its potential counters and checks are removed or weakened
    Lum Berry Dragonite can set up safely on walls that have little offensive power and rely on status for their form of damage, such as Chansey, or can save its Lum Berry to allow for longer sweeps using Outrage without interference from confusion
    Weakness Policy Dragonite can occasionally afford to switch into a super effective hit, though that would deny you the opportunity to boost your Speed; usually it would take advantage of a weaker attacker with a super effective move to either discourage its attack and keep Multiscale intact or hit Dragonite with a weaker move (allowing Dragonite to remain healthy), or net +3 Attack and +1 Speed in one fell swoop
    Lum Berry Dragonites should use Outrage as they can handle the confusion, while Weakness Policy sets can settle with Dragon Claw as they don't need the extra power or the chance to blow their sweep
    Do note that Dragonite cannot or should not be taking an STAB Ice-type move, regardless of Multiscale



Team Options
========

    Lum Berry Dragonite likes partners that can lure in walls for it to set up on: Greninja not only has access to U-turn to do this, but also knows Spikes to further support Dragonite, while Rotom-W and Scizor easily lures in Grass-types and Fire-types respectively
    Weakness Policy Dragonite would like to face off against Fairy-types, Rock-types and non-STAB Ice-type attackers: Noivern can either lure them in and U-turn away, or it can Switcheroo a Choice item onto them and lock them into a move that triggers Dragonite's Weakness Policy; the two can also weaken the opponent's Dragon checks to allow the other to sweep
    Regardless of Dragonite's coverage move of choice, Magnezone makes a great partner due to its ability to handle both Steel-types and Fairy-types, while also covering each other's weaknesses nicely; Magnezone can also lure in Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-types, the former two of which Magnezone can Volt Switch away from and bring Dragonite in unharmed
    Since Multiscale is a big factor to Dragonite's success, a Rapid Spinner makes a welcome teammate: Excadrill can take care of Rock-, Fairy- and Steel-types, while Starmie or Mega-Blastoise can cover Dragonite's Ice weakness
    While not essential, a Dual Screens user makes setting up with Dragonite even easier: Klefki is best for the job due to the good defensive synergy, and even knows Spikes to support Dragonite


Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Dragon Claw / Fire Punch / Thunder Punch
ability: Multiscale
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 Def / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Choice Band Outrage hits like a nuke, 2HKOing any non-resist at worst
    Choice Band Extreme Speed allows Dragonite to revenge kill sweepers
    Earthquake is Dragonite's best bet against Steel-types, hitting most for at least neutral damage
    Dragon Claw provides Dragonite reliable STAB
    Fire Punch hits the remaining non Ground-weak Steel-types hard
    Thunder Punch is for Togekiss and Azumarill


Set Details
========

    Since Dragonite cannot boost its Speed, nor can it make use of its bulk, a straightforward 252 Atk / 252 Spe works best, and can speedtie Pokemon such as Togekiss and Chandelure
    The leftover EVs are put into either Defense or Special Defense, as 4 HP EVs incur more Stealth Rock damage
    Choice Band lets Dragonite wreck without the need to boost
    Adamant maximizes Dragonite's power, which can allow its un-STABed Extreme Speed to hit fast, frail threats harder
    Jolly is a possible option as it lets Dragonite outpace neutral base 92s, which would include Excadrill, Gyarados, offensive Rotom-W, unevolved Lucario, unevolved Pinsir, Landorus-T and Mega-Garchomp


Usage Tips
========

    More oriented toward hit-and-run, as in leave a smoldering crater in the opponent's team before taking a break and going again
    Multiscale, tremendous power and Extreme Speed lets Dragonite take on almost any offensive threat one-on-one and come out on top
    Choiced Outrage isn't so bad when you consider that a direct switch-in with a Fairy-type will not lock Dragonite in, only after Dragonite has pounded something's face in can it not switch
    Can break offensive and defensive cores alike
    Preserving Multiscale is advised, but otherwise isn't a huge priority


Team Options
========

    The hit-and-run strategy of this set means the absence of Stealth Rock is mandatory; Excadrill, Starmie and Mega-Blastoise make great spinners that can keep up the offensive momentum while covering Dragonite's weaknesses
    Magnezone can trap Steel-types and deal with Fairy-types, Aegislash is also a good teammate that can punish the opponent's Fairies
    Hazard support is appreciated; Klefki and Forretress make decent choices as far as defensive synergy goes, as do offensive powerhouses such as Mamoswine and Tyranitar to keep the pressure on


Rain Wallbreaker
########
name: Rain Wallbreaker
move 1: Hurricane
move 2: Thunder
move 3: Superpower / Earthquake
move 4: Extreme Speed / Roost
ability: Multiscale
item: Life Orb
nature: Mild / Rash
evs: 164 Atk / 252 SpA / 92 Spe

Moves
========

    Hurricane offers good neutral coverage and hits most walls hard
    Thunder 2HKOes dual-types Fairies, troubles bulky Water- and Flying-types, and has decent neutral synergy with Hurricane
    Superpower nails Chansey and Tyraniter, while doing solid damage to Steel-types such as Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Heatran
    Earthquake hits Heatran and Magnezone harder, and also hits Aegislash
    Extreme Speed is used to combat faster opponents, and revenge kills weakened foes
    Roost gives Dragonite longevity, which can improve its wallbreaking capability


Set Details
========

    Max Special Attack gives its special attacks the most power
    Life Orb further boosts its power, securing several important 2HKOes on bulkier opponents
    92 Speed EVs outspeed minimum Speed Landorus-T
    The rest are dumped into Attack
    The nature lowers one of Dragonite's defenses, so take note what kind of attacks you want Dragonite to take, or what moves are already covered by teammates
    Use Rash if Dragonite is relied upon to take such attacks as Bug (U-turn) and Fighting (Close Combat) or to take priority better; use Mild if you want Dragonite to better take boosted Water attacks as well as Mega Charizard Y


Usage Tips
========

    Rain is needed if Dragonite wants to function properly
    Excels at breaking down defensive cores, especially Water + Grass cores which are hard for Rain teams to break through
    Dragonite's main job is to lure and/or remove Pokemon that trouble Rain teams, such as Keldeo, Ferrothorn, Breloom, Tentacruel, and Mega Venusaur
    The physical move of choice depends on what other Pokemon you wish for Dragonite to defeat


Team Options
========

    Politoed, since Rain is integral in allowing Dragonite to perform
    Ferrothorn takes Dragon, Rock and Fairy attacks for Dragonite; Dragonite takes Fire and Fighting attacks in return
    Rotom-W can take Ice moves for Dragonite; Dragonite brutalizes any Grass-type stopping Rotom-W
    Starmie and Mega Blastoise resist Ice while Excadrill resists Dragon, Rock and Fairy, and all of them can spin away Stealth Rock; Dragonite in turn beats Grass-types and can weaken certain walls for them
    Pure Fairy-types are one of the few Pokemon Dragonite has difficulty defeating, so Steel-types such as Scizor and Excadrill make good partners
    Pokemon that are stopped by walls such as Heatran, Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Chansey appreciate Dragonite's wallbreaking; Azumarill, Mega Mawile, Thundurus, Genesect and Scizor all benefit from the removal of these Pokemon


Other Options
########

    Dragon Dance + SubRoost to set up on bulkier targets, but mono-Dragon coverage is no longer great and Zygarde does bulky boosting better due to Coil
    Special attacking Dragonite has a very wide movepool to use, but superior options such as Latios, Hydreigon, and Goodra exist
    Specially defensive set with Dragon Tail and Roost, but cannot use its best support moves, Defog and Heal Bell, alongside Multiscale
    Wrap stalling, but Dragonite would encounter issues with Ghosts, recovery users or status conditions, due to its 4MSS


Checks & Counters
########

    Unaware Clefable ignores Dragon Dance and Weakness Policy boosts while retaliating with super effective Fairy STAB, making it the best counter
    Physically defensive Slyveon
    Fairies in general, though most have to watch out for boosted attacks or super effective moves
    Outrage stopped by Steels and Fairies, though Fairies can only respond if Outrage was used beforehand
    Quagsire, Skarmory, RestTalk Gyarados and Hippowdon can tank Dragon Dance Dragonite and either status, phase, or respond with super effective attacks
    Mixed Dragonite can be stopped depending on its physical move of choice: Goodra can stop variants without Dragon Claw, Aegislash only fears Earthquake, and Chansey can only be stopped by Superpower
    A much easier way to stop mixed Dragonite is to change the weather, though Dragon Claw variants will not be rendered totally helpless
    Tread carefully, status can stop WP but gives a free turn for Lum, using super effective moves on a WP set can lead to swift death
    Stealth Rock
