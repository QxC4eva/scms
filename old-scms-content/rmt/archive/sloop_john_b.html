<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This team was my bread and butter during st8. I used it every round until the semifinals in game 2 because I expected most people to use their best team game 2, and I was confident enough in this team to pull through. This team rose to the challenge, going 7-0 before I stopped using it. Before st8, I also used this team in smaller tournaments, winning a #ratemyteam cup, doing very well in battle city, and 6-0ing Earthworm. I'm posting this team for two reasons: first, nasty plot mew is great. Second, I really like how this team works. This team can either be a very stall-oriented team, wearing down my opponent with toxic spikes and jelli / forry / tran, or it can play like heavy offense, sacrificing my walls to set up hazards or get in a burn then letting my sweepers go to town. Sometimes BW demands that you play fast-and-loose with your walls and this team makes that easy. Team name comes from putting my itunes library on shuffle and choosing the first song.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/623.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Jellicent</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Water Absorb<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 200 Def / 60 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Scald<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>Jellicent is really underrated at the moment. Starmie has been seeing getting a lot of use lately and Jellicent can usually just shut it down, ensuring my hazards stay down the entire match. Shadow Ball is a move that I just can't live without as it allows Jellicent to 2hko the aforementioned Starmie, as well as pokemon like Latios and Alakazam that can otherwise maneuver around Jellicent and pose a problem for me. I don't miss Taunt at all. The neutral hit on Rotom-W is always nice as well. The SDef EVs are another thing I just couldn't live without, as not only does it allow Jellicent to always beat Leftovers Thunderbolt Starmie, but it also keeps the damage from Rotom-W's volt switches to a minimum, allowing Jellicent to break Scizor / Rotom cores. Jellicent comes in very handy sometimes, taking the pressure off Mew to take on strong fighters like Terrakion and Infernape, but overall it's probably my LVP. Still, the fact that it counters Starmie makes it very hard to replace.</p>

<p><strong>Forretress</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 SpD<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Toxic Spikes<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Gyro Ball<br />
- Volt Switch</p>

<p>I just love Forretress right now. It just completely shuts down so many popular Pokemon on both stall and offense such as Haxorus, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn. As long as Forretress is at a reasonable health these pokemon are not only useless, but actually made liabilities because they allow Forretress to set up its dangerous Toxic Spikes for free. When I have Toxic Spikes up, which because of Sturdy + Jellicent is nearly impossible to prevent unless my opponent has an absorber, all of the otherwise mediocre sets my team carries become deadly. Heatran becomes more annoying than Jirachi and Togekiss combined, and Dragonite and Virizion can both beat some of their common counters with Toxic Spikes up. Some powerful Band / Specs users such as Terrakion would otherwise be able to wear down my team with its powerful Stone Edges without Toxic Spikes in turn chipping away at its health. Gyro Ball is an essential move on Forretress so that it can actually threaten the offensive pokemon it switches in on, and I will never understand why some people would run Forretress without it. The last slot is a tossup; Volt Switch is very useful for unscouted Scizors (where I don't know whether they will use Swords Dance or U-Turn), breaking DragMag, and breaking Dragonite's Multiscale. I could instead use Spikes which is a bit more anti-metagame, as giving me more layers would be more punishing to Sub+Protect Gliscor, and it would benefit Virizion more than Toxic Spikes do.</p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD <br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Lava Plume<br />
- Roar<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>Everybody knows how Heatran works. It switches in on something it walls, tries to get a 30% burn on Rotom-W on the switch, protects, and switches out. Heatran serves as my specially defensive wall, being able to phase, get off stealth rock, and cause status helps the dramatically. Heatran serves as a pillar for my team, and takes away a myriad of weaknesses that I have. Heatran is my only way of taking on special dragons, which works well if they're choiced but not so great if it's a last mon CM Latias. I chose Roar over a status move because the latter seemed redundant with Toxic Spikes. What I really like about Heatran is that if I see in team preview that it will be close to useless aside from setting up SR, it has the bulk to stay in on Scalds and Hydro Pumps and go for Lava Plume burns before it dies.</p>

<p><strong>Virizion</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Justified<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Leaf Blade<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>When I built this team rain stall was at its peak and SD Virizion was being hyped as the rain stall killer. Because Rain Stall always carries a Tentacruel to absorb my poor Forretress' Toxic Spikes, I figured a rain stall killer would be helpful. Sadly, because Virizion lacks the ability to OHKO anything without a boost, most rain stall mons can just Toxic it and switch out. Thankfully, my other sweepers pick up the slack against rain stall. Instead, Virizion exists to provide good offensive and defensive synergy, making both a decent switchin to both Rotom-W and Tyranitar which bother my previous three pokemon, and a good Scizor lure, which is OHKOed by a little prior damage, paving the way for a Dragonite sweep. I've thought about changing this to the CM set because it wouldn't be as bothered by burns, but I really need Virizion to get strong quickly. Slow boosting would require me to switch out too much, and because Virizion is already pretty vulnerable to priority from Scizor and Dragonite I don't want it to get into that 60% range.</p>

<p><strong>Mew</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Synchronize<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Aura Sphere<br />
- Flamethrower</p>

<p>Hey Mew is actually pretty diverse and has a good movepool, who knew. Most of Mew's counters rely on it not being able to hurt much without Will-O-Wisp, which makes this set a great lure. Mew still beats Tyranitar, Scizor, and Terrakion, but I obviously have to be much more careful switching this in, which is where Forretress' Volt Switch comes in handy. If I get Mew in at good health, it's very hard to stop it from getting multiple boosts if it needs to because the OU pokemon with super effective STAB attacks are KOed by +2 Aura Sphere or Psychic. This means you need something with roughly the same power as a specs Latios Draco Meteor to OHKO Mew, which Heatran / Forretress / Jellicent can usually handle. This slot was originally Jolteon but I switched it to Mew because I noticed a weakness to Conkeldurr and Toxicroak, and I have not been disappointed. Use different Mew sets everybody, Taunt+WoW isn't the only thing it can do.</p>

<p><strong>Dragonite</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Multiscale<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 12 Atk / 72 SpD / 172 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Roost</p>

<p>My endgame sweeper. With Toxic Spikes support it's very easy for this set to get past pokemon like Perish Song Politoed and Unaware Quagsire, and is insanely hard to beat if I can get it in with offensive momentum. Heatran, most Ferrothorn, Forretress, and some Jirachi are set-up bait for this set, and of course a dragon that can get past a majority of the OU steel types is a huge threat. I've played games where I just sacrificed all of my other pokemon then led a comeback sweep with Dragonite when my opponent realizes they can't beat this set without Skarmory being able to Whirlwind it. I typically don't ask Dragonite to take many attacks even though it easily can because I want to preserve Multiscale as much as possible. I won a game because this Dragonite was able to set up on a CB Terrakion's Stone Edge, kill it, then survive a CB Dragonite Extremespeed and kill that. To put it simply, this set just wins games. </p>
