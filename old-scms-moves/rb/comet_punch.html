<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hits 2-5 times in one turn. There is a 37.5% chance to hit either 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% chance to hit either 4 or 5 times. All the hits will do the same damage as the first hit. If the first hit is a critical hit, all subsequent hits will be critical hits too.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>One of the numerous multi-hit moves. However, there isn't much competitive value for it at all, considering it has a very low Base Power, less than desirable accuracy, and shallow distribution. All Pokemon that have this move available have much better options for a moveslot, so don't use it at all.</p>
