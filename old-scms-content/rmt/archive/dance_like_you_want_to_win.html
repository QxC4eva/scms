<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello, this is a rather successful team that I made which won me a Smogon Tour and was used by both yan[sogeking] and Valentine in the semifinals of OST. It originally started out as a non-serious team with Latias and five Pokemon holding Focus Sash, but after playing around with it I realized that it wasn't that bad of an idea. As expected, this team plays really offensively and relies on Focus Sash to check a lot of dangerous threats which would otherwise sweep the team. As long as you keep hazards off the field, you have a decent shot at winning.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>
<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/garchomp.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Garchomp</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Rough Skin<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Garchomp is usually the Pokemon I lead with, but its goal is usually to kill the opposing hazard user rather than set up Stealth Rocks itself since this team would rather play with no hazards on the field. It can usually get two kills easily against Deosharp teams since they always lead with Deoxys, allowing me to get a free Swords Dance off. It also checks a bunch of threats, most notably Talonflame which has the potential to do work on this team, but generally Garchomp just comes out early to do as much damage as possible and die.</p>

<p><strong>Bisharp</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Defiant<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Knock Off<br />
- Iron Head<br />
- Sucker Punch</p>

<p>One of biggest threats this generation, Bisharp has few counters and can sweep at a moments notice. A lot of players rely on faster Pokemon such as Terrakion or Mega Tyranitar to revenge kill Bisharp, but Focus Sash lets Bisharp eat it up and turn the tables on them. It is also a crucial member of the team when it comes playing aganst stall, since it is responsible for removing Quagsire's item which could potentially open the door for a Charizard or Azumarill sweep.</p>

<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/breloom.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Breloom</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Spore<br />
- Bullet Seed<br />
- Mach Punch<br />
- Rock Tomb</p>

<p>Unlike Bisharp, Breloom lost a lot of popularity this generation due to Sleep being rebalanced and the prevalence of threats such as Charizard, Talonflame, and Pinsir. With that being said, Breloom is still really good at doing what it does, which is putting things to sleep and using its typing to beat down certain Pokemon. Both of the Unaware users do not like dealing with Breloom, and they are usually the only Pokemon stopping this team from running over stall. Once again, Focus Sash allows Breloom to take any hit and respond accordingly, although it should be played more carefully than the previous two Pokemon due to its vulnerability to sand. Swords Dance was replaced by Rock Tomb due to it being more useful.</p>

<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/charizard-mega-x.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Charizard</strong> @ Charizardite X<br />
Ability: Blaze<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 140 Atk / 120 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Roost</p>

<p>Charizard is the hardest hitting Pokemon on the team, and is usually responsible for breaking down the opponent's defensive core which lets something else on this team sweep easier. It is also a nice defensive check to Bisharp and Thundurus, which are always dangerous threats. Using max HP really helps with checking the Pokemon mentioned above, and this spread still manages to outspeed what it needs and hit hard at the same time. Valentine used 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe because she likes to go hard but I prefer to use Charizard as a bulky sweeper.</p>

<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/azumarill.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Azumarill</strong> @ Sitrus Berry<br />
Ability: Huge Power<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Belly Drum<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Play Rough<br />
- Aqua Jet</p>

<p>The best sweeper in OU in my opinion. Azumarill puts a lot of pressure on the opponent just by being there as most would rather not give it a turn to set up. It still manages to do so nearly every game though due to its excellent defensive typing. Azumarill also hits decently hard without boosting and is my main check to things like Conkeldurr and Dragonite. Once again Valentine likes to go hard and use Adamant but I think the ability to outrun Venusaur and Defensive Rotom is pretty important.</p>

<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/latias.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Latias</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Defog<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Psyshock<br />
- Healing Wish</p>

<p>The most important Pokemon on the team, being responsible for keeping hazards off the field. Although Latias only lives for a few turns during a typical game, those turns usually make the difference between a win and a loss. Healing Wish is an excellent move for this team as every other Pokemon is a set up sweeper that would love to have a second chance to break through again.</p>
