Overview
########
- Fairy typing is great.
- Access to Wish and Heal Bell make it a great supporter.
- Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice means that even the defensive set packs a punch.
- It is often compared to Clefable, over which it has higher bulk and the ability to hit much harder.
- Top Steel-type threats make Sylveon's life difficult.
- Wish + Protect gives the opponent free turns in order to keep Sylveon healthy.
- Low Speed means that many of the metagame's top threats outspeed and thus can hit it first.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Hyper Voice
move 2: Heal Bell / Calm Mind
move 3: Wish
move 4: Protect
ability: Pixilate
item: Leftovers
evs: 244 HP / 252 Def / 12 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========
- Thanks to Pixilate, Hyper Voice becomes a powerful STAB capable of dealing significant amounts of damage.
- Heal Bell cures teammates and Sylveon from status conditions.
- Calm Mind offers the ability to pack more of a punch or even sweep under the right conditions.
- Wish allows Sylveon to maintain the health levels of its teammates and itself.
- Protect grants reliable recovery and the ability to scout/gain extra Leftovers recovery as needed.
- Baton Pass is an option for Sylveon to fit nicely into VoltTurn chains and ensure its teammate gets a Wish unscathed.

Set Details
========
- Leftovers help Sylveon keep healthy.
- Full physically defensive investment patches up Sylveon's low Defense, allowing it to tank physical hits in a fairly respectable manner.
- Special Defense investment is also an option if you wish to make the most of its high Special Defense, but this compromises the ability to tank physical hits, and Sylveon is bulky enough on the special side as is.
- 12 Speed EVs are enough to outrun 0 EV Tyranitar.

Usage Tips
========
- The basic goal of this set is to take advantage of Sylveon's Fairy typing and sponge a variety of, mostly special, hits.
- Know when pass off a Wish and when to Protect. If Sylveon is running low on health and you absolutely don't need it, by all means, pass to another Pokemon. Or, if the opponent might set up for a devastating sweep on Protect. Unless this is the case, prioritize Sylveon's HP.
- Watch the 8 PP of Heal Bell. You shouldn't be trying to outstall status users with it&mdash;it should only be used as absolutely necessary.

Team Options
========
- Sylveon is at home on balanced/semi-stall teams, which appreciate the support and even power it packs into one teamslot.
- It's also much bulkier than Clefable in terms of special bulk at least, whilst boasting comparable special bulk.
- Pokemon such as Heatran and Aegislash that have to take hits constantly, but have no recovery, greatly appreciate Wish support to prevent themselves from being worn down.
- Sweepers such as Mega Gyarados enjoy the ability to take a paralysis from Thundurus's Prankster Thunder Wave, kill it, and gain their Speed back later thanks to Heal Bell. This also lessens the effects of things like Talonflame's Will-O-Wisp.
- Skarmory and Zapdos make for excellent partners because they can handle Mega Pinsir and Bulk Up Talonflame, which run all over Sylveon. Both can also handle Steel-type attackers fairly well.
- Pokemon to threaten Heatran and Skarmory, such as Keldeo, Manaphy, and Earthquake Latios, partner well because these Pokemon can come in on Sylveon and do pretty much whatever they want it front of it.
- Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Talonflame that threaten and pressure Mega Venusaur are key to ensure Sylveon isn't just destroyed by them.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Hyper Voice
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Hidden Power Ground / Baton Pass / Echoed Voice
ability: Pixilate
item: Choice Specs
evs: 244 HP / 252 SpA / 12 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
- Hyper Voice is the main STAB move; it packs immense BP (after Pixilate's bonus) and ignores Substitutes. It hits very hard.
- The other moves cover specific counters to this set.
- Psyshock deals large damage to Mega Venusaur, which is otherwise a perfect counter to this set.
- Shadow Ball hits Aegislash, another otherwise perfect counter to this set.
- Hidden Power Ground smacks Heatran where it hurts.
- Baton Pass scores free momentum against switch-ins, enabling Sylveon to avoid a sticky scenario.
- Echoed Voice lets Sylveon break through more defensive teams -- ones that can't pose an immediate threat to it, gradually increasing in power until little can take it.
- Hidden Power Fire is an option to OHKO Ferrothorn, which handles this set pretty well.

Set Details
========
- The EVs maximize bulk and power whilst enabling Sylveon to outrun minimum Speed Tyranitar.

Usage Tips
========
- Pretty much spam Hyper Voice -- it even does good damage to lots of resists, such as 2HKOing Skarmory.
- The time to use the coverage moves is on predicted switch-ins of their targets, and at no other time.
- The one exception is Baton Pass, which functions as a general safe option if you're not exactly sure what your opponent will do.

Team Options
========
- Pokemon like Fire Blast Garchomp, Latios, Mega Charizard-X/Y, Talonflame, and Entei are helpful at eliminating threatening Poison- and Steel-types for Sylveon.
- Sticky Web support enables Sylveon to go first against many grounded Pokemon, which is pretty great.
- Bisharp resists Steel and is immune to Poison, and can threaten their users with its powerful STAB attacks.
- A lure such as Earthquake Latios or Focus Punch Mega Mawile can remove Heatran from the game, making Hyper Voice spam much easier.
- Ground-types are great options to help eliminate both Poison AND Steel-types.
- Defog or spin support is critical because this Sylveon has no way of healing itself, and entry hazards can wear it down quickly, especially in conjunction with the hits that it's often forced to take due to its low Speed.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Hyper Voice
move 2: Echoed Voice
move 3: Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Baton Pass
ability: Pixilate
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spd

Moves
========
- Hyper Voice has great immediate power, allowing Sylveon to threaten a number of the offensive Pokemon it outspeeds due to its Choice Scarf.
- Echoed Voice can allow for sweeps when the opponent decides to go for a sac or something against Sylveon, or tries to stay in and get off some damage.
- Hidden Power Fire hits incoming Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory hard.
- Baton Pass provides switch initiative and thus momentum, basically functioning as a pseudo U-turn.

Set Details
========
- Full investment in Speed and a Timid nature are 100% necessary, as without them, Sylveon can't even outrun positive-natured Pokemon above base 100.
- Special Attack investment makes it as powerful as possible.

Usage Tips
========
- Basically, this set is used for Sylveon to go first and fire off its veritably powerful Hyper Voices.
- If you spy an opportunity to deal some serious damage or even sweep with Echoed Voice, seize it.
- Baton Pass is always the safe move when the opponent has Fairy resists that aren't hit hard by Hidden Power Fire.

Team Options
========
- This set fits best into offensively-minded balanced/bulky offensive teams.
- Pokemon to pressure Heatran, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Scizor, and other answers to Sylveon are extremely important.

Baton Pass
########
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Moonblast / Stored Power
ability: Cute Charm
item: Leftovers
evs: 208 HP / 252 Def / 48 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========
- Calm Mind + Baton Pass allows it to support the Baton Pass chain with Special Attack and Special Defense boosts.
- Substitute is great to protect the chain from critical hits, status, Leech Seed, and other such annoyances.
- Moonblast provides a nice Fairy STAB for Sylveon to function as a supplementary attacker. What it boasts over Hyper Voice is the ability to run Cute Charm; as Sylveon won't be attacking very often, it is generally better to gain some potential setup opportunities with Cute Charm.
- Stored Power allows Sylveon to function as another win condition for Baton Pass teams.
- Wish can be used to help keep Sylveon and the chain healthy.

Set Details
========
- 48 Speed EVs let Sylveon outrun positive-natured 110s at +2.
- The rest provides some much-appreciated physical bulk, which Sylveon can't enhance itself.
- Leftovers keeps Sylveon healthy whilst it boosts.

Usage Tips
========
- Sylveon is best-equipped to boost against defensive Pokemon and special attackers that can't do much to it.
- If you have Stored Power, it's important to consider that if you have enough boosts, going straight for the sweep is an entirely plausible option -- or even just to take out a pesky opposing threat.

Team Options
========
- This set should only be used on dedicated Baton Pass teams.
- Scolipede starts off the game with Speed and possibly Defense boosts.
- Espeon sweeps with Stored Power, and has Magic Bounce to reflect Taunt/phazing.
- Vaporeon provides important Defense boosts, and stops boosters from having any effect against the chain.
- Mr. Mime blocks Roar and Perish Song, and can create setup opportunities for the team with Encore, as well as provide some Calm Mind boosts itself.
- Smeargle prevents Roar and Whirlwind from affecting the chain at any point due to Whirlwind, generates free turns via Spore, and provides supplementary boosts if needed with Quiver Dance.\
- Mega Mawile and Mega Scizor are other possible options for Defense boosters.

Other Options
########
- Yawn can function as a pseudo-phazing move.
- Pixilate-boosted Hyper Beam hits extremely hard, and nets many KOs that Sylveon couldn't otherwise, but the necessity of giving free turns that is attached to it makes for a generally undesirable option.
- RestTalk allows Sylveon to heal against phazers and can make a Calm Mind sweeper set that doesn't have to worry about status. However, the RestTalk Calm Mind set is outclassed by Suicune, and lacking Wish/being asleep really blows.

Checks & Counters
########

- **Poison- and Steel-types**: Mega Venusaur, (Mega) Scizor, Heatran, Aegislash, etc. -- these are the biggest counters to Sylveon, as they can tank at least Hyper Voice well and threaten in return with their STAB, super effective, attacks.

- **Phazers**: Pokemon such as Skarmory and Heatran that can phaze ensure Sylveon can't heal itself with Wish, even ignoring Protect. This makes it much easier to wear down and generally deal with.

- **Powerful physical attackers**: Despite its rather respectable physical bulk with full investment, overwhelming physical attackers like Mega Charizard X and Mega Pinsir can rip right through Sylveon with their powerful, possibly boosted, attacks.
