[SHORT DESC]
Enemies' contact moves can paralyze them. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>When an enemy uses a contact move against this Pokémon, there is a 30% chance of paralyzing the enemy. If the attack does no damage, Static does not activate. Static still has a chance to paralyze Ground-type Pokémon, and those with the Volt Absorb and Motor Drive abilities.</p>

<p>When a Pokémon with this ability is first in the party, wild encounters with Electric Pokémon have a higher chance of occurring.</p>
