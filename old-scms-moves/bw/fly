[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user enters a semi-invulnerable state for the turn the move is used. The next turn, the user exits that state and deals damage to the target. If the move is prevented from being used after the user has entered the semi-invulnerable state, then the entire move is canceled, but PP is still deducted. The user cannot make a move between turns. If the user holds the item Power Herb, the user will not enter the semi-invulnerable state and simply deal damage to the target that turn. The user can still be hit by Gust, Hurricane, Sky Uppercut, Smack Down, Thunder, Twister, and Whirlwind while in the semi-invulnerable state, or if it was previously targeted by Mind Reader or Lock-On, or if the opponent has No Guard. Gust and Twister strike with double their usual Base Power when the target is in the semi-invulnerable state. The user will still take sandstorm and hail damage on the turn it is in the semi-invulnerable state. This move cannot be used while Gravity is in effect. This move also has an in-game effect that allows the player to fly to any town or facility with a Pokemon Center they have previously visited.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>One of those moves that sounds great in theory but more or less collapses in practice, especially competitively. It's basically Protect for the first round, and then an attack on the second. The main downfall of the move is the protecting part, as if you try to use it against something weak to it, nothing stops your opponent for simply switching out to a counter safely. The lower accuracy can also present a problem.</p>
