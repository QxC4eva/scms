[SHORT DESC]
Prevents the enemy from lowering this Pokémon's stats. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>This Pokémon's stat stages cannot be lowered by the enemy. For instance, Pokémon with Clear Body are immune to Intimidate, but still receive the +2 Attack from Swagger. This does not prevent the Speed drop from Curse, the Attack and Defense drop from Superpower, or any other stat loss caused by the user. It also does not block the effects of Heart Swap, Guard Swap, or Power Swap.</p>
