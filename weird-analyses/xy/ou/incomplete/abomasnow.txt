Overview
########

    Gained a huge buff in design and stats with MEvo
    Snow Warning helps wear down opposing foe's and access to 100% Blizzard is excellent and now has a stronger Blizzard the Kyurem
    Can run a devastating Offensive set with 132 / 132 Offenses
    Priority Ice Shard helps revenge kill top tier threats like Salamence and Garchomp and has much stronger Ice Shard now
    MEvo has good Defensive potential as well, so it can run SubSeed
    Lots of handy resistances, can wall Rotom-W and Starmie easily
    Sadly, it has to deal with a Stealth Rock weakness
    Terribly slow, especially after MEvo
    Hail only lasts 5 turns, so Blizzard can be a problem, since SubSeed sets stay in for a while
    Nasty U-turn weakness
    Weaknesses to common moves like Fire-type and Rock-type
    The skeleton says no Giga Drain, but has it now, so I'm slashing it in Offensive set with Wood Hammer
    Wood Hammer recoil and takes lots of hits for Offensive set (that's why I slash Giga Drain)
    Much better wall-breaker this Generation and being able to tank and wall lots of the metagame makes it good

Moves
========

    Blizzard is main move of the set and hits hard and has good coverage
    Wood Hammer hits even harder especially since it's invested, but Abomasnow needs to take recoil which can add up fast, since it's really slow, bu the extra damage could be what it needs to destroy most target Giga Drain can't like Rotom-W and Vaporeon
    Earthquake hits what it STAB can't like Heatran on switch
    Ice Shard picks off weakened targets and revenge-kills Dragon-types like Garchomp
    Focus Blast can be used to teach Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Aggron-Mega a lesson.
    Substitute can make this thing harder to kill and eases prediction and is best paired with Giga Drain to heal off damage taken from attacks and Substitute, it can be easily be set-up on Rotom-W which is very common. Volt Switch does about -19% Max

Set Details
========

    If you are using Giga Drain, a Quiet Nature with 252 SAtk EVs is recommended
    Soundproof is the ability to use because it can switch into Bug Buzz from Galvantula and Genesect and then MEvo and then it gets the benefits of Snow Warning
    0 IVs in Spe make sure it's really slow to minimize Gyro Ball damage and Brave Nature, so you don't minimize Def. Remember than Abomasnow-Mega has 30 Base Spe, so it's not a big difference
    Abomasite is a must and Abomasnow-Mega hits harder than LO Abomasnow
    You can run SubPunch or SubSeed with the first two moves for it to function as a bulky tank
        Ice Beam > Blizzard could be run because Abomasnow will stay in longer for Snow Warning's turns to end
        You can use Snow Warning if there are other Pokemon on your team that benefit from the hail such as Mamoswine and Kyurem.
    Rock Slide for Talonflame, but Blizzard pretty much OHKOes it

Team Options
========

    This set is a fantastic wall-breaker. anything that can take advantage of the wholes is a good teammate (Ex. Talonflame and yea, sweepers)
    It's SR weak, so try out Starmie or Excadrill
    This set forces lots of switches, so entry hazards will do very nicely espcially when combined with residual hail damage
    Heatran is always a good teammate
    Magnezone removes Steel-types which allows it to "BlizzSPAM"
    Rotom-W has excellent synergy with Abomasnow and eliminate their checks and counters

Other Options
########

    SubSeed
    ice beam but power loss is noticeable
    growth but speed is bad


Checks and Counters
########

    Genesect if it doesn't switch into Hidden Power [Fire]
    Volcarona can set up on non-Rock Slide variants or just roast it with Fiery Dance, or kill Substitute kinds with Bug Buzz
    Terrakion forces it out
    Aegislash can set-up on it then destroy it (Automatize sets can use the rather "lackluster" Earthquake to activate Weakness Policy and proceed to use Shadow Ball + Sacred Sword coverage to sweep the team).
    Scizor and Breloom (Breloom's Mach Punch hits before Ice Shard)
    Stealth Rock can ruin its longetivity
    Tyranitar destroys it too
    Air Balloon Heatran is good Counter and can kill it with Lava Plume / Fire Blast
    Pretty much any Fire- and Bug-type forces it out
    Talonflame can set-up on it or melt the snowman with Flare Blitz
