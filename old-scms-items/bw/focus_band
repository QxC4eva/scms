[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There is a 10% chance that when the holder is hit by an attack that would otherwise cause fainting, it will survive with 1 HP. Can also protect against recoil damage, multi-hit moves, and self-inflicted confusion damage, but not from Future Sight or Doom Desire or from self-induced fainting due to Selfdestruct, Explosion, Memento, Lunar Dance, or Healing Wish. It will not protect against passive damage such as sandstorm or poison.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Unreliable as they come—if you are willing to stake your all on a 10% chance then go ahead. Otherwise, more conventional items will generally serve you better—and won't only give you an advantage once in every ten battles.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Battle Subway, 48 BP.</p>
