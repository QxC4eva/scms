Overview
########
Dwebble has returned to Generation VI Little Cup, resuming its role as one of the most capable entry hazard setters in the metagame. However, since Berry Juice is no longer banned, many new options have opened up for the little crab. It has become a potent SturdyJuice Pokemon, utilizing this and Shell Smash to become a potent sweeper. With the change of the generation, Dwebble has not only maintained its role as a good Pokemon, but has also improved. Despite its incredible utility, Dwebble does have some glaring weaknesses. It’s outclassed as a Shell Smash sweeper by Tirtouga. Dwebble is also weak to Rock-type moves which are common among other entry hazard setters, Water-type moves which some late-game sweepers carry, and Steel-type moves which the now-prominent Pawniard carries.

Entry Hazard Layer
########
name: Entry Hazard Layer
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Spikes
move 3: Rock Blast
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Sturdy
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Stealth Rock breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy on almost all enemies and assists its team with securing KOs. Spikes can be stacked up to three layers. It is ideally used after Stealth Rock is set up or if the opponent has no Ground immunities. It can also assist its team with securing KOs. Rock Blast is the optimal choice as a STAB move for this set as it discourages setup sweepers, Substitute users, and opposing users of Sturdy or Focus Sash from setting up on Dwebble. Knock Off serves the same purpose in an entry hazard layer set for Dwebble as it did last generation, removing other Pokemon's items. However, Knock Off is now notably stronger and can significantly damage opposing Pokemon.

Set Details
========

Berry Juice is the best item for Dwebble as it functions well with Sturdy. By combining Sturdy and Berry Juice, Dwebble is capable of surviving for two or three more turns than expected. 236 Speed EVs allow Dwebble to outspeed the majority of the tier and Speed tie with much of it as well, giving it ample opportunities to set up entry hazards. No EVs should be invested into HP in order to reset Sturdy after Berry Juice is consumed.

Usage Tips
========

Oftentimes, the opponent will assume that Dwebble is carrying Sturdy and Berry Juice. They will subsequently switch out, allowing Dwebble an extra turn for laying down entry hazards. This allows Dwebble to be of more assistance to the team and can mean more KOs for your team later on. Having Dwebble as a lead means that it can get up at least one layer of entry hazards, unless the opposing Pokemon is a Taunt user. Since Knock Off was buffed, Dwebble won't have to deal with as many Misdreavus switch-ins. However, avoid running Dwebble against Fighting-types, especially those using Knock Off and Drain Punch as they can come out of these encounters victorious and with full health.

Team Options
========

Teammates that can prevent entry hazard removal are ideal, as they defeat this set's entire purpose; Ghost-types like Misdreavus block Rapid Spin and Prankster Taunt prevents Defog from being used. Defiant Pawniard makes a good teammate that can severely punish an opposing Defog user for trying to get rid of Dwebble's hazards, rewarding Pawniard with a hefty +2 Attack on the switch-in. Water-types like Chinchou, cover Dwebble's only two weaknesses in Water and Steel and are ideal partners for tanking some of the attacks that threaten it. Dwebble really appreciates something to switch into Mienfoo, particularly Taunt variants; Larvesta and Ponyta can threaten with a burn as it uses Fake Out, and Spritzee's ability nullifies Taunt.

SturdyJuice Smash
########
name: SturdyJuice Smash
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: X-Scissor
move 3: Stone Edge / Rock Blast
move 4: Earthquake / Knock Off
ability: Sturdy
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Shell Smash is the move that really makes Dwebble so threatening, because it makes it very powerful and very fast all in one turn. X-Scissor is a Bug-type STAB that deals considerable damage. Stone Edge is a Rock-type STAB that is very strong, but a bit inaccurate. Rock Blast can be used over Stone Edge to overcome Focus Sash and Sturdy, and it can potentially deal more damage than Stone Edge. While it is more accurate, the amount of hits it lands per use is totally random, making it less reliable. Knock Off helps with removing items and is more important in that regard than it necessarily is for coverage. Earthquake is an alternative that rounds out coverage decently well with Dwebble's Rock-type STAB attack of choice, and is notably good for nailing Chinchou. Earthquake is often considered more important than Knock Off as it is a means of getting around Steel-types, and provides a neutral move against Fighting-types. Dwebble is more of a late-game sweeper and therefore should rely on the fact that its counters are already weakened. Feel free to switch Earthquake and Knock Off to facilitate your team’s needs, as Knock Off helps it function as an early-game wallbreaker as opposed to a late-game sweeper.

Set Details
========

Berry Juice is the best item option for Dwebble, as Sturdy guarantees a turn of survival in the vast majority of cases and restores Dwebble to full health even if it was hit with a move that would normally OHKO, making Sturdy able to activate a second time in the process. A Speed stat of 15 guarantees it will outspeed most Choice Scarf users after a Shell Smash. Attack is maxed out to provide Dwebble with the highest sweeping ability possible after setting up with Shell Smash. No EVs should be placed into HP, as raising Dwebble's HP would keep Berry Juice from resetting Sturdy upon use.

Usage Tips
========

Dwebble can easily set up with Shell Smash against almost any attacker in the tier. The only Pokemon that it has problems with are Fighting-types primarily because of Knock Off, Steel-types, multi-hit moves, especially Rock Blast, Fake Out, which break Sturdy, and status moves, like burns or paralysis. Steel-types are easier to handle if Earthquake is included on the set, but Knock Off can be particularly helpful in breaking down walls.

Team Options
========

Spritzee and Trubbish make good partners for helping Dwebble beat Fighting-types, as they resist both of Dwebble's STABs and can be very problematic for them. Trubbish can also set up Spikes, which Dwebble appreciates. Chinchou can help with tanking the Water- and Steel-type attacks aimed at Dwebble, and is particularly useful for keeping Magnemite at bay. Fire- or Fighting-type partners are good for threatening Steel-types as well, particularly Pawniard and Ferroseed. Dwebble appreciates entry hazard removal with support Defog or Rapid Spin if it is to be used in a position other than as a lead, as entry hazards break its Sturdy and can ruin its SturdyJuice Shell Smash strategy.

Other Options
########

Aerial Ace hits the Fighting-types that wall both of Dwebble's STABs, but is on the weak side and is additionally not useful at all outside of that. Poison Jab is a nice surprise for the Fairy-types that wall Dwebble's X-Scissor, though it's a useless move otherwise. Rock Slide is an option over Rock Blast that has a more controllable damage range than Rock Blast and has the same accuracy. Flail can be used with Shell Smash and Sturdy to deal insane damage after being taken to 1 HP, but the amount of priority users in the tier make this a bad idea more often than not; Berry Juice is also too good not to use. Counter can be used to surprise the Fighting-types that normally have little to fear from Dwebble as well as other physically inclined foes, and can work well with Sturdy, but it's hard to find room on a set for this option.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Scraggy, Mienfoo, and Timburr as well as a few others, threaten Dwebble. They resist all its STABs as well as most of the moves that Dwebble normally carries. Fighting-types that carry Knock Off and Drain Punch can bypass Dwebble's SturdyJuice strategy completely.

**Steel-types**: Pawniard, Magnemite, and Ferroseed especially resist Dwebble's STABs and hit back with a super effective move.

**Burn**: Will-O-Wisp and Scald users threaten both sets by breaking Sturdy with a burn. It can especially hinder a Shell Smash set, as it relies on its Attack to break through opponents.

**Prankster Paralysis**: Purrloin and Cottonee can get off a Thunder Wave before Dwebble can even move. This slows Dwebble down significantly and has a chance of keeping it from moving.

**Trick / Switcheroo**: Dwebble absolutely hates being deprived of its Berry Juice, but even more than that it hates to have it replaced with a crippling item that renders it useless, such as a Choice item or Flame Orb.

**Taunt users**: Taunt users such as Mienfoo or Misdreavus can prevent Dwebble using Shell Smash or setting up entry hazards.
