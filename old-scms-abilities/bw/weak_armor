[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Whenever the wielder takes damage from a physical attack (not recoil from a move such as <a href="/bw/moves/flare_blitz">Flare Blitz</a>), its Defense is lowered by one stage, and its Speed is raised by one stage. Weak Armor activates on each hit of a multi-hit move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/kabutops">Kabutops</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/omastar">Omastar</a> appreciate ways of boosting their Speed with the complex ban on <a href="/bw/abilities/drizzle">Drizzle</a> in effect, but the lowering of Defense, coupled with their weakness to priority moves, makes it a very risky tactic to try.</p>
