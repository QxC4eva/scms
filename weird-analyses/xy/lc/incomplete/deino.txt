Checks & Counters
########

-Fairy-type: Immune to Outrage and resists Superpower and Crunch and can ohko with Fairy-type move. Spritzee is an amazing counter out of the Fairies.
-Meditite: Specifically Choice Scarf Tite can take a hit on the switch and can ohko with Drain Punch and heal all the damage taken.
-Timburr: Can take the hit and ko with either Drain Punch or Mach Punch
