<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holders Special Defense can be raised, it is raised one stage when HP falls to 25% or less. One-time use.</p>


<p>Provides a one-time 80 Base Power Grass-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Despite being part of the pinch Berry family, the Apicot Berry will only activate with the wrong effect at the worst moment possible. Like the other pinch Berries, the Apicot Berry requires the user's health to be well under 25%, which isn't exactly the best opportunity to boost your Pokemon's Special Defense. At this point, the user is in definite KO range, meaning that a Special Defense boost would be a wasted effort. Unless your Pokemon has some reliable way to recover health instantly, the Apicot Berry should never be an option over staple items such as Leftovers.</p>
