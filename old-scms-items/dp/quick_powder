Doubles Ditto's Speed.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder's current species is Ditto, Speed is doubled.. The boost is lost when Ditto Transforms.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Although Ditto definitely could use the extra Speed to help itself Transform into the opposing Pokemon, Quick Powder is generally not a good item for it to hold. The problem is, Ditto loses the Speed boost from the Quick Powder upon Transforming, thus making it a useless item for Ditto after its first turn in battle, and leaving Ditto in a worse situation than whatever it used Transform on.</p>

<p>As such, if you insist on using Ditto, it will usually be a better idea to give it an item that will still be useful after it uses Transform. <a href="/dp/items/leftovers">Leftovers</a> fits this well, since it's rarely a bad item choice no matter what Ditto becomes. A <a href="/dp/items/focus_sash">Focus Sash</a> could also be useful to keep Ditto alive long enough to use Transform.</p>
