<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Entry hazards have been one of the most important aspects of competitive battling for a long time. With threats such as Yanmega, Chandelure, and Darmanitan being quite prominent, the presence of Spikes and Stealth Rock is vital to eliminating them. Entry hazards also play an important role in attaining needed KOes and racking up damage with switches. With the myriad of hazard setters and few spinners present in the UU tier, hazards are fairly difficult to remove from the field. With this taken into account, Pokemon such as Blastoise, Claydol, and Xatu have risen in usage, and this guide will introduce the many aspects of entry hazards in UU.</p>

<h3>Stealth Rock</h3>

<p>Stealth Rock is the most common of entry hazards in any tier. Out of the three available entry hazards, Stealth Rock is arguably the easiest to set up. Requiring only one turn to be used to its fullest effect, it's arguably the most influential entry hazard. Without its presence, threats such as Yanmega and Chandelure become much harder to eliminate, but with it, they are much easier to deal with, as they have a much more limited lifespan due to the Rock-type damage it inflicts. Stealth Rock is also the lone hazard that no Pokemon is immune to, bar users of Magic Guard, which are rare sights in UU. Additionally, it is the most widely distributed, so it can easily fit onto any team.</p>

<h3>Spikes</h3>

<p>Spikes is the oldest of entry hazards, and is quite a reliable one too. Spikes offers a consistent 25% damage output after three layers, which is very useful for stall teams to keep racking up damage with. Spikes also helps with offensive teams, wearing down walls and turning some 2HKOs into OHKOs. After all three layers have been set up, it will be very hard for the opposition to act, as Spikes damage stacks up much more quickly than Stealth Rock. The only major drawback to Spikes is that Pokemon with Levitate as well as Flying-types are immune to it. Although it takes three turns to set up, this is mitigated by the fact that most of its users have enough bulk or Speed to pull this job off effectively.</p>

<h3>Toxic Spikes</h3>

<p>Toxic Spikes is the least used of entry hazards, and for good reason. There are numerous Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes, and with Pokemon such as Roserade, Nidoqueen, and Qwilfish being some of the more popular Pokemon in the tier, Toxic Spikes are very difficult to keep on the field. The effect of Toxic Spikes is also ignored by Pokemon with Levitate, such as Bronzong, Azelf, and Claydol, the last of which can spin the Toxic Spikes away, as well as Pokemon of the Steel typing such as Empoleon and Bisharp. However, once said Pokemon are eliminated, Toxic Spikes comes with its lethal effect; poisoning the target after one layer, and badly poisoning after two. This can wear down walls such as Cofagrigus and Snorlax at a steady pace, and if a spinner or cleric is not used, it can be very hard to deal with the poison damage.</p>

<h2>The Users</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/442.png" alt="Bronzong"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/bronzong">Bronzong</a></strong><br />
Type: Steel / Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 67 HP / 89 Atk / 116 Def / 79 SpA / 116 SpD / 33 Spe<br />
Abilities: Levitate / Heatproof / <em>Heavy Metal</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>When it comes to users of Stealth Rock, Bronzong comes to the table as one of the most reliable of them. With a great Steel / Psychic typing along with a fantastic ability in Levitate, Bronzong can take many hits. This is further complemented by great 67 / 116 / 116 defenses, making Bronzong the epitome of a sturdy Stealth Rock user. Thanks to these qualities, Bronzong will find many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock, while also being able to wall a sizable portion of the metagame. Bronzong's low Speed stat allows it to utilize Gyro Ball very effectively, ensuring Bronzong will be able to dish out some damage, so it's still capable of doing decent damage. However, one of the downsides to Bronzong is how prone it is to spinners such as Blastoise as well as Taunt and Magic Bounce users. Nonetheless, when it comes to setting up Stealth Rock in UU, Bronzong is one of the best.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/487.png" alt="Azelf"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/azelf">Azelf</a></strong><br />
Type: Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 125 Atk / 70 Def / 125 SpA / 70 SpD / 115 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Azelf enters BW UU as one of the few surviving dedicated leads in the fifth generation. Azelf is the second fastest user of Stealth Rock available in UU, which means he will always be sure to get Stealth Rock up on the battlefield, unless there happens to be a Sableye with Taunt. Speaking of which, Azelf has access to Taunt himself, so he can stop other users of Stealth Rock or Spikes from setting up. Azelf also sports high offensive stats, so he can put sizable dents in the opponent with Psyshock or Psychic. He also has decent coverage to boot, so he can definitely do some damage with Psyshock and Fire Blast after setting up Stealth Rock. Overall, Azelf can make for a great lead to quickly set up Stealth Rock, stop the opposition from setting up, and deal good damage to the opponent.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/344.png" alt="Claydol"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/claydol">Claydol</a></strong><br />
Type: Ground / Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 70 Atk / 105 Def / 70 SpA / 120 SpD / 75 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Claydol stands out from other Stealth Rock users with its good bulk as well as its ability to both set up Stealth Rock and spin hazards away. This gives Claydol its role as a solid utility Pokemon; thanks to its good bulk and resistances to Electric, Psychic, and Ground, it will be sure to set up Stealth Rock quite a few times in the match. Claydol also boasts the unique ability to use Rapid Spin as well, so while setting up, it can also remove entry hazards from its side of the field. If needed, Claydol could also set up Light Screen and Reflect to support its team even further. Claydol's ultimate downfall is its weak offensive stats, so it usually fails to do much damage to the opposition. It also has numerous exploitable weaknesses, especially to Dark, making it prone to being trapped by Pursuit. Nonetheless, if you want a Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock and be a solid supporter, look no further than Claydol.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/469.png" alt="Rhyperior"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/rhyperior">Rhyperior</a></strong><br />
Type: Ground / Rock<br />
Base Stats: 115 HP / 140 Atk / 130 Def / 55 SpA / 55 SpD / 40 Spe<br />
Abilities: Lightningrod / Solid Rock / <em>Reckless</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Rhyperior is a very solid user of Stealth Rock. With an immunity to Electric, a great ability in Solid Rock, and STABs that provide great coverage together, Rhyperior can fit on many teams. His big perks are his ability to reliably check the Electric-types running rampant in UU, namely Raikou, Zapdos, and Rotom-H. Thanks to this, he can set up Stealth Rock very reliably, which is useful for any team in need of a hand. Rhyperior also has decent resistances to Normal and Fire, meaning he can take onslaughts from Snorlax and Darmanitan. This gives him numerous opportunities to set up. On top of that, Rhyperior has a massive 140 Attack, and when combined with great two-move coverage, he can deal a lot of damage to numerous Pokemon in the tier, ensuring he's no sitting duck. Rhyperior also has Dragon Tail in order to shuffle the opponent's team, so he can take advantage of the Stealth Rock he sets. However, Rhyperior lacks recovery, which hampers his ability to set up numerous times. He also has multiple weaknesses, which must be kept in mind. However, if you want a solid Stealth Rock user who can check Raikou and Zapdos, as well as dish out damage, Rhyperior is the choice to consider.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/668.png" alt="Cobalion"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/cobalion">Cobalion</a></strong><br />
Type: Steel / Fighting<br />
Base Stats: 91 HP / 90 Atk / 129 Def / 90 SpA / 72 SpD / 108 Spe<br />
Ability: Justified<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Cobalion may seem like an odd choice for a Stealth Rock user, but his access to a coveted Fighting STAB, great Steel typing, and a high base 129 Defense, Cobalion is very capable of laying Stealth Rock down on the field. His great 108 Speed is also a nice asset, allowing him to outspeed a good portion of the metagame, which is a plus when it comes to setting up Stealth Rock, ensuring he will do it before going down. Cobalion also has access to the rare Volt Switch, allowing him to keep up momentum by switching out of common switch-ins while dealing decent damage. It also dents Blastoise, the most common spinner in the tier. His usable mixed attacking stats also ensure that Cobalion does more than set up Stealth Rock. Additionally, he has Thunder Wave to cripple opponents. All in all, Cobalion is a good choice for setting up Stealth Rock while being a defensive pivot.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/260.png" alt="Swampert"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/swampert">Swampert</a></strong><br />
Type: Water / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 110 Atk / 90 Def / 85 SpA / 90 Def / 60 Spe<br />
Abilities: Torrent / <em>Damp</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Say hello to Swampert, a Pokemon who was in OU the previous two generations, a testament to just how good it is. Swampert stands out from other Stealth Rock users with its great typing, giving it only one weakness, albeit a big one. This, when combined with its good 100 / 90 / 90 defenses, makes Swampert one of the better users of Stealth Rock in the tier. Swampert can come in on some of UU's strongest physical attackers, such as Darmanitan and Choice Scarf Flygon, and set up the hazard. Swampert also has access to Roar, allowing it to shuffle the team and rack up Stealth Rock damage. Its 110 Attack stat ensures that it isn't a sitting duck either, and can deal some damage with Earthquake and Waterfall, especially to the things it can set up on, particularly Darmanitan. However, Swampert has no reliable recovery, which limits its ability to set up Stealth Rock numerous times in the match.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/398.png" alt="Empoleon"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/empoleon">Empoleon</a></strong><br />
Type: Water / Steel<br />
Base Stats: 84 HP / 86 Atk / 88 Def / 111 SpA / 101 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Abilities: Torrent / <em>Defiant</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Empoleon sports a unique Water / Steel typing, granting it a myriad of resistances, allowing it to take on threats such as Snorlax. This makes Empoleon a great candidate for Stealth Rock, as it can utilize its great defensive typing to reliably set up Stealth Rock numerous times in the match. Empoleon also comes with a usable base 111 Special Attack, allowing it to deal decent chunks of damage with Scald and Ice Beam. Like Swampert, Empoleon also has access to Roar, giving it the ability to shuffle the team to rack up damage from Stealth Rock. However, Empoleon is weak to Fighting-type attacks, making it easy bait for dangerous Pokemon such as Heracross and Mienshao. It also lacks any form of reliable recovery, something you must keep in mind.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/379.png" alt="Registeel"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/registeel">Registeel</a></strong><br />
Type: Steel<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 75 Atk / 150 Def / 75 SpA / 150 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Abilities: Clear Body / <em>Light Metal</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Registeel is a defensive behemoth, sporting gargantuan 150 defensive stats and a Steel typing granting it numerous resistances. This makes Registeel one of the sturdiest users of Stealth Rock. Registeel can wall a myriad of threats such as Yanmega, Shaymin, and Raikou without much trouble, and this allows it to set up Stealth Rock numerous times in the match. Thunder Wave is also a plus to using Registeel, which allows it to cripple opponents, making setting up Stealth Rock an easier task. However, Registeel lacks any offensive presence and often provides free switch-ins for dangerous Pokemon such as Mienshao and Rhyperior. Therefore, Registeel will usually face stiff competition from the likes of other users of Stealth Rock such as Bronzong, Cobalion, and Empoleon, which are things you must keep in mind before choosing Registeel as your hazard setter.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/207.png" alt="Gligar"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/gligar">Gligar</a></strong><br />
Type: Ground / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 75 Atk / 105 Def / 35 SpA / 65 Def / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Hyper Cutter / Sand Veil / <em>Immunity</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Gligar may seem inferior to other Stealth Rock users due to his inferior stats, but his physical bulk, when boosted by Eviolite, reaches nearly unreachable levels. This, along with useful resistances to Fighting, Electric, and Ground, grant Gligar many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock throughout the match. His access to other supportive moves such as Toxic and Taunt are useful assets as well, which ensure he can do more than set up Stealth Rock. While the use of Eviolite may seem detrimental, Gligar makes up for that with his access to Roost, ensuring he will last even longer to be able to set up. Immunity along with a Ground typing make him immune to both Thunder Wave and Toxic, making him less prone to being crippled. His usable 75 Attack stat is decent enough to utilize Earthquake and U-turn to deal decent damage, as well as switch out in the latter's case. Just be careful that Gligar's lack of offensive presence makes him massive setup fodder, so as he sets up Stealth Rock, he may attract some dangerous Pokemon such as Abomasnow and Slowbro or give dangerous setup opportunities.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/653.png" alt="Golurk"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/golurk/uu">Golurk</a></strong><br />
Type: Ground / Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 89 HP / 124 Atk / 80 Def / 55 SpA / 80 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Abilities: Klutz / Iron Fist / <em>No Guard</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Golurk does a fairly solid job when it comes to setting up Stealth Rock. Golurk is unique in that it is the only Ghost-type with access to Stealth Rock, which means it can set up Stealth Rock and prevent the opponent from spinning it away. Golurk packs great resistances to Rock and Bug while it also has immunities to Normal, Fighting, and Electric. This, along with its usable 89 / 80 / 80 defenses grant Golurk many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock against common threats such as Snorlax, Raikou, and Mienshao. Golurk isn't a sitting duck either; it has a great 124 Attack stat to put pressure on the opposition. That said, Golurk does sport numerous exploitable weaknesses which, besides making it bait for common threats such as Roserade and Weavile, give Golurk a hard time against UU's most popular spinner, Blastoise, which can make spinblocking hard. Therefore, it is advisable to pair Golurk up with a second Ghost-type such as Cofagrigus if you want to keep Stealth Rock on the field for long.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/651.png" alt="Druddigon"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/druddigon/uu">Druddigon</a></strong><br />
Type: Dragon<br />
Base Stats: 77 HP / 120 Atk / 90 Def / 60 SpA / 90 SpD / 48 Spe<br />
Abilities: Rough Skin / Sheer Force / <em>Mold Breaker</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>If you can overlook Druddigon's horrible design, you can find that it has quite a lot of unique qualities for a Stealth Rock user. The first thing that stands out is that Druddigon has the rare Dragon type, which gives it some useful resistances. Combine this with its good 77 / 90 / 90 defenses and it can set up Stealth Rock reliably throughout the match. Rough Skin is an extremely useful ability, which aside from wearing down physical attackers, especially Darmanitan, also chips HP away when the opponent uses Rapid Spin, meaning Blastoise and Claydol can be worn down to the point where they cannot spin. Druddigon also has access to both Roar and Dragon Tail, so it can shuffle the team and rack up damage from the Stealth Rock it sets up. 120 Attack is no pittance either and can hit for solid damage, so Druddigon isn't just about residual damage. Overall, Druddigon is a great Stealth Rock user who can wear the team down with residual damage.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/485.png" alt="Uxie"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/uxie/uu">Uxie</a></strong><br />
Type: Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 75 Atk / 130 Def / 75 SpA / 130 Def / 95 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Although Uxie is generally overlooked by other Stealth Rock users, such as his brother Azelf for his higher speed and offenses, Claydol with its access to Rapid Spin, and Bronzong who sports the coveted Steel typing, Uxie does have his perks. Uxie has strong 75 / 130 / 130 defenses, and when combined with a Psychic typing and Levitate, make him a great check to threats such as Nidoqueen and Mienshao. This grants Uxie many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock throughout the match. Uxie's support movepool is a boon as well, as he has access to Thunder Wave to cripple opponents, as well as Yawn to force switches (and rack up hazard damage). U-turn is Uxie's biggest selling point and allows him to switch out so he can come in later to set up Stealth Rock again if needed. However, Uxie's pitiful offenses are his ultimate downfall, often causing Uxie to kill offensive momentum, something you must keep in mind before using Uxie as a Stealth Rock user.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/142.png" alt="Aerodactyl"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/aerodactyl/uu">Aerodactyl</a></strong><br />
Type: Rock / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 105 Atk / 65 Def / 60 SpA / 75 SpD / 130 Spe<br />
Abilities: Rock Head / Pressure / <em>Unnerve</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Once a popular suicide lead in DPP OU, Aerodactyl now finds itself in BW RU. Despite this, Aerodactyl can still effectively perform its former duties in the UU tier. It has an extremely high Speed, outpacing even Azelf, meaning it will always set Stealth Rock up early in the match. Its access to Taunt also helps out in this too, as Aerodactyl can stop other entry hazard leads from setting up. And its 105 Attack means it is never useless outside of simply quick Stealth Rock. However, Aerodactyl is frail, vulnerable to priority, and faces stiff competition in its role from Azelf, who is generally more useful. Despite this, Aerodactyl can still be a useful asset to those in need of a quick Stealth Rock early in the match.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/647.png" alt="Accelgor"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/accelgor/uu">Accelgor</a></strong><br />
Type: Bug<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 70 Atk / 40 Def / 100 SpA / 60 SpD / 145 Spe<br />
Abilities: Hydration / Sticky Hold / <em>Unburden</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes</p>

<p>True to his name, Accelgor is the second fastest Pokemon legal in UU, outpaced only by Ninjask. His quick Speed along with his access to Spikes make him an excellent suicide lead, quickly getting up Spikes before the opponent can react. Accelgor isn't a sitting duck either, as it has a solid 100 Special Attack stat and great moves in Bug Buzz, Focus Blast, and Giga Drain to make good use of it. Accelgor also has Final Gambit to sacrifice itself, denting an opposing spinner while setting up a couple layers of Spikes in the process. Overall, Accelgor is an excellent Pokemon when it comes to Spikes stacking.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/588.png" alt="Crustle"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/crustle/uu">Crustle</a></strong><br />
Type: Bug / Rock<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 95 Atk / 125 Def / 65 SpA / 75 SpD / 45 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sturdy / Shell Armor / <em>Weak Armor</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock, Spikes</p>

<p>Although Crustle might seem outclassed by other hazard users, it has one unique trait that makes it worth using; access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock. This makes Crustle an excellent hazard setter, as it can set up both hazards and is bulky enough to do so. It also has Sturdy, which means even if something hits it too hard, it can still guarantee a layer of hazards. It can be an effective lead with Custap Berry thanks to this. It also has a solid 95 Attack, which, in conjunction with its STABs, allow it to pack a punch, and also allow it to defeat most anti-leads such as Azelf, Sableye, and Xatu.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/627.png" alt="Ferroseed"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/ferroseed/uu">Ferroseed</a></strong><br />
Type: Grass / Steel<br />
Base Stats: 44 HP / 50 Atk / 91 Def / 24 SpA / 86 SpD / 10 Spe<br />
Ability: Iron Barbs<br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock, Spikes</p>

<p>Don't let Ferroseed's small size, low stats, and NFE status drive you away; Ferroseed is a solid choice for a hazard user in UU. Ferroseed has access to Eviolite, giving it solid bulk overall and allowing it to take enough hits to be able to set up Stealth Rock and Spikes. Its typing is another big boon to this, granting it many resistances that allow it to take on plenty of threats, giving it many opportunities to set up hazards. It also has Iron Barbs and Leech Seed to be able to wear down the opponent, while Thunder Wave allows Ferroseed to further support the team. While it has a pitiful Attack stat, Gyro Ball gives it some decent offensive power. Ferroseed is unfortunately slow and its power is sometimes very lacking, but despite this, Ferroseed is still a solid hazard user that can wall and support.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/34.png" alt="Nidoking"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/nidoking">Nidoking</a></strong><br /> 
Type: Poison / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 81 HP / 92 Atk / 77 Def / 85 SpA / 75 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Poison Point / Rivalry / <em>Sheer Force</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/31.png" alt="Nidoqueen"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/nidoqueen">Nidoqueen</a></strong><br />
Type: Poison / Ground<br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 82 Atk / 87 Def / 75 SpA / 85 SpD / 76 Spe<br />
Abilities: Poison Point / Rivalry / <em>Sheer Force</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Two of the pinnacles of wallbreaking, Nidoking and Nidoqueen are some of the best hazard users available in UU. They have an easy time setting up Stealth Rock, mostly because of the number of switches they force. Their incredible power makes them no sitting ducks, putting massive dents in the opposing team, thanks to Sheer Force and Life Orb as well as excellent coverage moves. Nidoking is the faster one of the two, and mostly aims for the raw power, whereas Nidoqueen is bulkier and slower. Their typing is quite ideal defensively as well, giving them useful resistances to take on the common Fighting- and Electric-types in UU, giving them even more chances to set up. The duo also have access to Toxic Spikes to go for residual damage; Nidoqueen especially could go the defensive route and run Toxic Spikes and Dragon Tail, though it is often an inferior choice to Stealth Rock.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/410.png" alt="Roserade"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/roserade">Roserade</a></strong><br />
Type: Grass / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 70 Atk / 55 Def / 125 SpA / 105 SpD / 90 Spe<br />
Abilities: Natural Cure / Poison Point / <em>Technician</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Roserade functions as one of the best Spikes users in UU thanks to its many positive qualities. Aside from its cool appearance, Roserade has a high Special Defense and a typing decent enough to allow it to take on Water-types and Shaymin, giving it numerous opportunities to set up Spikes. Roserade also has access to Natural Cure, which when paired with its typing, makes it a viable weapon against Water-types, and can use them as setup fodder for Spikes. This also makes it the only Spikes user capable of defeating Blastoise, UU's premier spinner, one-on-one. It also beats Claydol, which is another plus in terms of hazard setting. Roserade has useful support moves in Leech Seed, Sleep Powder, and Aromatherapy, allowing it to provide even more support to the team. It even has reliable recovery in either Rest or Synthesis as well, meaning it can stay healthy to repeatedly set up Spikes. To top it off it has an excellent 125 Special Attack, and with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, Roserade can put some real hurt on the opposing team. However, Sleep Powder is illegal with Spikes, which means Roserade will always have to run Toxic Spikes if you want Sleep Powder, although this is still a usable hazard for more defensive teams. Overall, Roserade is always a choice to consider for a Spiker, whether on a defensive team or for those in need of a weapon against bulky Water-types.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/211.png" alt="Qwilfish"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/qwilfish/uu">Qwilfish</a></strong><br />
Type: Water / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 95 Atk / 75 Def / 55 SpA / 55 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Poison Point / Swift Swim / <em>Intimidate</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Like Roserade, Qwilfish is one of UU's best Spikes users. Although his stats scream "mediocrity," Qwilfish has an excellent ability in Intimidate, making his mediocre physical bulk great, while he has an excellent defensive typing to back it up. This makes Qwilfish an excellent check to many of UU's top physical attackers such as Mienshao, Heracross, and Darmanitan. As such, Qwilfish can find multiple opportunities to set up Spikes throughout the match. He has decent recovery in Pain Split, which, aside from dealing decent damage, will be able to keep Qwilfish at enough HP to repeatedly do his job. He can support the team even further as well, with Thunder Wave, Haze, and Taunt being useful supportive options. Alternatively, you could also run Toxic Spikes on Qwilfish, although the popularity of Poison-types such as Roserade, Nidoqueen, and Qwilfish himself make this a lesser option. Qwilfish's many positive qualities make it a choice you must consider when looking for a Spiker in UU.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/573.png" alt="Scolipede"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/scolipede/uu">Scolipede</a></strong><br />
Type: Bug / Poison<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 90 Atk / 89 Def / 55 SpA / 69 SpD / 112 Spe<br />
Abilities: Poison Point / Swarm / <em>Quick Feet</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Spikes, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Although generally overlooked in favor of other Spikers such as Qwilfish, Scolipede is still a solid choice, especially for offensive teams. Scolipede has an excellent 112 Speed, which means he can set up Spikes quickly before the opponent can react. He also poses a solid offensive threat with his decent 90 Attack, and a powerful STAB Megahorn is fairly brutal, while Earthquake and Rock Slide allow him to hurt anything that resists his Megahorn. With a Focus Sash, Scolipede can not only guarantee two layers of Spikes most of the time, but also activates his ability Swarm to power up Megahorn to even more brutal levels, meaning Scolipede can deal extreme damage to the opponent before going down. Despite the competition from Roserade as a fast Spiker, Scolipede still makes an excellent Pokemon for offensive Spike-stacking teams.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/235.png" alt="Smeargle"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/smeargle/uu">Smeargle</a></strong><br />
Type: Normal<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 20 Atk / 35 Def / 20 SpA / 45 SpD / 75 Spe<br />
Abilities: Own Tempo / Technician / <em>Moody</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>At first glance, Smeargle looks like a complete joke; it has laughable stats in all areas and has only one move in Sketch. However, its signature move has granted it the widest movepool in the game, which makes Smeargle unique among the many hazard setters in that it is capable of setting up all three kinds of entry hazards. Smeargle also has access to Spore, which means it can put an opponent to sleep, and proceed to use the free turns to set up many hazards. Alongside a Focus Sash, Smeargle is almost always guaranteed to set up at least two layers of hazards in a match. It has Magic Coat and Whirlwind, meaning it can stop Taunt or prevent itself from being setup fodder. Its low stats, however, do haunt it, as Smeargle has no use outside of setting up entry hazards. However, this is usually enough for Smeargle to leave its mark in the match.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/139.png" alt="Omastar"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/omastar/uu">Omastar</a></strong><br />
Type: Rock / Water<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 60 Atk / 125 Def / 115 SpA / 70 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Abilities: Swift Swim / Shell Armor / <em>Weak Armor</em><br />
Usable entry hazards: Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Omastar is one of the only two Pokemon that can set up all three entry hazards, the other being Smeargle. Unlike Smeargle however, Omastar boasts actual defensive stats as well as a typing with some use defensively. Omastar can take on some common threats such as Darmanitan, Victini, and Snorlax, which alongside its physical bulk, gives it a number of opportunities to set up entry hazards. Omastar also can run a decently powerful Scald coming off of its high Special Attack stat, and its burn chance is excellent in weakening physical attackers, allowing Omastar to give some extra support to the team.</p>

<h2>Preventing Hazards</h2>

<p>Luckily, there are numerous ways to stop entry hazards from being on your field. The following are all great to have on your team to prevent its members from being worn down over time.</p>

<h3>Rapid Spin</h3>

<p>The most popular way to remove entry hazards is the move Rapid Spin. This move is the sole reason some Pokemon, particularly Blastoise and Claydol, see usage in UU, as many of UU's spinners have little use outside of this move. All of the viable spinners in UU have their own advantages that make them worth using.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/9.png" alt="Blastoise"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/blastoise">Blastoise</a></strong><br />
Type: Water<br />
Base Stats: 79 HP / 83 Atk / 100 Def / 85 SpA / 105 SpD / 78 Spe<br />
Abilities: Torrent / <em>Rain Dish</em></p>

<p>A fan favorite from RBY, Blastoise sees usage as UU's best Rapid Spin user. It has a solid Water type, giving it something useful defensively. It also has solid bulk, meaning it can take a number of hits. Blastoise can take on a number of UU's spinblockers with its decently powerful Scald as well as Toxic, preventing them from being safe. It also has Roar to constantly force them out, and rack up entry hazard damage. Its Scald can also weaken physical attackers, which can help out the team pretty decently. Blastoise is also capable of guaranteeing Rapid Spins with Foresight. However, Blastoise lacks recovery, which can sometimes get in its way of repeatedly pulling off Rapid Spin. Also note that if Blastoise is not used for spinning, it is outclassed by the other Water-types available in UU.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/344.png" alt="Claydol"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/claydol">Claydol</a></strong><br />
Type: Ground / Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 70 Atk / 105 Def / 70 SpA / 120 SpD / 75 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Claydol also has membership in UU's Rapid Spin club, and has some useful qualities to let it stand out from the rest. Although Claydol has a number of weaknesses, it also sports excellent resistances, and alongside its good 60 / 105 / 120 defenses, it's able to pull off a Rapid Spin whenever it needs to. One of Claydol's biggest selling points is its excellent ability in Levitate, which makes it indifferent to all three entry hazards, meaning it can repeatedly come in to spin throughout the match. Claydol can support its team well with Stealth Rock and dual screens, making it a decent choice for a supportive Pokemon. It also has Toxic to wear down spinblockers that try to come in, meaning they are not always safe. It can run a gimmicky set with Trick and Ring Target as well, removing incoming Ghost-types' ability to spinblock. However, Claydol's main problem is its nonexistent offensive stats, which make it hard to spin against bulkier Ghost-types.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/645.png" alt="Cryogonal"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/cryonogal/uu">Cryogonal</a></strong><br />
Type: Ice<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 50 Atk / 30 Def / 95 SpA / 135 SpD / 105 Spe<br />
Abilty: Levitate</p>

<p>Cryogonal is a unique Pokemon in UU's group of Rapid Spinners. Like its friend Claydol, Cryogonal also has access to Levitate, meaning it is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes; however, it has a Stealth Rock weakness. That said, it also has an excellent Special Defense, meaning it can take many special hits and pull off a spin in the process. Cryogonal's biggest selling point is its access to reliable recovery in Recover, meaning it can heal itself to pull off multiple Rapid Spins. It can also go the offensive route thanks to its 95 Special Attack, and with Ice Beam and Hidden Power, it can pose a solid offensive threat on its own. It often finds itself a spot on hail teams to remove entry hazards and spam Blizzard on its own. Overall, Cryogonal is a decent choice on certain teams looking for its qualities.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/237.png" alt="Hitmontop"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/hitmontop/uu">Hitmontop</a></strong><br />
Type: Fighting<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 95 Atk / 95 Def / 35 SpA / 110 SpD / 70 Spe<br />
Abilities: Intimidate / Technician / <em>Steadfast</em></p>

<p>Hitmontop has quite a bit going for it in terms of Rapid Spin. It has Intimidate, allowing it to check common physical threats such as Mienshao and Darmanitan. This means Hitmontop can pull off a spin quite often. Its access to Foresight also allows it to spin even against Ghost-types, which makes it quite a solid choice. It also has a decently powerful Close Combat, coming off of its 95 Attack, meaning it is never going to be a complete sitting duck. Overall, Hitmontop may be outclassed by Blastoise at spinning, but it is still a pretty solid choice.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" alt="Kabutops"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/kabutops/uu">Kabutops</a></strong><br />
Type: Rock / Water<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 115 Atk / 105 Def / 65 SpA / 70 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Abilities: Swift Swim / Battle Armor / <em>Weak Armor</em></p>

<p>Kabutops is a solid choice for an offensive spinner thanks to its excellent 115 Attack and access to Swords Dance, making it a powerful offensive threat. Its access to Aqua Jet and Stone Edge allow it to put the hurt on opposing spinblockers, pulling off a Rapid Spin afterwards. Its priority Aqua Jet also comes in handy to pace faster threats such as Mienshao and Cinccino, meaning Kabutops can also revenge kill and sweep, making it more useful. It can also run Stealth Rock to provide decent support to the team.</p>

<h3>Taunt</h3>

<p>Although not as reliable a way to prevent entry hazards as Rapid Spin, Taunt is still a decent way to stop hazards from going down on your side of the field. There a a number of fast Taunt users in UU, all of them being good options for this move.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/302.png" alt="Sableye"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/sableye">Sableye</a></strong><br />
Type: Dark / Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 75 Atk / 75 Def / 65 SpA / 65 SpA / 50 Spe<br />
Abilities: Keen Eye / Stall / <em>Prankster</em></p>

<p>Sableye was once one of the worst Pokemon in the game, but now thanks to its ability Prankster, it packs a priority Taunt, which ensures that it can quickly stop the use of entry hazards. It also has Recover, keeping itself healthy to Taunt entry hazard users multiple times in the match.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/487.png" alt="Azelf"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/azelf">Azelf</a></strong><br />
Type: Psychic<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 125 Atk / 70 Def / 125 SpA / 70 SpD / 115 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Azelf has a fast Taunt, which means he can quickly stop entry hazards unless the opponent has the rare Aerodactyl or Accelgor. He can also set up Stealth Rock himself, and can be a good anti-lead in general thanks to his blistering Speed. He also poses a powerful offensive threat with his high offensive stats, putting dents in the opposing team before going down.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/169.png" alt="Crobat"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/crobat">Crobat</a></strong><br />
Type: Poison / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 85 HP / 90 Atk / 80 Def / 70 SpA / 80 SpD / 130 Spe<br />
Abilities: Inner Focus / <em>Infiltrator</em></p>

<p>Crobat has the fastest Taunt in UU aside from Aerodactyl. It can quickly fire off a Taunt before anything can react and then U-turn to a teammate to deal with the opponent. It has access to Roost to keep itself healthy to be able to repeatedly use Taunt. Overall, Crobat is a great choice to stop entry hazards from being on your side of the field.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/142.png" alt="Aerodactyl"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/aerodactyl/uu">Aerodactyl</a></strong><br />
Type: Rock / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 105 Atk / 65 Def / 60 SpA / 75 SpD / 130 Spe<br />
Abilities: Rock Head / Pressure / <em>Unnerve</em></p>

<p>Like Crobat, Aerodactyl also has the fastest Taunt in UU, meaning it will stop hazards from going up most of the time. It also poses a solid offensive threat thanks to its base 105 Attack, and can run Stone Edge and Earthquake to be able to put dents in the team. It also sets up Stealth Rock on its own, making it a decent choice for a Taunt user. It is, however, often outclassed by Azelf as an anti-lead.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/671.png" alt="Tornadus"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/tornadus">Tornadus</a></strong><br />
Type: Flying<br />
Base Stats: 79 HP / 115 Atk / 70 Def / 125 SpA / 80 SpD / 111 Spe<br />
Abilities: Pranster / <em>Defiant</em></p>

<p>Tornadus has priority Taunt, like Sableye, but it also has great stats, meaning it can be an offensive threat with Hurricane and Superpower, decimating teams on its own while stopping entry hazards. It also has a higher Speed than Sableye, making it less prone to opposing priority. Tornadus can be a very good choice to Taunt entry hazards users overall.</p>

<h3>Magic Bounce</h3>

<p>Magic Bounce is a pretty solid way to stop the use of entry hazards from going onto the field, while also bouncing it back to the opponent, leaving them in a lethal situation. Magic Bounce has limited distribution, but the one user has its uses in UU for the move.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/178.png" alt="Xatu"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/xatu">Xatu</a></strong><br />
Type: Psychic / Flying<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 75 Atk / 70 Def / 95 SpA / 70 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Synchronize / Early Bird / <em>Magic Bounce</em></p>

<p>Xatu is a Pokemon that can block the use of entry hazards, and bounce them back to the opponent, which can be useful to stop Spikes and Stealth Rock from threatening your team. It also can bounce back status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, making it useful to stop paralysis spreading or poison. Xatu also has reliable recovery in Roost, which means it can repeatedly come in to bounce hazards back to the opponent. It can also support its team with Thunder Wave, Light Screen, and Reflect, making it a decent team supporter. It even has U-turn to switch out whenever needed. It pairs up well with a spinner or a Taunt user, such as Sableye, to be sure entry hazards stay off the field.</p>

<h2>Spinblocking</h2>

<p>Rapid Spin has become such a common sight that a strategy has arisen to counter the move; spinblocking. Since Rapid Spin is a damaging Normal-type move, Ghost-types effectively stop the move from working. A number of Ghost-types in UU are effective at spinblocking, and each one has their own qualities that make them worth using as spinblockers.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/593.png" alt="Cofagrigus"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/cofagrigus">Cofagrigus</a></strong><br />
Type: Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 58 HP / 50 Atk / 145 Def / 95 SpA / 105 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Ability: Mummy</p>

<p>Cofagrigus is the premier spinblocker in the UU environment, as it holds many positive qualities that make it wonderful on any team in need. It has a titanic base 145 Defense and a solid base 105 Special Defense, and its typing allows it to take on all of the tier's spinners one-on-one. It has Will-O-Wisp to cripple Pokemon and wear them down, while it packs a decently powerful Shadow Ball to bring the hurt. It also has Mummy to negate common abilities of the spinners. Cofagrigus can also pose a solid offensive threat on its own thanks to Trick Room and Nasty Plot, allowing it to set up and proceed to destroy the opposing spinner with powerful Shadow Balls. It can beat Blastoise and Claydol with relative ease thanks to these qualities. Overall, Cofagrigus is the best spinblocker in the tier.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/302.png" alt="Sableye"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/sableye">Sableye</a></strong><br />
Type: Dark / Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 75 Atk / 75 Def / 65 SpA / 65 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Abilities: Keen Eye / Stall / <em>Prankster</em></p>

<p>Despite its terrible stats, Sableye is an excellent spinblocker in UU thanks to its Dream World ability, Prankster. It can quickly use Taunt to prevent Foresight from Hitmontop and Blastoise, while it has Will-O-Wisp to cripple offensive spinners. It has Recover to keep itself healthy, and its typing grants it no weaknesses, aiding in its ability to stall the opponent. While its bulk leaves a lot to be desired, it's enough to handle the spinblockers. It can constantly be an annoyance to the opposing spinners as many of them are defensively oriented. Although Sableye is fairly limited in what it can do, it still makes for a solid spinblocker.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/356.png" alt="Dusclops"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/dusclops">Dusclops</a></strong><br />
Type: Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 40 HP / 70 Atk / 130 Def / 60 SpA / 130 Def / 25 Spe<br />
Ability: Pressure</p>

<p>Dusclops was a big winner of the fifth generation, as due to its NFE status, it can bolster its already good defenses to formidable levels with Eviolite, making it one of the only Pokemon that cannot be OHKOed by nearly any move. This helps Dusclops in its role as a spinblocker immensely, as it can take many hits from any of the spinners in the tier while crippling them with Will-O-Wisp and Curse. This means it can slowly chip away at their HP combined with entry hazard damage. It can run Pain Split and Rest as decent forms of recovery, keeping it at enough HP to constantly take on spinblockers. Be careful, however, as Dusclops lacks Leftovers recovery, which can sometimes get in its way at performing its spinblocking duties. However, despite this, Dusclops can make for a useful defensive spinblocker.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/434.png" alt="Mismagius"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/mismagius">Mismagius</a></strong><br />
Type: Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 60 Atk / 60 Def / 105 SpA / 105 SpD / 105 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Mismagius is a more offensive spinblocker, which makes it a good fit on the fast offensive teams looking into the use of a fast Ghost-type. Mismagius has access to Thunderbolt, which allows it to deal with the premier spinner, Blastoise. Its Shadow Ball allows it to handle Claydol and Hitmontop as well. Mismagius also has Nasty Plot and Calm Mind, allowing it to boost its Special Attack to become even more threatening to opposing spinners. It can avoid Toxic with Substitute, while it also has access to other moves such as Taunt and Will-O-Wisp. Mismagius is also quite fast, allowing it to move before opposing spinners can react. Mismagius can overall find itself a spot as a more offensive spinblocker compared to the other Ghost-types.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/639.png" alt="Chandelure"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/chandelure">Chandelure</a></strong><br />
Type: Ghost / Fire<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 55 Atk / 90 Def / 145 SpA / 90 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Abilities: Flash Fire / Flame Body</p>

<p>Chandelure is not that great of a spinblocker on its own, mostly due to being weak to Blastoise's Scald and Claydol's Earthquake. This makes it advisable to pair Chandelure up with another spinblocker to make full use of spinblocking. That said, Chandelure can come in and use its extreme Special Attack to scorch opposing spinners with Fire Blast and Shadow Ball. It can also run Substitute to avoid a stray Toxic, while running Pain Split is usable to heal itself and deal damage. Chandelure can also run a Choice Specs set to make its damage more brutal. Outside of that, Chandelure is limited to mostly being an offensive spinblocker, as its defensive capabilities are lacking.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/484.png" alt="Rotom"><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/rotom/uu">Rotom</a></strong><br />
Type: Electric / Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 50 Atk / 77 Def / 95 SpA / 77 SpD / 91 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Rotom is a rather unique choice for a spinblocker. Its main selling point is its Electric STAB; which means it can deal with Blastoise fairly easily, and it also takes on Claydol rather well. The other unique thing about Rotom is its access to Volt Switch, which means it can grab momentum as opposing spinners switch out of the match. It has a solid Special Attack and a decent Speed to deal some strong and fast damage, which makes it decent on offensive teams. Although it may not seem like it, Rotom is also capable of going on the defensive despite its low defenses, as it has some excellent resistances, and can take a number of hits from opposing spinners and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Overall, Rotom is a very unique choice for a spinblocker.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/653.png" alt="Golurk">><br />
<strong><a href="/bw/pokemon/golurk/uu">Golurk</a></strong><br />
Type: Ground / Ghost<br />
Base Stats: 89 HP / 124 Atk / 80 Def / 55 SpA / 80 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Abilities: Klutz / Iron Fist / <em>No Guard</em></p>

<p>Golurk is also capable of spinblocking and setting up hazards at the same time. It can set up Stealth Rock to support its team, and has decent bulk to take on opposing spinners. It has a high 124 Attack and a STAB Earthquake to deal heavy damage to Blastoise and Hitmontop, while its STAB Shadow Punch also puts the hurt on Claydol. This makes Golurk a pretty solid choice to set up Stealth Rock and spinblock at the same time. Golurk could also run No Guard along with DynamicPunch to annoy opposing spinners with confusion, although this is rather gimmicky.</p>

<h2>Phazing</h2>

<p>Phazing, short for "pseudo-Hazing," is a common way to take advantage of hazards. This is done by the moves Roar, Whirlwind, Dragon Tail, and Circle Throw, which can force the Pokemon out of the field, racking up entry hazard damage. Common defensive Pokemon such as Snorlax, Blastoise, Empoleon, and Slowking often run these moves in their sets. One of the most well-known examples of phazers is Prankster Riolu, being able to use priority Roar thanks to its access to Copycat, and Prankster gives the move +1 priority.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Like in any tier, entry hazards are a dominant force in UU, and hopefully you now have an understanding of entry hazards, including the viable users, ways to counter them, and how to make use of them. When making a team, be sure to fit at least one kind of hazard onto your team; they are vital to victory. Always be sure to pack a spinblocker as well, as maintaining the entry hazards can make a big difference in the match. Always pack something that can take advantage of entry hazards, whether by phazing or just sweeping teams outright. And since hazards are so important, make sure that that Blastoise or Claydol of yours stays alive throughout the match; if they go down before they spin, you can be in trouble. There is always a risk to entry hazards, so plan carefully for them.</p>
