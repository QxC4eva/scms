Overview
########

- Very strong Bullet Punch picks off a lot of more frail offensive Pokemon like Skymin, Latios, Deo-A
- Hits Fairies (Aromatisse, Togekiss) and Psychics (Reuniclus, Slowking, Cresselia) for SE STAB, so it's pretty good anti-TR.
- Great bulk when Mega Evolved makes it a better Swords Dance user than last generation
- Can switch in on Dragons even better than before, but dragons are less common
- Very bad neutral coverage
- Setup fodder for Heatran, Thundurus, and Charizard
- Exploitable 4x fire weakness (Hidden Power)

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move1: Swords Dance
move2: Bullet Punch
move3: Bug Bite
move4: Protect
ability: Technician
item: Scizorite / Lum Berry
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Swords Dance is amazing because it overrides Scizor's worst enemy: Intimidate. Landorus-T thinks it's cute switching in, letting Scizor get a free +1
- Bullet Punch and Bug Bite provide priority and power respectively, and hit some of the best behemoths in the tier (Cresselia, Terrakion) for Super Effective
- Protect because it's Protect
- Superpower can be run in the last slot; Superpower greatly improves coverage, problem being if you drop protect you're asking to get wasted by Fire-type moves

Set Details
========
- Trying to maximize damage output, since that's basically what Scizor is there for, and has no real use for Speed investment so HP.
- Occa Berry with 204 SpD lives Hydreigon's Fire Blast, but greatly reduces Scizor's power (and wastes its item) to do so
- Scizorite greatly increases Scizor's bulk and slightly increases his power and Speed so it is the best option for a setup Pokemon--use it unless you have another mega on your team.
- If you already have another Mega, you should run Lum Berry, as Scizor is a common Will-o-Wisp target.
- If running Mega Scizor, 92 Speed is an option so you beat min Cresselia and Rotom-W, which should make you less dependent on team support to outplay their Will-o-Wisp/Hidden Power Fire

Usage Tips
========
- Scizor hardly needs to set up a Swords Dance every time it comes in--his STABs are plenty strong at +0, just use offensive moves until you suspect you'll have a free turn.
- Counteracting the above point, it's wise to SD if you suspect an intimidate is coming your way, because they're not plenty strong at -1
- Be wary of giving free turns to certain Pokemon that don't care about Scizor's STAB--Thundurus, Heatran, Charizard are the big three.
- Remove Fire-types before Swords Dancing or it's a wasted turn usually
- Know common Hidden Power Fire users (Latios, Shaymin-S, Cresselia) and if you suspect the opponent's team has Scizor troubles, scout for it so that you avoid heartbreak.
- It's best to give Scizor free switches as much as possible; save the hard switch-ins for when he really needs to tank a hit for a teammate.
- Generally the two biggest team support things are contradictory--you want grasses for Rotom-W yet you want things that don't lose to Fire-types. It's a struggle to juggle, do your best.

Team Options
========
- Obviously Pokemon that beat Fire-types handily--Garchomp, Tyranitar, Politoed, and more can not only scare Fire-types from switching into Scizor but clean up the mess if Scizor does give the Fire-types a free turn.
- Shaymin-Sky can remove Rotom-W and Gourgeist, the most common Will-o-Wisp users, while still carrying Earth Power and Air Slash to not be setup fodder for Heatran / Charizard Y respectively
- Can work well on semi-Trick Room which has problems with Pokemon like Cresselia that run Trick Room specifically to undo it; full Trick Room is better off with Escavalier usually
- Very good on teams lacking in speed control; has Bullet Punch for faster Pokemon, but also Bug Bite and Bullet Punch to beat common Trick Room setters/abusers
- Follow Me saves Scizor from Will-o-Wisps but has a couple problems with Fire-Types: for one, none of the Follow Me users can touch them, and for two, Heat Wave is a spread move.
- Ruins Fairy-types so Pokemon that don't like Fairies enjoy his presence (especially ones who don't like Togekiss's Follow Me support, like Conkeldurr and Hydreigon)

Utility
########
name: Utility
move1: Bug Bite
move2: Bullet Punch
move3: Protect
move4: Feint / Superpower
ability: Technician
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Bullet Punch and Bug Bite provide priority and power respectively, and hit some of the best behemoths in the tier for Super Effective
- Protect because it's protect
- Feint is a great move for offensive teams as it allows them to maintain momentum when the opponent tries to regain it through a protect; amazing finisher against low-HP Pokemon.
- Superpower is for if your team doesn't make use of feint; patches the biggest hole in its coverage which is Steel-types

Set Details
========
- A set that almost exclusively uses priority doesn't have much need for Speed
- Scizorite is still best item, but this Scizor is less reliant on its bulk, so it's only a good idea if there are absolutely no other Mega Pokemon that would take priority over Mega Scizor
- Power is maximized so it can do as much damage as possible
- Life Orb gives even more power while retaining the ability to switch moves
- Lum Berry keeps that extra 10% health each turn and protects against burns, but the power drop is noticeable (since you have bug bite you should hopefully be able to keep Scizor on life support even when Life Orb by stealing Sitrus Berries)
- If superpower, it might be tempting to EV speed for minimum Heatran, but since all Heatran run speed creep it's just going to end in heartbreak

Usage Tips
========
- Doesn't OHKO much of anything, is better for just finishing the job
- Fortunately a lot of this guy's usefulness doesn't come from his raw power; even at -1 and burned he can still break protects and chip in that last 5% and steal Sitrus Berries
- However it is best to double switch out of Intimidates and avoid burns
- Try to avoid being switch fodder for Fire- and Steel-types by staying on your toes and playing Scizor as a hit-and-run or only partnering him with Pokemon that beat those things

Team Options
========
- More than anything else, Trick Room appreciates Feint support, and Scizor is slow enough to function in it; just make sure you drop IVs to 0 Spe
- Things that can cover Scizor's Fire-type weakness--Garchomp, Zygarde, Tyranitar, Politoed
- As above, teams that lack speed control

Other Options
########

- Occa berry sounds fun but Scizor would still die to most Fire-type moves lol
- Aerial Ace can be used to hit Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Hitmontop
- Roost would be nice but Mega Scizor cannot sacrifice a moveslot to run it
- Tailwind
- Knock Off
- Quick Guard
- Light Screen
- U-turn

Checks and Counters
########
 
- Fire-types (Talonflame, Heatran, Charizard Y, Volcarona, Rotom-H) don't fear its STAB and threaten a KO
- Steel-types / Thundurus don't fear its STAB; can't do as much directly back but can set up / troll Scizor's partner
- Intimidate beats non-Swords Dance Scizor, but switching to an Intimidator just gives SDzor a free turn
- Will-o-Wisp but beware of Lum
- Scizor's not THAT bulky so he'll usually fall to a few strong neutral hits
- Bulkier pokemon that can do decent damage or burn it (Water-types often)
