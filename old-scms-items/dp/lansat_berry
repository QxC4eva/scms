<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the user's HP falls to 25% or less and Focus Energy is not in effect for the user, it activates Focus Energy for the user, raising the holder's critical hit rate two stages. One-time use.</p>

<p>Provides a one-time 80 Base Power Flying-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Lansat Berry is another member of the "pinch Berry" family, which raises the holder's critical hit ratio by +2 when at 25% or less of its total HP. On paper, this sounds like a good idea, but it is often much better to outright attack with a boosting item than attempt to reach the point of Lansat Berry's activation. Furthermore, sweeping at 25% health is very risky.</p>

<p>However, one must not overlook the abilities Sniper and Gluttony. Sniper makes all critical hits do three times the normal damage when they land. This allows Kingdra and Octillery to hit incredibly hard with their powerful STAB moves. On the other hand, Linoone has the ability Gluttony, which will activate Lansat Berry when Linoone reaches 50% of its HP. This has tremendous synergy with Belly Drum, allowing Linoone to sweep with its incredibly powerful STAB ExtremeSpeed.</p>

<p>However, Kingdra usually appreciates a Chesto Berry or an attack boosting item, and would rather use Swift Swim in most cases. Octillery, on the other hand, appreciates the constant recovery from Leftovers, and its Suction Cups ability allows it to retain stat boosts gained from Baton Pass. Linoone needs all the Speed it can get when it is not using ExtremeSpeed, making Salac Berry the superior option.</p>
