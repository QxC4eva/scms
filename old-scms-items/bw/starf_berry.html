[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder's HP hits or falls below 25%, this Berry will raise one of the holder's stats at random by two stages. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes an 80 Base Power Psychic-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Definitely the best-looking Berry, bar none. However, it's not the best in competitive battles, unfortunately. A free two-stage boost is definitely nice, if of course it is in the stat you wanted it to be in. Speed, evasion, or your preferred attacking stat are always niceâ€”but then it always depends on the situation, meaning that on average, you are unlikely to get the boosts you need even half of the time. Alas, the rainbow Berry simply pales in comparison to more conventional boosting items.</p>
