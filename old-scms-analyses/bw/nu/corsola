[Overview]

<p>A Game Freak experiment gone wrong, Corsola is an atrocious Pokemon in NU. In fact, Corsola's mediocre defensive stats and poor defensive typing leave it vulnerable to nearly every common offensive Pokemon in the tier&mdash;it's baffling why anyone would ever use it! However, despite Corsola's many drawbacks, access to Regenerator, Stealth Rock, and a 4x resistance to Fire-type attacks are just enough to carve a small niche for it. And besides, it's just so cute!</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is one of the best sets that Corsola can run, abusing its marvelous ability alongside acceptable bulk to try to use Stealth Rock before fainting. Recover allows Corsola to heal back HP from any attack that fails to OHKO it&mdash;usually Normal- and Fire-type attacks. Scald is the best option for Corsola to do damage, as it has a 30% chance to burn the opponent, making it easier for Corsola to check physical attackers. Power Gem can also be used if you have difficulties with Flying-types, particularly Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, which this set is a hard counter to. Toxic is used in the last slot to cripple Pokemon that it cannot harm at all, such as Alomomola, Exeggutor, and Tangela.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Corsola's typing is better suited for tanking physical attacks, but a specially defensive EV spread can be used decently. Even fully invested, Corsola is quite frail and should not be used to tank many attacks, as it lacks the sheer bulk needed to do so. Essentially, Corsola should only be taking Normal-, Flying-, and Fire-type attacks, as any other will likely KO it. Tangela can form a Regenerator core with Corsola and take Fighting-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks for it, whilst Corsola can take Fire- and Flying-type attacks for Tangela. Most sweepers appreciate the Stealth Rock that Corsola provides, so Corsola on an offensive team isn't unheard of. Bulk Up Braviary really appreciates the Stealth Rock support and also enjoys the status that Corsola can spread, making it easier to set up. Musharna can also set up Calm Mind much easier if the opposition is poisoned, as they can not boost alongside it.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>For such a terrible Pokemon, Corsola has a movepool that stretches to the depths of the ocean. A Choice Band set utilizing Hustle and Head Smash is ridiculously powerful, OHKOing a good portion of the tier, but is not accurate enough to be a true threat. Rocky Helmet allows Corsola to check physical threats better, but the lack of Leftovers recovery makes a huge difference on something as frail as Corsola. Corsola can boost its defenses with Amnesia or Barrier, but that is not recommended as it will likely be OHKOed while trying to set up and Corsola simply doesn't have room for the two moves. Corsola can spread paralysis with Body Slam, but it is pathetically weak. Corsola can boost with Calm Mind, but will need three or four boosts before it becomes relevant. Corsola can confuse the opposition with Confuse Ray, but all that does is give the opponent a 50% chance to OHKO Corsola. Corsola can use Curse, boosting its physical stats, but needs many boosts before becoming a threat and its weakness to many common threats in the tier makes it difficult to set up. The powers of the earth are not unknown to this piece of coral, as it can summon its power or cause quakes, but both are still very weak coming from Corsola. A set using Focus Sash and Endeavor can cripple at least one Pokemon in a match, more than you can expect with any other set. Corsola can also use Ingrain to heal a bit of HP each turn; it will never be enough though. Magic Coat is usable to reflect Stealth Rock or Spikes from something that is going to set up, but it is very risky. Corsola can use Mirror Coat to reflect any special attack that it lives; however, those are quite rare. Dual screens are also an option, but do you really think Corsola could ever set both up? If you're looking for an incredibly weak sweeper, try Rock Polish Corsola, it will never accomplish anything! Corsola also has some interesting offensive options, such as Shadow Ball, Stone Edge, Sucker Punch, Surf, and Explosion. None of these will ever do much damage, since they come from a piece of coral.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Countering Corsola isn't hard at all. Any Pokemon not locked into a Fire-type move can probably win. Gurdurr can switch in, Bulk Up, and doesn't fear status at all, making it the best counter. Other Fighting-types, such as Sawk and Combusken, can also OHKO Corsola with ease. Golurk can tank a Scald and OHKO with Earthquake. Ludicolo and Mantine can both set up on Corsola and attack with Giga Drain and Hydro Pump, respectively. Gorebyss can use Corsola to set up multiple Shell Smashes, allowing it to sweep with ease. Zangoose can take out Corsola with Close Combat, or use it to boost if it is running Swords Dance. Psychic-types, such as Musharna and Duosion, can also set up on Corsola and proceed to sweep the other team. Spikes users, such as Garbodor and Cacturne, fear nothing from Corsola and can set up all day. Truly, anything with a boosting move can defeat Corsola. If you aren't mono-attacking Flareon, you will likely defeat it.</p>
