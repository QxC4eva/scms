[SHORT DESC]
Boosts the user's Defense and Special Defense by 1 stage. Sets the user up to use Spit Up or Swallow.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the Defense and Special Defense of the user by one stage each, and sets the user up to use Spit Up and Swallow. Fails if the user's Stockpile count is three. When Spit Up or Swallow are used, the user loses its boosts and the Stockpile counter is reset.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Stockpile occasionally sees use on Hippowdon, who can boost its excellent Defense and mediocre Special Defense which, when combined with its fantastic HP stat and instant recovery with Slack Off, make it quite bulky. However, unlike Curse, it can only be used up to three times. Still, three boosts is usually enough to make Hippowdon a nearly unbreakable wall.</p>
