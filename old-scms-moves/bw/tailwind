Doubles Speed of the user's party for 4 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For four turns after this move is used, all Pokemon on the user's team have their Speed stat doubled. This does not change the turn order on the turn it is used in. Fails if this move is already in effect for the user's side.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Though not very practical in singles, Tailwind is a phenomenal attack in doubles. Tailwind's boost to your Pokemon's Speed for a few turns can lead to swift and painful deaths for your opponent's Pokemon. Unlike with Trick Room, where you usually need to dedicate all of your team to taking advantage of it, any team can pick up a Tailwind user for a convenient Speed boost. Good Tailwind inducers include the omnipresent Zapdos, who can forgo Heat Wave, Hidden Power, or Protect to support the team. If you're interested in a more dedicated Tailwind user, Whimsicott and Tornadus can work, as with Prankster, they will almost always manage to set up Tailwind.</p>
