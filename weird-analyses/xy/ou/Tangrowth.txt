Overview
########
- Regenerator and great mixed bulk makes it a formidable wall and checks a ton of Pokemon.
- Good attacking stats and movepool.
- Slow, which makes it easy to revenge kill and switch in on in general.
- Competition with the best defensive Pokemon, Mega Venusaur.
- Set up bait for some very dangerous Pokemon.
- Although it's a good switch-in to Water-types, it uses a lot of physical moves, so burn semi-cripples it.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Leaf Storm / Giga Drain
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Fire / Rock Slide
ability: Regenerator
item: Assault Vest
nature: Sassy
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD

Moves
========
- Giga Drain heals and gets STAB
- Leaf Storm always OHKOes max HP Rotom-W, Mega Gyarados, and 4 HP Manaphy after SR, while Giga Drain provides better staying power.
- Knock Off cripples anything that is not a MEvo and provides important coverage against Gengar, Alakazam, Latias, Latios, and Trevenant.
- Eartquake is your best against Aegislash, Excadrill, Mega Charizard-X, Lucario, Klefki, Mega Mawile, Heatran, and Tyranitar, all Pokemon that like to switch into Tangrowth or that Tangrowth checks.
- Hidden Power Ice covers Gliscor, Landorus, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Dragonite, Zygarde, and Breloom, all Pokemon that Tangrowth checks.
- On the other hand Hidden Power Fire deals with Pokemon that like to switch into Tangrowth, such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Genesect.
- Lastly, Rock Slide covers Thundurus, Thundurus-T, Kyurem-B, Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard Y, so it's another great option, though having three physical moves is not recommended unless you have another switch-in to Rotom-W (Tangrowth will be often burned if it's your main switch to Rotom-W).
- Focus Blast can be used over Earthquake, but has crappy accuracy and doesn't deal that good damage to Heatran switch-ins.
- Going all physical with Power Whip is an option, but one of the main reasons to use Assault Vest Tangrowth is to counter Rotom-W, which means that Tangrowth will be often burned. If, for some reason, you have another Pokemon to handle Rotom-W and you are still using Tangrowth, Power Whip is a good option.

Set Details
========
- The EVs and item make Tangrowth an excellent special tank and pivot.
- If you go all physical, use a Careful nature.

Usage Tips
========
- This set is a great mixed tank, able to check a multitude of dangerous offensive Pokemon, such as Excadrill, Mega Lucario, Aegislash, Dragonite, Landorus, Thundurus, Garchomp, Gyarados, Greninja, Tyranitar, and Azumarill. For this reason, it's a good pivot on offensive teams, as a catch-all check to strong sweepers.
- Switch out a lot, it has Regenerator. This is very important if the opponent has a Mega Evolution that can switch into Tangrowth with little trouble, such as Mega Charizard Y or Mega Pinsir, as they are immune to Knock Off and very difficult to contain. As long as those Pokemon are on the field, you should better double switch a lot.
- Use Knock Off only if it's really the best move against the expected switch-in; for example if you are almost sure that the opponent is going to bring Landorus-T in, there is no reason to go for Knock Off when you could just have used Hidden Power Ice. Similarly, refrain from spamming Knock Off when there are Mega Evolutions. that wall Tangrowth on the opposing team.

Team Options
========
- Rotom-W has great synergy with Tangrowth, covering its Fire, Ice, and Flying weaknesses.
- Something to deal with Steel and Grass-types is good, as while Tangrowth is not helpless against most of them, it doesn't like dealing with them either. Heatran works, as does Talonflame.
- Anti-hazard support is nice, so that Tangrowth doesn't have to worry about defensive Steel-types taking advantage of him and can freely use better coverage options (Hidden Power Ice / Rock Slide).
- Slowbro has good synergy with Tangrowth and has Regenerator too, making for a potent pivoting duo that can switch in and out at will.

Knock it Off, Mojonbo Rules Here! (Standard Tank) 
########
name: Knock it Off, Mojonbo Rules Here!
move 1: Giga Drain / Leaf Storm
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Sleep Powder / Earthquake
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Fire
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
nature: Relaxed
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

Moves
========
- Giga Drain for good STAB and recovery.
- Leaf Storm OHKOes Rotom-W and M-Gyarados after Stealth Rock, and fits well with Tangrowth's hit and run playstyle.
- Knock Off is good vs Swords Dance Aegislash, and helps beat Trevenant and Gourgeist, making Sleep Powder easier to use. It's in general Tangrowth's best move to spam early-game.
- Sleep Powder cripples the physical sweepers you want to check, or one of your checks/counters on the switch. Don't use it if there are Grass-types and Mandibuzz on the opposing team unless you know they won't switch in.
- Earthquake covers Excadrill, Lucario, Heatran, Mega Charizard X, Klefki, Mega Mawile, and Bisharp.
- Hidden Power Ice for Lando-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, Dragonite, aka physical attackers that Tangrowth checks. Hidden Power Fire is for Genesect, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Skarmory, but those Pokemon are easier to handle than the threats that Hidden Power Ice covers, and Tangrowth is not supposed to check most of them anyway.
- Power Whip if you have another check to Rotom-W.
- Leech Seed if you want to troll the opponent and lets Tangrowth stick around a bit longer.

Set Details
========
- Max physical bulk to deal with physical attackers.

Usage Tips
========
- Physical wall that can fit in all kind of teams, except from stall, where it offers little team support.
- Don't spam Knock Off if you suspect the opponent has a Mega Evolution that can switch easily into Tangrowth.
- Don't use Sleep Powder when Grass-types / Mandibuzz are alive/healthy, try to weaken them with Hidden Power or double switches + Stealth Rock up.
- Switch out A LOT.

Team Options
========
- Rotom-W has great synergy with Tangrowth, covering its Fire, Ice, and Flying weaknesses.
- Something to deal with Steel and Grass-types is good, as while Tangrowth is not helpless against most of them, it doesn't like dealing with them either. Heatran works, as does Talonflame.
- Assault Vest Slowking checks many special attackers that Tangrowth has problem against, and forms a nice Regenerator core.
- Just covers its weaknesses, Tangrwoth doesn't need much support aside from this, as he is a glue Pokemon.

Other Options
########
- Chlorophyll set for sun teams
- Stun Spore
- Infestation

Checks & Counters
########
- Mega Venusaur is immune to Sleep Powder, is largely unaffected by Knock Off and any of Tangrowth's other moves, and threatens to KO with Sludge Bomb.
- Steel-types that don't care about Earthquake if Tangrowth lacks Hidden Power Fire can just switch in and cause problems.
- Mega Charizard Y, Mega Charizard X, Mega Pinsir, Heatran, and Talonflame can all switch in extremely easily and set up and threaten Tangrowth to switch out.
- Skarmory, Scizor, and Ferrothorn can switch in if Tangrowth lacks Hidden Power Fire and set up.
- Kyurem-B resists Tangrowth's Grass moves and easily sets up a Substitute, as well as threatens to KO with a STAB Ice Beam.
- Tornadus-T and Togekiss rip through Tangrowth with their special Flying STAB.
- Defensive Pokemon that can outstall it or muscle through it eventually, such as Toxic Blissey, Calm Mind Cleable, and SubToxic Gliscor (if Tangrowth lacks Hidden Power Ice).
