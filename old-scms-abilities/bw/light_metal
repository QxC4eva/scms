<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder's weight is halved. This decreases the power of the wielder's <a href="/bw/moves/heat_crash">Heat Crash</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/heavy_slam">Heavy Slam</a>, increases damage taken from an opponent's Heat Crash and Heavy Slam, and reduces damage taken from an opponent's <a href="/bw/moves/grass_knot">Grass Knot</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/low_kick">Low Kick</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/scizor">Scizor</a> values <a href="/bw/abilities/technician">Technician</a> <a href="/bw/moves/bullte_punch">Bullet Punch</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/pursuit">Pursuit</a> too much to opt for Light Metal. <a href="/bw/pokemon/metagross">Metagross</a> is more likely to be hit by <a href="/bw/abilities/intimidate">Intimidate</a> than by Low Kick or Heat Crash, making <a href="/bw/abilities/clear_body">Clear Body</a> the superior option. Metagross would not take less damage from any of the attacks either. In UU, where Low Kick is more prevalent and stat-lowering effects are less common, Light Metal actually becomes a viable option for <a href="/bw/pokemon/registeel">Registeel</a>.</p>
