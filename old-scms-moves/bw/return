Does more damage the happier the user is.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The move's Base Power is dependent upon the user's current happiness. The calculation for Base Power is as follows:</p>

<p>Base Power = Happiness / 2.5, rounded down, or 1.</p>

<p>The Base Power can be anywhere between 0 and 102. On simulators that do not factor in happiness, it is always assumed as 102.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Return is indubitably Game Freak's greatest gift to Normal-types; its massive 102 Base Power and lack of drawbacks makes it a widely popular choice for Normal-type physical attackers such as Snorlax and Staraptor. Return is also used by a few non-Normal Pokemon with shallow movepools, such as Kingler in NU. The biggest problem with Return, though, is that there are quite a few Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-type Pokemon that can safely switch into it. Thus, Return is an uncommon move in OU, which is overstocked with these three types. One way to overcome this weakness is to use coverage moves along with Return. An offensive Snorlax set in UU, for example, always runs Earthquake and Pursuit to deal with threats such as Rhyperior and Mismagius.</p>
