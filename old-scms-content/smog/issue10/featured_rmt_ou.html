<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the team I created back when Salamence was starting to get more recognition as a suspect. Being extremely liquid minded when it comes to OU, I had to adapt to common metagame trends so I couldn't resort to my gimmicks like I do in UU. With that said, I used the famous Salamence to muscle my way through most of my wins. Needless to say, Salamence has been quite the member of my team and it is probably responsible to 100% of my wins.</p>

<h2>Synergy</h2>

<p>Before we get to synergy, this team was not built solely on Salamence, but it was instead built with Machamp. Back when I made this team, Machamp was extremely rare and I derived the idea from a great  player named panamaxis. Only a couple of people really knew about Machamp, and this allowed me to rack up some wins in the ladder and  several tour matches. No one really prepared for Machamp. Between  Machamp + Salamence, I use these two to dent most defensive cores that might trouble my main sweeper, which is Suicune. I had two slots in my team left, so I followed Marriland's heart and went for a simple SkarmBliss core. I topped off my team with a simple Rotom-H to combat with many offensive threats. With that, I created one of the best teams I have ever made!</p>

Machamp @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: No Guard<br />
EVs: 240 HP / 248 Atk / 6 Spe / 16 SpD<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- DynamicPunch<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Payback<br />
- Bullet Punch</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>As previously mentioned, this one had a spot for my team back when it wasn't popular yet. I got the idea from panamaxis, so I thought I might use it as well. This lead literally pumps up the momentum of my team; if it loses at the start of the match, the chances of me winning is now slimmer. Thankfully, not many leads can defeat it but as of late  people are adjusting to the awesomeness of Machamp. I'm looking at Overheat Heatran and ColburZelf particularly. This is key to start my matches as it fishes out at least three members of the opponent's team due to the feat of confusion hax. It allows me to see the entire team at a hindsight and how I could play around those threats to let Suicune sweep.</p>

<p>DynamicPunch is easily the crux of this set as it rightfully defeats bulky leads such as Forretress, Swampert, and Skarmory. This is important for my team because Stealth Rock must not be set and it ultimately allows Salamence to switch in many times in the match without  taking 25% of its health. Payback deals with Rotom mostly; I stay in 100% of the time to damage it because this will help CM Suicune sweep later in the match. Ice Punch deals with Dragonite and Roserade leads. Bullet Punch rounds off the set beautifully as it finishes off sash users like Aerodactly, Azelf, Roserade, and Smeargle. Lum Berry is needed to destroy Sleep users.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/227.png" alt="Skarmory" /><br />
Skarmory @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 36 Spe / 220 SpD<br />
Careful nature (+SpD, -SpA)<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Roost<br />
- Whirlwind</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Part of my famous Marriland core: SkarmBliss! Back when I made this team, Latias was still in the tier and I needed a Steel-type who can take advantage of free turns to set up Spikes. Spikes plays an integral part to my team's success; it places many defensive Pokemon in a tight situation when switching into Salamence. If you're a grounded Steel-type, prepare to be pounded by Draco Meteor.</p>

<p>Taunt is very convenient to this set as it allows me to maintain my momentum to my team, ultimately being up to par with enemy stall teams. Taunt shuts down many Pokemon including Blissey, Skarmory, Forretress, and even Suicune. Whirlwind allows me to phaze away CM Suicune and other CM threats, Flygon, and Mamoswine to name a few. The key idea here is to keep scouting and racking up residual damage. Once every team member is revealed, the planning can commence and I can visualize my CM Suicune sweep lategame. Roost is obviously needed to heal off damage. Careful nature + 36 Speed EVs ensure I outpace enemy Skarmory who invest 20 Spe EVs -- pretty much "counter teaming". Careful allows me to stay in on the likes of HP Fire Shaymin, Latias with Surf, to name a few.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/242.png" alt="Blissey" /><br />
Blissey @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 6 SpD<br />
Bold nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Softboiled<br />
- Thunder Wave</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>The final core of the famous Marriland core: SkarmBliss! Often regarded as bitch, hoe, fat slut, to name a few personas, Blissey will always has a place on my team and it has always been my favourite defensive pivot. Many people questioned Blissey's position on a semi-fast paced team like this -- mostly YTP questioned it, but it does have some key points to my teams success. First and foremost, I needed a Latias check because it literally curbstomps my entire team without it. I did not want to use Tyranitar or Scizor because they lacked something  Blissey has: reliable recovery. This is also my defensive backbone against specially based threats such as Jolteon and Starmie, who would otherwise destroy my team.</p>

<p>Thunder Wave has been the least desired move as a status move, but I personally enjoy the little hax to overcome my wins. Sounds a bit fiendish, but it wins me games. Outside of hax, paralyzing physical offensive threats like Tyranitar, Salamence, Gyarados is always an added bonus. Thunder Wave is also needed for me to defeat the famous SugaRachi (Calm Mind + Wish variant). Without it, it can field on my team any second and I need it paralyzed to stun it several time and place it on a tight situation. Stealth Rock is obviously important and  setting it up is probably the easier considering the amount of free turns Blissey gets. Seismic Toss is probably the most consistent attack move Blissey will ever use, I did go to Ice Beam at one point but I lacked the ability to check offensive Suicune without Rest. Believe it or not, this is the best EV spread you can use on Blissey; it survives stuff like Outrage from Salamence.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/503.png" alt="Rotom-W" /><br />
Rotom-W @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 228 HP / 252 Spe / SpA<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Trick<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Hydro Pump</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Rotom-W is probably the definition of defensive backbone of my team in terms of checking many dangerous threats like Crocune, SD Lucario, SD Scizor, DD Gyarados, to name a few. It is primarily my main glue for offensive threats with a DD boosting move. Rotom provides good typing to switch into many moves and a Choice Scarf seems fitting to this set to help it overcome many quick threats. The EV spread was the key to this set: 28 Special Attack EVs was all I needed to 2HKO offensive Latias, the surplus is sent to the HP department to help it switch into stuff like Gyarados and Lucario more recklessly.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball are obviously givens to this set and it can deal good damage to stuff like Lucario even with the lack of investment. Thanks to Spikes though, I won't need that much Special Attack EVs to OHKO Lucario. Hydro Pump was probably my latest addition to this team due to the sudden increase of Choice Scarf Tyranitar. If I need to, I would use Hydro Pump on a weakened Lucario to avoid having an easy trap for Scarf Tyranitar; it was too prevalent to ignore the usefulness of ScarfTar so Hydro Pump was obviously a change I needed to use.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/373.png" alt="Salamence" /><br />
Salamence @ Life Orb <br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 6 Atk / 252 Spe / 252 SpA<br />
Naive nature (+Spe, -SpD)<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Roost<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>The self-proclaimed stall breaker itself makes a place to my team. I would say that this is the star of my team due to its ability to support my CM Suicune sweep. While the star of my team typically goes to the main sweeper, Salamence steals the spotlight with its destructive ability to rip apart new assholes on all types of teams. Salamence is a walking bag of destruction. Equipped with a high Speed, infectious unpredictability, and an arsenal of three moves that provide unresisted coverage; the powerful stall breaker will not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Between Draco Meteor, Flamethrower, and Earthquake, it only takes a simple toddler to choose which move to use. Skarmory? I'd use Draco Meteor only finding the opponents in the tighter situation after they switch in someone like Swampert or Vaporeon. Prediction cannot  become easier than this. You add Roost to the mix to heal off SR damage and Sandstorm and the fact that Salamence forces so many switches, this bad boy is simply not going down without a fight. Salamence has been a blessing to use offensively. Defensively, it can provide to be useful by checking stuff like SD Lucario when needed or even Gyarados. Have fun in the Uber tier Salamence!</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/245.png" alt="Suicune" /><br />
Suicune @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 6 Def / 252 Spe / 252 SpA<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Hidden Power [Electric]<br />
- Hydro Pump</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>My primary sweeper and usually whipped out later in the match! Once everything has been fully scouted and I have seen everything from a hindsight. I can plan on setting up Calm Mind and literally sweep with this thing. Not many can stand its ability to destroy stuff for hard damage, while having the ability to sustain a sufficient amount of  bulkiness thanks to Calm Mind. Priority will not work on the physical defensive juggernaut like Suicune. This is why Suicune makes the best  lategame sweeper in the game, in my opinion! With all the soft checks  severely weakened and possibly fainted (Vaporeon, Blissey, Rotom, and Latias) thanks to my entire team support, the sweep can commence.</p>

<p>Calm Minding should be an easy task for Suicune thanks to its high defensive stat on both ends. Many semi-fast Pokemon like Mamoswine and Lucario would often switch-in, only taking Hydro Pump to the face twenty seconds later. Timid nature ensures I outpace Adamant Lucario, Rotom, and Mamoswine. Hydro Pump over Surf adds that extra umph to OHKO  Metagross, defensive Rotom, and even weakened Blissey. The only way I am losing is if it misses, but I really don't give two shits. Hidden Power  Electric adds another check to Gyarados when needed, and it allows me to hit weakened Vaporeon and Starmie for hard damage. Ice Beam hits Grass-types like Celebi for hard damage. It also hits Latias for super effective damage (back when it was in the tier.)</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Its been fun using this team and it definitely one of the best teams I created. Its easy to use because of Salamence. I've won several major tournaments wins with this, most notably the Smogon Tour OU Finals run. I would like some advise though on how I can keep my synergy, while replacing Salamence at the same time! Good Luck, 1.6k the next post.</p>
</div>

<p>As a final farewell to Salamence, who has departed to the Uber tier, it's appropriate to showcase a team that effectively utilized this monster to its greatest potential. franky's 'Big Dragon Leaves the Ghetto' is a unique take on the semi-stall playstyle. It combines spikestacking with a Salamence set designed to rip holes into the opponent's team in order to pave the way for a late-game Suicune sweep. He uses the then-unorthodox Machamp lead to immediately pressure the opponent and the famous SkarmBliss combo to set up entry hazards. Neatly rounding off the team is Choice Scarf Rotom-W, who checks common threats and provides spinblocking.</p>

<p>franky's lead of choice is the infamous Machamp, who was a rarity until players like panamaxis popularized it. As franky mentions, few people prepared for Machamp, so he was often able to gain an early  advantage. Essentially, Machamp gives the opponent two options: attack and lose the ability to use Stealth Rock, or use Stealth Rock and allow your lead to be obliterated. With its unique ability, No Guard, Machamp is able to fire off confusion-inducing DynamicPunches with perfect accuracy. Most of the time he will use this attack, but against Pok&eacute;mon like Azelf, Payback is the superior move. Ice Punch allows Machamp to defeat lead Gliscor, who usually walls the set, while Bullet Punch allows Machamp to attack first and kill Pok&eacute;mon who utilize Focus Sash. The EVs are designed to allow Machamp to survive standard lead Azelf's Psychic 100% of the time while enabling it to hit as hard as possible. Lum Berry is there so Machamp defeats sleep leads like Roserade and Smeargle.</p>

<p>Skarmory, the first part of the team's spikestacking duo lays Spikes that hinder the opponent's ability to switch out against his attacks, especially those coming from Salamence. If Skarmory can get 3 layers up, opposing grounded Pok&eacute;mon take a substantial 25% hit to their overall HP just to switch in. The set is creative in that it aims to give Skarmory, a physical wall, special bulk. While Skarmory is by no means a reliable special defender, the EVs allow it to set up Spikes on Pok&eacute;mon who it normally could not. Taunt is what makes the set shine; it allows Skarmory to shut down opposing defensive teams that rely on support moves to win. Whirlwind is there for phazing. Beyond preventing setups, it helps to wear down the opponent by increasing Spikes damage. The last slot is designated for Roost which provides Skarmory with reliable recovery.</p>

<p>To combat the metagame's special threats, franky uses the best special wall in the game, Blissey. Her immense HP and Special Defense allows her to take special attacks with ease. Pok&eacute;mon such as Rotom-A, Jolteon, and Heatran, who would otherwise pose a major threat to this team, are all easily handled by Blissey. By giving Blissey Stealth Rock, she has something to do besides just switching in to absorb an attack; she can set up a critical entry hazard. Thunder Wave is there to cripple common switch-ins such as Infernape and Lucario. Seismic Toss allows Blissey to damage opposing Pok&eacute;mon, and Softboiled gives her reliable healing. The EVs maximize her meager Defense so that she can handle some physical attacks. Additionally, by maximizing Blissey's HP, franky makes her a formidable defensive threat.</p>

<p>Few spikestacking teams are effective without a spinblocker. To keep pace with the rest of his team, franky implores a bulky variant of Choice Scarf Rotom-W. The bulkier spread allows it to switch into Starmie's Surf and Forretress' Payback easier. Thunderbolt is a solid STAB choice that allows franky to deal with opposing bulky Water-types like Suicune and Vaporeon. Shadow Ball is another STAB move that handles Gengar, Celebi, and (during the earlier stages of this team) Latias. Hydro Pump, the signature move of Rotom-W, allows the possessed washing machine to deal with Tyranitar, who would normally spell doom for any other Rotom forme. Lastly, Trick cripples opposing walls so Pokemon like Blissey cannot switch in with impunity. Futhermore, it gives franky a way to stop last Pok&eacute;mon stat-uppers.</p>

<p>Here he is, Salamence, the recently banished king of the OU metagame. He is notorious for his ability to rip teams apart. Draco Meteor is his main STAB attack. With 210 Base Power (including STAB) and Life Orb, it is going to do serious damage to any Pok&eacute;mon (who isn't named Blissey) who does not resist it. Flamethrower hits Pokemon like Scizor who is a common check to Salamence. If franky plays Salamence wisely, he can destroy what is likely his opponent's only check to Salamence and proceed to sweep. The next move is out of place. franky opts for Earthquake over Brick Break. Though he sacrifices his ability to 2HKO Blissey and OHKO Tyranitar, he can score an OHKO on Heatran. The last move on the set, Roost, allows Salamence to heal off Life Orb and Stealth Rock damage so that he can come back later in the game. This defensive move is crucial to this MixMence set. It's what gives this particular set such an advantage against opposing stall teams and allows it to act as a check to Pok&eacute;mon like Lucario. The EVs optimize Salamence's chances to sweep. With maximized Special Attack and Speed and a Naive nature, Salamence fills its sweeper role perfectly.</p> 

<p>Every other teammate paves the way for Suicune. The speedy offensive set is sure to catch players who expect a more commonplace defensive Suicune off guard. Calm Mind allows Suicune to stat-up yet does not blow its cover since defensive Suicune runs the same move. After one Calm Mind, Suicune is specially bulky and equiped to sweep. Its main STAB is the 120 Base Power Hydro Pump, a major suprise to those who expect Surf. For coverage, Suicune has the pseudo-BoltBeam combo. Hidden Power Electric destroys Gyarados and puts a dent in opposing Suicune and Vaporeon. Ice Beam allows Suicune to defeat dragons, particularly Salamence (even though he is now Uber). Because franky waits until the late-game to deploy this beast, the opponent is significant worn down by his spikestacking combination and his MixMence. Suicune is used to finish the opponent off. The EVs are simple. 252 Special Attack and 252 Speed with a Timid nature ensure that Suicune can effectively fill its role.</p>

<p>While this is certainly a fantastic team, it does have room for improvement. With Choice Band Azelf leads gaining popularity, lead Machamp has become outdated. Since Azelf is the most common lead, franky would be forced to constantly guess whether or not his opponent was carrying a Choice Band. Another issue this team faces is effectively dealing with Wish Calm Mind Jirachi. Currently, franky has to rely on parahax from Blissey, or Trick from Rotom-W to beat it; neither is a reliable method. Additionally, Life Orb Starmie is a major issue if it has Rapid Spin. Because of this, Rotom-W would benefit from a bulkier EV spread, especially since the Special Attack investment was tailored to 2HKO Latias, who is no longer in the OU metagame. Lastly, Salamence would be a much more effective sweeper with Brick Break over Earthquake, since Earthquake is only useful in OHKOing Heatran; this is a moot point though, because Salamence is now banned. Ultimately, these few setbacks do not stop Team 'Big Dragon Leaves the Ghetto' from being an excellent team.</p>
