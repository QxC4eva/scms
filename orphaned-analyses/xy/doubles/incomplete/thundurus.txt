Overview
########
Electric-STAB is always useful
Has Prankster, which along with usable 79 / 70 / 80 defenses makes Thundurus very annoying
Great offensively with base 125 SpA and base 111 Speed
A lot of support options, such as Thunder Wave, Taunt, Swagger, Substitute, and Rain Dance
Weaknesses to Ice- and Rock-type moves which a both common in the current metagame
Electric-types are now immune to Thunder Wave, making spreading paralysis harder then before
While 79 / 70 / 80 defenses are okay you're still frail; you won't be taking very many strong neutral hits even

Moves
========
Thunderbolt serves as primary STAB move and is good for hitting things like Charizard-Mega-Y and Suicune hard
Hidden Power Ice serves as coverage and deals heavy damage to common Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T; if coverage isn't needed for whatever reason Taunt is an option to prevent field effects like Trick Room from going up and to stop status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Spore from being used
Substitute is useful for serving as a semi-Protect and guarding Thundurus from Sleep Powders and Spores that may come its way. Taunt is also fine in this slot for same reasons stated above (under bullet point 2)
Thunder Wave is basically the big point of this set. With its higher bulk (than other Thundurus sets) it can last longer, giving it more time to support its teammates with ever-so-useful speed control
Set Details
========
The given HP investment makes HP divisible by 16 so Leftovers will heal as much as possible. The additional defensive investment allows you to survive a Timid LO Latios Draco Meteor and unboosted Adamant Landorus-T Stone Edge, respectively. 20 Spe EVs will move before maximum Speed Jolly base 70s, most notably Breloom. Remaining EVs are dumped into SpA so you can hit as hard as possible
Leftovers is the item of choice if you opt to run Substitute, since the constant healing it provides will allow you to generate more Substitutes. If you use Taunt in slot 3 instead, Sitrus Berry is preferred for more immediate recovery
If you are running Sitrus Berry, an alternative spread of 244 HP / 108 Def / 60 SpA / 72 SpD / 20 Spe and a Modest Nature is possible, accomplishing the same benchmarks of the spread above except with HP being divisible by 4 (max Sitrus recovery), and you get 8 extra SpA EVs to hit a tad harder with
