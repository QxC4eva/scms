<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 40% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Seed Flare, the signature move of Shaymin and Shaymin-S, is a great move in their arsenals. While unfortunately having imperfect accuracy, the high power and great chance to lower Special Defense more than makes up for it. In the case of Shaymin-S, Seed Flare has a jaw-dropping 67% chance to lower the opponent's Special Defense, factoring in accuracy. This can easily lead to walls like Lugia or Blissey being easily dealt with either by Shaymin-S or other special attackers, as they no longer have mammoth Special Defense stats to help them take hits.</p>
