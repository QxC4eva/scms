<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I started building this team a couple of months back because I was keen to playtest the new Dream World metagame, and I knew that to challenge for top spot on the DW Ladder in order pass for voting requirements, a solid Sand/Rain offensive team would be the best way to achieve such a feat. I felt there weren't as many people trying through the earlier stages of the first stage of DW, as I found myself in the top 10 in a matter of no time whatsoever. </p>

<p>There was a spell where I dropped down to dissapointing #30th after my unsuccessful "Rain-troll" team, consisting of Politoed, Keldeo, Garchomp, Breloom, Thundurus and Genesect. I reverted back to sand in pursuit of those [RS] users and one or two council members near the top. </p>

<p>The main strategy is to easily summon your weather (SashTtar) and lure out their Politoed; I then proceed to sack Chandelure after delivering Shadow Ball/Energy Ball before it faints, so my Tyranitar can then Pursuit Politoed before it gets a chance to escape. From there, it was down to Excadrill, Blaziken and Garchomp to abuse SandStream and put the opponent under enough pressure he/she cannot begin to execute their own "plan of action".</p>

<p>Note: I have tested Keldeo/Breloom over Genesect but prefer the extra Focus Sash user and its coverage to do lots of damage prior to whipping out a sandstorm.</p>

<p>I've switched positions with mostwanted, brii and, on occasion, Frizy... all fighting for 1st place. </p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/248.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Crunch / Roar<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Pursuit / Roar<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<pFocus Sash and Tyranitar may be suited better for the Battle Subway or even VGC. However, Dream World tends to be a fast-paced metagame which may slightly resemble "Ubers", in a sense that you're trading off powerhouses until the better team's opportunity presents itself. Watching their Terrakion fall straight off the face of this planet is a blessing in any metagame.</p>

<p>The spread is your run-in-the-mill 252/252 spread, expecting enemy TTar leads; so I raised my Tyranitar's Speed to accommodate for that. If I was up against Rain, I'd usually lead with Genesect instead. I can save Tyranitar at 1HP if necessary because Excadrill's Rapid Spin can be vitally important. </p>

<p><strong>Genesect</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Download<br />
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Thunderbolt</p>

<p>By the time I came back around to remaking Genesect, I had still yet to reach first place. Focus Sash Genesect has the move variety that hits so many targets for super effective damage, with Download boosting your elemental attacks or U-turn. I stopped using Genesect and switched to Focus Sash Garchomp, with Keldeo in its place. </p>

<p>However, when I'd use Garchomp to lead against [RS] user with SashGenesect, I'd get frozen or they'd simply U-turn out to Chandelure. He wasn't using Naive on his Genesect, to which I figured would help me prosper when I'd use my own; they'd Flamethrower me thinking I wasn't Focus Sash (instead, Choice Scarf) but would lose because I could U-turn due to being faster on the second turn.</p>

<p>It was then when I decided that I'd revert back to Salac Berry Chomp, rely on Chandelure and Genesect to gape holes in physical defenses.</p>

<p><strong>Blaziken</strong> @ Air Balloon<br />
Ability: Speed Boost<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- Hi Jump Kick<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>I wouldn't use Blaziken without either Protect or Baton Pass in Dream World. I've used all kinds of Blaziken before, yet this one is without a doubt the most effective set. After one Swords Dance, those calculations don't do justice for just how big of a performer Blaziken is. Protect is handy for checking yourself against other Blaziken, but Hi Jump Kick is sin as much as it can be a saint. Should you use your own Chandelure correctly, Blaziken should be getting at least one kill per game and if not, you're doing it horribly wrong. </p>

<p>It's dual-stab's Base Power are exceptionally great, which is why usually most of us choose Adamant over Jolly; that, and personally I'm not aware of Jolly Blaziken's figures seeing as without Chandelure, it's very easily walled. </p>

<p><strong>Garchomp</strong> @ Salac Berry<br />
Ability: Sand Veil<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>The first Garchomp set that came to my mind in Dream World was BrightPowder, and for unmistakable reasons. Considering strongly whether or not I could rely on such a cheap tactic for success, I opted for a fresh item in Salac Berry to ensure I could outspeed the metagame (bar Deoxys-S, Excadrill and Protect-lucky Blaziken) and proceed to sweep.</p>

<p>If there was one moveset I would consider changing, it is definitely this one though. Dragon Claw lacks the power versus the bulkiest of checks and ones which resist Earthquake are a nightmare to deal with. Regenerator Amoongus + Shed Shell (props to brii) was tanking this for fun and escaped all Chandelure attempts to collar it.</p>

<p><strong>Chandelure</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Shadow Tag<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Overheat<br />
- Hidden Power Ice<br />
- Energy Ball</p>

<p>I don't think there is a better Choice Scarf user in Dream World. Whether Chandelure + Shadow Tag is broken remains a mystery until us council members gather together and discuss his position on the grander scale of things. Unless Blaziken is running Flare Blitz, Stealth Rock and is equipped with a Swords Dance boost (or Baton Pass), you're Blaziken troubles are comfortably dealt with. </p>

<p>It's sufficient at dealing enough damage to Politoed prior to calling upon Tyranitar and Pursuit-trapping Politoed so I control the weather.</p>

<p><strong>Excadrill</strong> @ Air Balloon<br />
Ability: Sand Rush<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Rock Slide<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Rapid Spin</p>

<p>Excadrill was chosen as 1/3 of the team's sweeper core. It has trouble with Air Balloon users outside of the common Skamory/Gliscor (former carries Shed Shell), but one of Dream World's fastest threats means it's very versatile and can be saved until a Swords Dance opportunity arises itself. Breloom has to be caught by Chandelure before I attempt to sweep. </p>

<p>I have used Jolly, but prefer Adamant to hit Skamory harder and hope for a flinch.</p>
