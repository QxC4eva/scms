<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Unless you've been living under a rock for the past couple of months or  are a complete noob, you'd know that the UU ladder has been added to the  Smogon server, and Suspect Testing has been underway.  In case you  missed it, here is a recap of what happened during the last two rounds  of UU.</p>

<h2>Round 1</h2>

<p>Round 1 was, in short, a crazy and chaotic time.  It was full of  speculation, trial and error, and huge surprises.  So, what exactly went  on in Round 1?</p>

<h3>Vulpix and her following of sun worshipers:</h3>

<p>One of the most speculated and expected trends going into round one was  what kind of effect Vulpix and its ability Drought would have on the  metagame.  Many thought that sun would have free reign in a tier with  only two other instant weather changers (both of which are pretty weak  to sun teams) to compete with, as well as a complete lack of Drizzle.   And free reign it did have.  With Darmanitan, Volcarona, Chandelure, and  Venusaur being the only sun-abusers absent from UU, sun teams had a ton  of fire power (pun intended) left to play with.  Among these abusers  included the multitude of Chlorophyll Pokemon (particularly Sawsbuck,  Victreebel, and Lilligant), Solar Power Charizard, as well as Victini  and its newly acquired power move V-create.  And what's more, sun teams  were easy to use and won more often than not.</p>

<p>So what did a typical sun team look like?  Most sun teams consisted of  Vulpix and Victini, 1-3 Chlorophyll Pokemon, and 1-2 supporters to  combat enemy sun and hail teams (typically Chansey, Slowbro, and / or  Hitmontop).  The main strategy behind sun teams was to lead with Vulpix,  and then just spam the other sun abusers.  Victini's insane V-create  was abused to its fullest with a simple Choice Band, Choice Scarf, or  Life Orb set.  The Chlorophyll Pokemon typically carried a Life Orb, set  up with Swords Dance, Growth, or Quiver Dance, and then swept the  opposition.  Like I said, pretty simple right?</p>

<p>What was sun's lasting effect on the metagame?  Well, by the time the  round was ending, it was pretty clear that sun teams were broken.  Many  blamed Victini for its brokenness, and that getting rid of it would kind  of cure the metagame.  Others disagreed, and figured it was a  combination of Victini and the Chlorophyllers.  In the end, only Drought  got the boot out, forever ending the sun's reign in UU.</p>

<h3>Kyurem and the hail</h3>

<p>While Kyurem was largely forgotten in OU, people were quick to realize  that the frozen chicken would have a huge effect on the UU metagame.   Just looking at its stats tells you that you've got a powerhouse on your  hands; combine that with its awesome offensive typing, good movepool,  and infinite hail (along with a 100% accurate STAB Blizzard) to support  it from Abomasnow, and you have quite the force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>So what effect did Kyurem have on the metagame?  A huge one, to put it  mildly.  Even with sun teams running rampant in the tier, Kyurem was  able to hold its own and become the second most used Pokemon in UU.   Kyurem basically required every team to run a Pokemon to absorb its  insanely powerful Draco Meteors, Outrages, and Blizzards (usually  Chansey, Registeel, or Slowbro).  Besides having to worry about the  strong attacks Kyurem was throwing left and right, you also had no idea  which set your opponent was running until it was too late.  Kyurem was  very, very versatile.  The most common set was a simple Specs set, but  Kyurem could also easily run Sub + 3 Attacks, Sub + Hone Claws, Choice  Band, Choice Scarf, and even defensive Sub + Dragon Tail sets.</p>

<p>Ultimately, even with the presence of sun teams, Kyurem was deemed too  powerful for the metagame, accumulating an astonishing 100% ban from the  voters, and got the boot.</p>

<h3>The Pink Menace aka Chansey</h3>

<p>Even before the formation of OU, an item was discovered within the new  BW games that would boost the defenses of pre-evolutions called the  Eviolite (or Evolution Stone back then).  Immediately, speculation  surrounded which pre-evolutions would benefit the most from this item,  and Chansey was on top of this list.  With overall defenses that would  surpass even those of its evolution, people thought Chansey would become  the end-all-be-all special wall of the metagame.  Unfortunately for the  pink blob, Blissey is still used more thanks to, ironically enough, its  ability to hold items other than the Eviolite (namely Leftovers).  Due  to this, Chansey's usage fell enough for it to drop into UU.</p>

<p>People were quick to jump at the chance to use Chansey for all of their  walling needs within UU.  Thanks to the relative lack of harmful weather  and entry hazards (which meant that the lack of Leftovers wasn't as big  of a deal), all people had to do was stick Chansey on their team and  special attacks (and even some physical ones) were all but leaves in the  wind on the way to victory.</p>

<p>So what effect did Chansey have on the metagame?  Enough of an impact to  make some people think that the pink blob was broken, even with Drought  and Kyurem in the tier.  More than that, though, Chansey forced all but  the strongest special attackers completely out of the metagame, and  those that could beat Chansey one-on-one (Mew, Deoxys-D, Azelf) normally  relied on Taunt, Psyshock, and either Toxic or entry hazard support to  penetrate the blob's pudgy hide.  Unfortunately for Chansey haters, she  fell way short of being banned from the metagame, with only half  (exactly 50%) deeming Chansey too strong for the metagame.</p>

<h3>SmashPass</h3>

<p>SmashPassing is a strategy in which the goal is to have either one of  Gorebyss, Smeargle, or Huntail use Shell Smash, then Baton Pass to a  teammate to decimate the opposition.  While at first this strategy seems  simple and straightforward, and a little bit crazy considering Shell  Smash lowers the users defenses as well, the strategy gets far more  convoluted when you add in the other components of the team.  Most  dedicated SmashPass teams followed a specific battle strategy, and  normally consisted of Azelf or Uxie, 1-2 SmashPassers, and 3 receivers.   The strategy normally followed the order of setting up dual screens  with the lead Uxie or Azelf and then using Memento,  then bringing in  the passer and using Shell Smash as the opponent was weakened  (recovering the loss of defenses with a White Herb), setting up  Substitute if possible, and then Baton Passing to one of the three  receivers.  Almost any Pokemon becomes a force to be reckoned with at +2  Atk, +2 SpA, +2 Spe, but there were some that were far above others.   Espeon gained fame as a receiver thanks to its ability Magic Bounce and  its access to the move Stored Power.  Due to its ability, Espeon could  not be phazed out or Taunted, and only Haze could eliminate its stat  boosts.  Mamoswine was another powerhouse thanks to its huge base 130  Attack stat and priority in Ice Shard.</p>

<p>So what effect did SmashPassing have on the metagame?  At first, people  cried bloody murder that the strategy as a whole was broken, as with  Espeon being the receiver, there was little you could do as a player to  beat it without dedicating your team to beating SmashPass (i.e carrying  Haze and Taunting the lead Pokemon with something faster, such as  Crobat).  However, once people learned how and when to strike the  SmashPass team, it became less broken in the eyes of the voters, coming  away with a simple majority 64.29% ban, meaning it would stick around  for at least one more round.</p>


<h2>Round 2</h2>

<p>The latest round of UU was a little more stable than Round 1.  Still,  new strategies were found every day, and every battle was sure to harbor  a surprise.  So, what went on in Round 2?</p>

<h3>Starap(e)tor</h3>

<p>Towards the tail-end of Round 1, the power of Staraptor was unleashed  unto the metagame.  Mirroring its last stint in UU, Staraptor terrorized  the tier with its powerful attacks and Speed.  Only this time,  Staraptor was packing even more artillery.  Thanks to the Dream World,  Staraptor was given a god-send in the ability Reckless, which powers up  its already powerful STAB recoil moves, namely Brave Bird and  Double-Edge.</p>

<p>So what effect did Staraptor have on the metagame?  Staraptor basically  forced every team to pack at least 2 Pokemon that could absorb its  strongest attacks, usually Rhyperior, Eviolite Dusclops, or Registeel.   It also made the 100 base Speed tier that much more of an important  benchmark.  If your Pokemon sat above that mark, you were golden.  If  your Pokemon fell short, they were usually in constant danger, and they  had better be bulky if they wanted to stick around long.</p>

<p>So what made Staraptor so dangerous?  Its sheer power, for one.  With  the appropriate move, Staraptor was quite capable of 2HKOing nearly  every wall in the tier whilst holding just a Life Orb.  Its  unpredictability was another big factor.  Staraptor was fully capable of  running a Choice Band, Scarf, Life Orb, or SubRoost set. If you  predicted wrong against a Staraptor, it could very easily result in a  KOed Pokemon.</p>

<p>In the end, Staraptor was deemed far too powerful for the metagame, and was handed a ban by 88% of the voters.</p>

<h3>Espeon and Baton Pass</h3>

<p>SmashPass was just as relevant in Round 2 as in Round 1, except this  time Espeon gained a new toy via the Dream World: a way to breed Baton  Pass onto an Espeon with the ability Magic Bounce.  With this new  capability, Espeon no longer had to be a dedicated receiver on a  SmashPass team.  Instead, she was capable of continuing the chain once  the baton was passed to her.  This provided SmashPass teams (and Baton  Pass teams in general) with a much needed way to bypass Taunt and  phazing moves, making Haze and Perish Song the only surefire ways to  break the chain.</p>

<p>Not only were SmashPass teams and Espeon abusing Baton Pass, but there  were many other "short pass" teams raiding the tier.  Short passing is  exactly what it sounds like.  Instead of basing the whole team on Baton  Pass, there is usually only 1 or 2 Pokemon on the team with a boosting  move, and they pass directly to the receiver without garnering any other  boosts on the way.  Mew, Smeargle, Celebi, and Venomoth came to the  forefront as short passers in Round 2.  Mew and Smeargle are obvious  candidates for short passers due to their enormous movepools and  capability of passing nearly every kind of boost imaginable.  Celebi,  while not having nearly as many options as Mew, does come with just as  much surprise factor as a short passer.  This is mostly because most  Celebi are straight sweepers or defensive supporters.  Usually, when a  player sees Celebi switch into their Suicune, their instinct is to  suspect a special attacking offensive set and run to the hills to grab  their special wall (coughChanseycough).  Unfortunately for the opponent,  that same Celebi can instead use Swords Dance as they switch out, which  will either directly threaten the opponent's wall, or allow Celebi to  pass to a physical sweeper to take advantage of the situation.  Finally,  Venomoth is the only Pokemon, besides Smeargle and Masquerain, that  gets both Quiver Dance and Baton Pass.  This combination is even more  threatening when paired with Sleep Powder, which allows Venomoth an  entirely free turn to set up and then Baton Pass to a teammate.  The  most popular Pokemon for Venomoth to Baton Pass to was  Nidoking, who  with a Quiver Dance boost or two under its belt was very capable of  annihilating most of the tier thanks to its Sheer Force-boosted moves.</p>

<p>In the end, even with all of the controversy surrounding Baton Pass,  only Espeon received a 96% ban, and was kicked out of the tier for good.</p>

<h3>Chansey Vs. the Trappers</h3>

<p>Chansey garnered even more hate in this round thanks to its ability to  just sit and wall a substantial portion of the metagame with its  defenses alone.  However, with sun now out of the equation, Dugtrio and  Wobbuffet were able to come out of their caves and assume the role they  were born to play: trapping.  What better way to dispose of a dirty blob  than trap it and ensure it can't run away (and if you're Wobbuffet,  proceed to Tickle it to death)?  One of the best and easiest ways (if  you could predict correctly and ran enough Speed) was to send Wobbuffet  in on Chansey, set up Safe Guard to block Thunder Wave and Toxic (or  Encore Softboiled or Wish), and spam Tickle.  Once Chansey's Defense was  lowered enough, all you had to do was send in a Pokemon with Pursuit  and say sayonara to the pink menace.</p>

<p>Of course, Chansey wasn't the trappers' only target.  Wobbuffet was just  as capable as ever, and even with the Encore nerf it was causing a lot  of headaches in the tier.  Dugtrio wasn't used quite as much due to its  general frailty and relative lack of power, but it still provided a last  resort check to multiple top tier threats, including Empoleon,  Registeel, Cobalion, and Rhyperior (if they were sufficiently weakened  before-hand).</p>

<p>In the end, the voters deemed Wobbuffet too cheap, and saluted him a 92% ban out of the tier.</p>

<h3>Hail minus Kyurem</h3>

<p>While hail lost its biggest gun in Kyurem, it was still a major factor  in the metagame, with many of the top teams on the ladder abusing it to  its fullest.  Hail's other big perks were its ability to capably check  Staraptor with STAB Blizzards and Ice Shards and, as most hail teams  were defensive in nature, most carried a phazer to counter Baton Pass  teams.</p>

<p>So what did a typical hail team look like?  Most basic defensive teams  consisted of Abomasnow, Froslass, Mamoswine (more commonly seen on  offensive teams), and Walrein for Ice-types, and then 1-3 of Nidoqueen,  Hitmontop, and Chansey to absorb Rock-, Fighting-, and Fire-type  attacks, respectively.  As most teams were defensive stall teams, the  goal was to lay as many entry hazards as possible (Froslass covering  Spikes and Nidoqueen covering Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes), keep entry  hazards off of their side of the field with Rapid Spin, then stall out  the opponent as long as possible.</p>

<p>What effect did hail have on the metagame?  Towards the end of the  round, many people suspected hail of being broken due to several  different reasons.  The first was the Snow Cloak evasion boost granted  to Mamoswine, Glaceon, and particularly Froslass.  This evasion boost  was very capable of turning an easily won game to a loss due to a miss.   Not only that, but Froslass could easily hax your team to death through  misses and paralysis, while sitting behind a Substitute and basically  screwing your team out of a win. The second was most hail teams' use of  Wobbuffet.  Thanks to Wobbuffet, the team could ensure that any hard  counter could easily be disposed of, and continue to either BlizzSpam or  stall to victory.  Lastly, if the team carried Espeon, it was nearly  impossible to counter the hail team with entry hazards, or even Taunt or  phaze the defensive Pokemon.</p>

<p>While there was a ton of controversy towards the end of the round, Snow  Warning only received a 37.5% Ban, ensuring that hail will be around for  at least another round.</p>

<h2>Get out there and play!</h2>

<p>Round 3 is just around the corner, and with Chansey, hail, and many  other threats still buzzing around the tier, the next suspect rounds are  sure to be packed with even more controversy, speculation, and  surprises.  Hope to see you on the ladder!</p>
