The user always attacks first.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of +1.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Probably the least used of all priority moves, despite being the one with the greatest distribution. There are simply no good abusers, and being a Normal-type move means that it hits nothing super effectively. The only case where you will see an effective user is Swellow; after Guts is active, the bird gains an enormous Attack level, and his blistering natural Speed makes him a threatening sweeper. Thus, he can often only be revenge killed via priority, so can avoid being prematurely killed by running Quick Attack, and is also a good move for killing weakened Scarf users. Scyther is another decent candidate thanks to its good Attack stat, Technician, and the fact that is the only priority move it has access to.</p>
