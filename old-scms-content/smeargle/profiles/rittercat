<h3>Who is RitterCat?</h3>

<p>Hi! Although I only started doing art for the site in early 2012, I've been involved in the Smeargle's scene for much longer. After lurking for 6 months, I started my art thread, and it's been going nearly constantly since then. I love drawing, which I do constantly, and Smogon is great as I can draw for the Smog or onsite articles or even just avatar requests! In Smeargle's Studio I also run the Weekly Spriting Contest with my co-host Rodan, and in other areas of the site, I am a member of the Grammar-Prose Team, and spend a lot of my time in various irc channels.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>

<p>I have an artist badge for my work in The Smog, a golden luvdisc (currently 83 in total) on my art thread, and have placed second in the Monthly Art Contest.</p>
