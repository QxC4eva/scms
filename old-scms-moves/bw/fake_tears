[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lowers the target's Special Defense by two stages. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Fake Tears helps special attackers to break through special walls more easily, and can cause them to switch out, causing them to take entry hazard damage if hazards are present. If a special attacker has access to it Nasty Plot is generally a better option, as Fake Tears must be used repeatedly in order to have the same effect as a single Nasty Plot boost.</p>
