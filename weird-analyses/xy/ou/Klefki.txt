Overview
########
- The only Pokemon in the game with access to Prankster Dual Screens and Spikes.
- With Prankster, Kelfki is able to get up Dual Screens and/or Spikes immediately, giving it the liberty to not invest a single EV in speed, but instead direct them towards bulk.
- Klefki has one of the best defensive typings in the entire game, giving it a list of resistances.
- Klefki's wide variety of support moves allows it to play a few good roles in between laying Spikes and setting up Dual Screens.
- Its lack of offensive presence makes it rather easy to switch into.
- Subpar stats keep it from making the best use out of its grand defensive typing.
- Lack of Taunt really bites as it makes it vulnerable to the move itself and allows other Pokemon to set up hazards alongside it.
- A rather niche Pokemon though, as it faces competition as a hazard setter from Deoxys-D and a dual screens user from Deoxys-S, and unlike the other two, it struggles immensely with Defog users.

Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Spikes
move 4: Foul Play / Dazzling Gleam
ability: Prankster 
item: Light Clay 
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD

Moves
========
- Priority Reflect + Light Screen amplifies Klefki's and its team's bulk significantly, allowing it to set up on even certain super effective hits AND give its teammates an easier time at getting a sweep going.
- Spikes can be used for further support by turning 3HKOs to 2HKOs or 2HKOs to OHKOs.
- Dazzling Gleam is Klefki's most reliable STAB, while Foul Play discourages physical attackers from setting up alongside it.

Set Details
========
- Light Clay is used so that duration of Reflect + Light Screen is increased by a few more turns.
- The EV spread with a Bold nature gives Klefki the most optimal defense stats, reaching 320 HP, 281 Defense, and 236 Special Defense; these stats give it solid defenses in both of its defenses, allowing Klefki to set up on both powerful physical and special attackers alike.

Usage Tips
========
- Generally the set works best as a lead for hyper offensive teams.
- Shell Smash teams or teams that want to give their sweepers more leg room to get going can also appreciate this support.
Due to Klefki's great typing and decent bulk, it can attempt to set up Dual Screens multiple times throughout the match, so it's generally imprudent to sacrifice it once it gets screens up.

Team Options
========
- Klefki works well on hyper offensive teams in need of a Pokemon that can set up dual screens that's both resilient while providing some form of defensive synergy.
- This set is almost entirely focused on supporting your team, so set up sweepers such as Belly Drum Azumarill, Tail Glow Manaphy, Shell Smash Gorebyss, Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados, Swords Dance Mega Mawile, and many others can make great use of dual screens support.
- The only thing to watch out for is Defog users; carrying a Thundurus-I or other speedy Taunt users can be useful to make sure that Klefki's efforts don't go to waste.
- In addition, Bisharp and Defiant Thundurus also makes good partners to discourage the use of Defog.

Utility
########
name: Utility
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Dazzling Gleam
move 3: Thunder Wave
move 4: Foul Play
ability: Prankster
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD

Moves
========
- Spikes works amazingly well with Prankster, allowing Klefki to set up multiple layers of entry hazards.
- Thunder Wave works quite well as stopping speed sweepers such as Mega Pinsir and Dragon Dance Charizard X should you fall into a situation where they attempt to sweep your team.
- Dazzling Gleam works rather well against a slew of prominent defog users such as Latios, Latias, and Mandibuzz.
- Foul Play on the other hand gives very good coverage with Fairy-type moves and tuns the tables on fearsome physical attackers that might switch into Klefki, such as Excadrill.

Set Details
========
- The EV spread with a Bold nature gives Klefki the most optimal defense stats, reaching 320 HP, 281 Defense, and 236 Special Defense; these stats give it solid defenses in both of its defenses, allowing Klefki to set up on both powerful physical and special attackers alike.

Usage Tips
========
- This Klefki can work either as an effective lead or be saved mid-game to set up some handy spikes.
- This pokemon is better used for its utility, so it's better to not mindlessly switch it into powerful attacks and force it to take on the role of a wall.
- On the other hand, Prankster Thunder Wave provides immense assurance against many set up sweepers, so if Klefki has worn out its usefulness, it can sacrifice itself at the cost of crippling the opponent's main sweeper.

Team Options
========
- This Klefki generally fits on balanced teams in need of a Pokemon that can set up Spikes and act as quick "panic button" for threatening sweepers via Prankster Thunder Wave.
- Thundurus-I is an excellent partner as it stops the likes of Deoxys formes and Skarmory from ruining Klefki's day.
- Bisharp is a good partner, as it discourages the use of Defog.
- This Pokemon pairs well with slower wall breakers that can make use of Spikes and Thunder Wave support; Mega Garchomp, Mega Charizard-Y, and Kyurem-B greatly appreciate Klefki's support.

Other Options
########

- A Toxic stalling with Torment is also a viable option, though it is rather helpless against Steel-types
- Imprison may be used to stop opposing Spikes and Dual Screen users from setting up alongside Klefki, but you sacrifice a moveslot in doing so.
- Calm Mind can be used in an attempt to sweep with moves such as Draining Kiss, Flash Cannon, and Psyshock, but it is rather weak.
- Switcheroo is a neat disruption tactic when paired with moves such as Iron Ball, Choice-items, and Toxic Orb and is especially effective given that defensive Pokemon are more often likely to switch into Klefki.
- The infamous swagplay set is an option consisting of moves such as Swagger, Thunder Wave, Substitute, and Foul Play; although this set is a gimmick to say the least as it falls flat on its face versus defensive teams.

Checks & Counters
########
- Bulky Taunt users such as Heatran, Gliscor, and Skarmory stop it dead in its tracks.
- Prankster Taunt users such as Thundurus-I work to stop Klefki from setting up.
- Powerful Electric-types likes Rotom-W and Magnezone can plow through it, while Magnezone can even trap and kill it.
- Powerful Ground-types such as Excadrill and Landorus can easily take it down, though they do have to watch out for Foul Play.
- Tricking Klefki or Encoring it can also make it useless, though be wary of Switcheroo as a counter-measure to this.
- Defog in general can make Klefki's efforts go to waste; some good examples of Defog users that switch into Klefki easily are Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor.
