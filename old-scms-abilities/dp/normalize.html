[SHORT DESC]
All moves used by this Pokémon are Normal-type. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>All attacks used by this Pokémon act as if Normal-type—if the user is Normal, they get STAB, and they are always resisted by Rock and Steel Pokémon and are ineffective against Ghosts. A Normalized Will-O-Wisp will not activate Flash Fire and will burn Ghosts. Fire-types will not be burned because they are immune to the burn status.</p>
