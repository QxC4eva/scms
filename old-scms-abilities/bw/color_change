Foe's move changes the Pokemon's type.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>After all hits from a damaging attack by another Pokemon, the wielder's type will change to the type of that move. Moves affected by <a href="/bw/abilities/sheer_force">Sheer Force</a> do not activate Color Change. This ability will not activate if the wielder is behind a <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Color Change is more trouble than it's worth. Changing type to hopefully resist your opponent's next attack sounds nifty on paper, but nearly every Pokemon out there carries some form of coverage that can hit your Pokemon for neutral damage. What's worse is that common coverage combos like Dark + Fighting and Rock + Ground can line you up to take super effective damage. Color Change is a major thorn in <a href="/bw/pokemon/kecleon">Kecleon</a>'s side and one of the many reasons you'll almost never see it, even in NU.</p>
