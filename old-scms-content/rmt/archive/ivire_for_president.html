<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Yeah so I was thinking of some good ass combos to begin with about a week ago. Scyther + Torterra immediately came to mind. Pokemon that can swap into Scyther reliably: Milotic, Rhyperior, Donphan, Registeel, Regirock, Omastar. All those Pokemon are fairly handily beaten by Torterra. Torterra's counters are pretty limited to bulky grass types, aka easy pickings for Scyther. Originally I had Choice Band Scyther, but then I saw Random Pizzaman abuse a Swords Dance + Lum Berry Scyther, and I knew that I had to use that. So with this I knew I wanted to build my team to have great synergy, so that with every Pokemon I used, their counters would be exploited. I had this great synergy with Scyther and Torterra.</p>

<p>I knew Fire-types would screw me over if they got in on a kill, and I needed a solid switch into them. I was thinking of using Milotic; I mean Recover and Haze is just too good to pass up! But I really wanted something...anti-metagame. I thought about Calm Mind + Encore Golduck, but it wasn't bulky enough and its pure Water typing, while good, wasn't what I was looking for. So I was looking at the Pokemon list, and I saw Lanturn. Fuck yes Lanturn. I didn't want some pussy ResTalk Lanturn, and I had seen someone abuse Lanturn's 404 HP Subs to defeat Registeel and Chansey, so I decided to try that. </p>

<p>Okay so I reviewed my team. What would work well with Lanturn? Lanturn can set up in the face of every bulky water in existence (Swampert?), so probably something that could lure in bulky waters and take on Venusaur. A solid Fire-type came to mind. Houndoom and Blaziken were ruled out immediately due to their frailty, so this really left Moltres and Arcanine. I considered Choice Band Arcanine or some other form of it, but in the end I ruled it out. While the lesser Stealth Rock weakness helped its survivability, I preferred Moltres' typing (Ground immunity, Fighting resist, 4x Bug Weakness) and most importantly his POWER! I couldn't pass up his bulk + power, even with his Stealth Rock weakness.</p>

<p>My next priority was 100% a spinner. Two 4x Stealth Rock weaks meant that I needed one. I had Blastoise, Hitmontop, Donphan, and Kabutops. I immediately ruled out Hitmontop; he was Venusaur bait and I already don't like Venusaur! I also ruled out Donphan because I never find him really effective without a Pursuiter, which I did not have. I considered doing LO Pursuit Absol + Donphan; it could simultaneously remove Ghosts and Chansey for SR to be spun, and to help Moltres. I decided not to, however, since with no form of recovery Lanturn would be taking the brunt of my fire attacks. So I wanted Blastoise or Kabutops. Blastoise just yells "hey bring in your spin blocker" and can't 2HKO any common spin blocker (maybe scarf rotom). Kabutops provides me a secondary Fire-type check in case Lanturn goes down, and gives me some much needed priority. Plus Ghosts don't like eating +2 Rock Slide or Aqua Jet.</p>

<p>I needed a defensive pivot, which needed to cover Venusaur, and may or may not have Stealth Rock, since I could always stick them on Torterra. I thought of Weezing. I thought of Registeel. I couldn't think of much else that could really reliably beat Venusaur. I decided on Registeel because of the gaping Rotom / Mismagius weakness I had. Registeel is also, in my opinion, the second best pokemon in the metagame (second only to BLSaur). It can check a ridiculous number of threats, and is generally an amazing switch into so many things when you're unsure of what to do. It can spread paralysis and lure in Rhyperior and Donphan for Torterra to abuse. SO MY TEAM WAS CREATED!</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/123.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Scyther</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Aerial Ace<br />
- Brick Break<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Swords Dance</p>

<p>I know it's a really unorthodox lead, but fuck it works so amazingly well! The pixies are murdered by this thing. Mesprit is taking around 70% and Uxie 50% as I U-turn to Registeel or Torterra or whatever. If I feel like it, I will Swords Dance as they either Thunder Wave or Stealth Rock. If they Thunder Wave, I get a free +2 U-turn on whatever they bring in, and if they Stealth Rock I can U-turn out, usually to Kabutops, since this thing is luring in Arcanine, Moltres, and Rhyperior like nobody's business, which lets me get my spin off. I play Scyther like this: cause as much damage as you possibly can in the early game, and grab the momentum with a well placed U-turn, and play off his useful Grass- and Fighting-type resistances in the mid-game to keep the momentum on my side until the late game, where, if no opportunity to set up and do some damage occurs, I will just sacrifice him to get in one of my sweepers to do some damage.</p>

<p>Now, that isn't to say Scyther is some suicidal Pokemon. Quite the opposite, in fact. Scyther is built to stay around all game with his amazing typing and decent bulk. Many times, I need to bring in something on a Leaf Storm and keep the momentum on my side. Scyther to the rescue! His 4x resistance to Fighting also comes in handy vs Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, and Hariyama. Scyther is also amazing for giving me free switch ins. As previously stated, he and Torterra have amazing synergy. A lesser known fact is that Scyther and Lanturn have great synergy, since Lanturn loves OHKOing bulky Ground-types and setting up on Water-types. He also focuses on beating Registeel through Swords Dance and Lum Berry. Sometimes I will Swords Dance as Registeel comes in and Brick Break for the 2HKO, and sometimes I will Swords Dance again. It just depends on the situation. In any case, Scyther starts of 90% of my battles in a good situation with all the momentum on my side. </p>

<p><strong>Torterra</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Overgrow<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Wood Hammer<br />
- Synthesis<br />
- Rock Slide</p>

<p>BIG FUKIN TORTOISE IN DA HOUSE! Man Torterra is really good in this metagame. LO Earthquake is dealing a fuckton to anything, and Wood Hammer pretty much 2HKOs everything that doesn't resist it. Torterra is definitely the most important Pokemon on my team and the cornerstone to this team's success. Registeel can really fuck me up if Torterra is dead. I learned that the hard way. Torterra is great for it's ability to switch into a) Rhyperior b) Rhyperior. Rhyperior is a HUGE threat, and it is able to literally OHKO my entire team, bar Torterra. Torterra is also great for the ability to straight up OHKO Milotic without any set up. He forces so many switches, allowing me to control the match. If you are put in a corner, you most likely will do the safest move. I can go from there and take control. Torterra is the glue of my team, for sure, holding me together from many threats. Every UU team needs a resident Grass-type as well, and IMO Torterra does this just as well as any. I chose to run Rock Slide over Stone Edge because Rock Slide still 2HKOs Altaria and OHKOs Moltres.</p>

<p>Jolly is probably sticking out to you like a sore thumb, but by god it works. My general rule of thumb is aldaron's: run 252 speed +speed nature on every offensive pokemon. All those Milotic with Ice Beam and 213 speed are useless with Jolly. A lot of pokemon can fall between 212-232 speed. It also helps for beating opposing Torterra to the punch. The power lost is definitely worth the extra speed I have. Since Torterra is so important to this team, it really helps not to be surprise KO'd by anything. Torterra has been a great addition to my team, and I suggest you try it (not really all my teams are weak to it!)</p>

<p><strong>Lanturn</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Volt Absorb<br />
EVs: 88 HP / 248 SpA / 172 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Charge Beamk<br />
- Surf<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Ice Beam</p>

<p>Yes that is a Lanturn you're looking at. Lanturn is really sexy in this metagame, with the abundance of F / W / G cores. Lanturn sets up on 2/3 of that core. It also ironically forms my own. Lanturn can bust through stall quite easily, surprisingly. It easily gets to +5 or 6 against Chansey via 101 subs, and the same goes for (Earthquake-less) Registeel. Lanturn gives me an amazing switch in to Rotom as well, who can trouble me to an extent with its ResTalk set. I choose to use Surf over Hydro Pump since its accuracy is rather middling, as well as its PP, and I get all the power I need from Surf. Lanturn also has a lot of synergy with the rest of my team. Moltres and Kabutops lure in Water-types, which let Lanturn set up and grab a couple kills. Same with Torterra and Fire-types. </p>

<p>I run the evs for a specific purpose. 172 speed allows me to beat all Adamant Torterra + anything beating Adamant Torterra. This is helpful vs Toxic / Ice Beam Milotic with speed for Torterra. 248 SAtk is because I am OCD and cannot stand to have 276 SAtk; it must be 275. 88 HP allows for 404 hp Subs, and just a little bulk to keep that Sub up. I am thinking of taking something like 76 or so EVs from Special Attack and throwing them into HP for more general survivability. I run all this Special Attack since Lanturn's Special attack is not good to start with, so I really need to just squeeze out every point of it that I can muster. With Ice Beam, he can also nail a surprise kill on some Grass-types. Tell me what you think of the HP evs, I am really contemplating it after a Uxie broke my sub with Psychic </p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/141.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Kabutops</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Swift Swim<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Aqua Jet<br />
- Rock Slide<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Rapid Spin</p>

<p>Best offensive spinner, hands down. Kabutops is an amazing offensive tool for keeping momentum. A lot of the time I can use Rapid Spin to fool them into thinking I don't have Swords Dance...only to pull it out late game and get a couple kills, opening up the game for my other sweepers. Kabutops gives me priority, which is so insanely helpful and appreciated. It helps me against rampaging Alakazam, Mismagius, and any other fast but frail sweeper that has somehow gotten out of control. I chose Rock Slide over Stone Edge because I feel that risking a(n often crucial!!) miss is not worth the slight loss in power. He still gets KOs that he needs to. The only thing I miss out on is defensive Venusaur and Milotic. Milotic is set up on in the face by Lanturn, so again no biggie. This is probably my biggest and best weapon against stall, since most sane people bring in stuff like Hitmontop or Torterra into Kabutops before they know the set, allowing me to spin whatever hazards they managed to put up. </p>

<p>I think I put Swords Dance on there because it was the only move I could think of that would be useful. Putting Stealth Rocks on Kabutops would often force me to have the painful decision of putting up SR or removing it from my side of the field; and besides, Registeel was a necessary part of my team, so I should probably just stick it there. Waterfall was the secondary option, but it never found much use. Obviously OHKOing Rhyperior and having a second reliable STAB is cool, but it would let Venusaur come in on me more easily, and I would probably have to end up with Stone Edge over Rock Slide. Swords Dance makes me a potent offensive threat, while Kabutops' typing and bulk let him switch in on a surprisingly large number of attacks a surprisingly large number of times! I needed a spinner who could pound the shit out of ghosts, and boy has Kabutops done that job admirably ^_^</p>

<p><strong>Moltres</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Air Slash<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Hidden Power Grass<br />
- Roost</p>

<p>Who are you going to call when you need to pound the shit out of everything? Moltres! Moltres has dropped really, really low, so I thought I should abuse the fact that people aren't preparing for him nearly as much (lots of 0 spdef milotic). Moltres can come in on a lot of pokemon (Spiritomb, Arcanine, Registeel, Venusaur to name a few) and just put the hurt on with Fire Blast. Moltres is often what I go to when I know i have a switch on my hands, because so many teams are unprepared. I can U-turn from Scyther to Moltres and force out the Ground- or Steel-type without doing anything except eating a U-turn, often double switching so that I am STILL in an advantageous position because they were forced to switch or die. Moltres is really key in breaking through the core of balance teams. Often, once I can nab a KO with Moltres' amazing power, I can exploit the hole he has created to bring in something they have a weakness to (e.g. killing a Donphan and then bringing Scyther in to U-turn spam) so that the hole gets bigger and bigger until their defenses are akin to wet tissue paper. It all has to start somewhere!</p>

<p>Moltres is great for patching up some holes in my team, however sometimes I feel like it is the weak link. Without it, Fighting-types would be big dicks to take down, and Grass-types would also be difficult to handle. I was considering Life Orb SubSplit Rotom (BEST SET EVER!), but that would really add to my weakness of Venusaur. I was also considering Life Orb Venusaur with some SAtk shifted to HP (maybe 56 or 76 evs) so I can take on some stuff better, but overall I am extremely happy with Moltres' amazing ability to punch holes like no other, while not being a glass cannon.</p>

<p><strong>Registeel</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Shadow Claw<br />
- Thunder Wave</p>

<p>This shit is like Elmer's. This is the defensive glue of my team, able to take on a myriad of threats that would otherwise destroy me. He also gets up Stealth Rock very reliably for me; in fact, the only time he really doesn't is when I have to bring him in on a Venusaur early game and eat a Sleep Powder, but generally I can get them up in a couple turns after I wake up. Careful max/max is absolutely necessary for withstanding the brunt of attacks this team takes. Mismagius, Alakazam, Rotom, whatever they throw out there this guy can take. I prefer Thunder Wave over Toxic for the ability to cripple sweepers that would otherwise prove troublesome. Toxic may be a better option since Rhyperior is such a huge dick, but otherwise it's cool. Seismic Toss, I find, is generally the most reliable way to do damage with Registeel, easily breaking the Subs of Uxie and doing consistent damage to sweepers (Houndoom is not coming in for free).</p>

<p>Shadow Claw, while odd, is for sure the best option on this set. Rotom kind of buttfucks me without it. I had lost a couple matches to SubSplit LO Rotom before I got off my ass and changed it. It does what it is supposed to do. I was never relying on Iron Head for consistent damage as it was; Seismic Toss was always my main form of damage. Shadow Claw is also awesome because it can 2HKO Mismagius, which is of utmost importance. If I am weakened, it will not get the chance to Nasty Plot up and get in 3 hits on me. I may just run Ice Punch to break Rotom's subs + nail Torterra + break Mismagius' subs, but the main problem with that is that I only 4HKO Mismagius or some shit like that which is dumb. Either way, Registeel is the best non-broken UU pokemon atm!!</p>
