[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and steals the target's item if the user is not holding one, unless they have the abilities Sticky Hold or Multitype, or is Giratina-O. In these cases it will only do damage with no added effect. If the user obtains a Life Orb, it takes recoil damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Thief has little competitive use. Its Base Power is rather low, and its secondary effect requires the user to forgo a hold item. This move is outclassed by Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo.</p>
