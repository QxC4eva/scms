[SHORT DESC]
No foe can use any of the user's moves.

[LONG DESC]
<p>No opponent can use any move that the user also knows. The effect is lost when the user switches out or faints. If the user shares no moves with any opponent at the time of use, Imprison fails. If the user gains new moves after using Imprison (through Mimic, Sketch, or Transform), those new moves are Imprisoned.</p>
