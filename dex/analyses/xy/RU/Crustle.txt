Overview
########

As a lead, Crustle faces stiff competition with just about every other lead such as Rhyperior, Cobalion, Registeel, Gligar, Accelgor, Qwilfish, Uxie, and Omastar. One feature that sets Crustle apart from the others is its access to Shell Smash, which can help it to beat Defoggers that will come in to clear its hazards. However, this does not set it apart from Omastar, Barbaracle, and Carracosta, all of whom receive Shell Smash. In BW it had access to the Custap Berry, but unfortunately it was dealt a losing hand in XY, as the Custap Berry is still unreleased. On the positive side, Crustle has relatively good Defense. It also has access to Sturdy, which almost guarantees at least one layer of hazards. On the negative side, Crustle has poor Special Attack and Speed, but requires maximum investment in both in order to KO Gligar with Hidden Power Ice. Its Special Defense isn't anything to brag about either, leaving it with a crippling weak spot.

Moves
========

Setting up multiple layers of Spikes is Crustle's main goal. Shell Smash allows Crustle to boost its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed, which are useful for KOing Defoggers that come in to clear off your Spikes. Stealth Rock can be used over Shell Smash, as HP Ice with the given EV spread can 2HKO Gligar after Stealth Rock, on the other hand Shell Smash allows Crustle to OHKO Gligar after a boost. A Rock-type STAB move allows Crustle to hit Defog variants of Golbat and Togetic. Rock Blast is better for dealing with Focus Sash Accelgor, which also commonly sets up Spikes, but Stone Edge can be used to ensure more power. X-Scissor can be used over Stone Edge to hit Shiftry super effectively, but it is not recommended unless you already have teammates that can hit other Defoggers, especially Golbat, which are more common.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes damage against Gligar, which will often come in to use Defog. Maximum Special Attack allows for a clean 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage, and an OHKO after a Shell Smash boost and Stealth Rock damage. The Mental Herb allows Crustle to evade Taunt, which is important in a tier filled with Taunters such as Cobalion, Drapion, Qwilfish, and Golbat, and especially ones with Prankser such as Mega Banette, Whimsicott, and Liepard. A Lum Berry is useful for the many status users in the tier that can hinder Crustle's ability to set Spikes up or KO Defoggers. Sturdy guarantees that Crustle can't be OHKOed, which, alongside the Mental Herb, almost ensures at least one layer of hazards.

Usage Tips
========

Make sure to set up entry hazards immediately, as not doing so could result in a wasted Mental Herb or losing Sturdy, and setting them up is Crustle's main priority. After Spikes are set up, your priority is to protect them. When using Shell Smash, don't leave Crustle vulnerable to being hit hard and revenge killed. Utilize switches to Defoggers, to KO them. It's possible to predict switches to Defoggers and hit them on the switch, allowing Crustle to 2HKO them.

Team Options
========

Crustle works well with Pokemon that can help keep its hazards up, such as spinblockers and Pokemon with Defiant. Pairing it with Ghost-types such as Doublade, Mega Banette, or Mismagius as well as Braviary can help you keep them up for a longer time. Many viable sweepers appreciate hazard support to assist their sweeps.

Other Options
########
When it comes to roles outside of a lead, Crustle can attempt use to Shell Smash and sweep, but it's not worth it when Gorebyss, Huntail, and Omastar can use Shell Smash as well, with the former two being able to pass their boosts and the latter being a far superior sweeper. A defensive Crustle set exists, but it is strongly not recommended as it is in no way a viable set.

Checks & Counters
########
**Cincinno**: The dreaded combination of Skill Link and Rock Blast allows Cincinno to manhandle Crustle, as it bypasses Sturdy by hitting five times and KOes easily.
**Rapid Spinners**: Kabutops makes quick work of Crustle, as it can hit Crustle with a super effective Waterfall or Stone Edge to activate Sturdy and KO with Rapid Spin, removing its hazards at the same time. Hitmonlee can do the same with High Jump Kick, as even without a type advantage it can bring Crustle down to one HP with one hit and KO it with Rapid Spin.
**Rhyperior**: Like Cincinno, Rhyperior often carries Rock Blast and can bypass Sturdy to OHKO Crustle, depending on how many times Rock Blast hits. It can also shrugs off Crustle's attacks thanks to Solid Rock. However, it is slower than Crustle and it requires a decent damage roll to OHKO it.
