[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that increases the Base Power of all Ghost-type moves by 20%. When held by a Pokemon with the Multitype ability, the holder's type will change to Ghost.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Ghost Arceus is amazingly versatile, capable of being splashed into many teams with any role one could possibly need. This isn't hard to see; Ghost-type STAB has excellent neutral coverage, and defensively it brings immunities to Normal- and Fighting-type moves, most notably Rapid Spin, making Ghost Arceus a staple on teams relying on entry hazards. It is also a deadly Calm Mind sweeper, gaining unresisted coverage with Judgment and Focus Blast, and can also dismantle most physical walls with a mighty Swords Dance set as well.</p>

<p>However, it is generally useless aside from Arceus, as most other Ghost-types find the power boost from Spooky Plate to be too menial.</p>

<h2>Location</h2> 
<p>Abyssal Ruins, 1F.</p>
