<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/142.png" alt="Aerodactyl" /></p>
<p><strong>Aerodactyl</strong></p>

<p>Type: Rock / Flying<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 105 Atk / 65 Def / 60 SpA / 75 SpD / 130 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>Aerodactyl's role as a lead in CAP is pretty much the same as it is in OU: prevent the opponent from setting up Stealth Rock and set your own Stealth Rock up. The only difference is that Aerodactyl has to compete with Stratagem for a lead slot. While Stratagem boasts better coverage and a higher offensive stat, Aerodactyl has one major advantage: Taunt. This makes Aerodactyl superior over Stratagem as a lead when your team has a couple of Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon. Aerodactyl also does well against Syclant and Pyroak leads, as it can threaten them with Stone Edge. However, Ice Shard Syclant will defeat Aerodactyl easily, while Stratagem causes Aerodactyl trouble due to it sharing the same Speed as Aerodactyl.</dd>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/487.png" alt="Azelf" /></p>
<p><strong>Azelf</strong></p>

<p>Type: Psychic<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 125 Atk / 70 Def / 125 SpA / 70 SpD / 115 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>Azelf is a great Stealth Rock and Taunt lead for offensive teams in the OU metagame and continues to be so in the CAP metagame. In CAP, however, Azelf faces new competition for the lead slot, though. Stratagem is much faster than Azelf, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock almost all the time, but it does lack a powerful Explosion that Azelf has access to. Syclant boasts a faster Taunt, a STAB priority move in the form of Ice Shard, access to high powered STAB moves, and fares better against the most common Pursuiters in Colossoil and Tyranitar, whom Azelf hate; but, Syclant lacks Stealth Rock in its movepool, so it generally uses Spikes instead. Azelf also sees some use as a late-game sweeper in CAP with its offensive sets, but Colossoil is now someone who Azelf needs to worry about. It's STAB Sucker Punch could easily defeat Azelf, while it can use Pursuit if it senses a switch; some even carry a Choice Scarf with Pursuit to instantly destroy Azelf. In most cases, Azelf is more commonly used as a lead, setting up Stealth Rock and Exploding out of harm's way.</dd>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/242.png" alt="Blissey" /></p>
<p><strong>Blissey</strong></p>

<p>Type: Normal<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
Base Stats: 255 HP / 10 Atk / 10 Def / 75 SpA / 135 SpD / 55 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Defensive</dt>
<dd>As one would expect, Blissey remains a staple on stall teams in CAP. Cyclohm and Stratagem will almost never be able to get through this cheerleader on their own. However, CAP has introduced Blissey's biggest fear: Colossoil. Colossoil can switch into almost any move, especially Toxic to gain a Guts boost, and use Pursuit to do away with Blissey. Blissey can also be set-up bait for other CAP Pokemon, particularly Fidgit and Revenankh. Fidgit fears only Ice Beam, and Revenankh doesn't care about anything that Blissey could possibly use. While players must watch out for these CAP Pokemon, her Wish support and ability to wall almost any special attacker remains as valuable as ever.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/286.png" alt="Breloom" /></p>
<p><strong>Breloom</strong></p>

<p>Type: Grass / Fighting<br />
Ability: Poison Heal<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 130 Atk / 80 Def / 60 SpA / 60 SpD / 70 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>Breloom has really lost its touch in the CAP metagame. From being a threatening Spore-using SubPuncher to a Pokemon that can rarely set up and sweep, Breloom won't be seeing as much use in CAP. The addition of Fidgit made it literally impossible for Breloom to set up, being immune to Spore via Vital Spirit and having access to Encore to stop Breloom from setting up. Kitsunoh's valuable typing offers it resistance and immunity to Breloom's Seed Bomb and Focus Punch, respectively, and can easily finish Breloom off with ShadowStrike. Revenankh can also set up multiple Bulk Ups with ease and wake up from Spore much faster due to its Shed Skin ability. The only thing Breloom has going for it is the fact that it is resistant to both of Colossoil's STAB attacks, but with Colossoil's impressive Attack stat (and access to Fire Blast), Breloom is still going to take a heavy blow.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/442.png" alt="Bronzong" /></p>
<p><strong>Bronzong</strong></p>

<p>Type: Steel / Psychic<br />
Abilities: Levitate<br />
Base Stats: 67 HP / 89 Atk / 116 Def / 79 SpA / 116 SpD / 33 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Defensive</dt>
<dd>Bronzong is hampered in many ways in the CAP metagame. Its lack of offense becomes glaringly obvious when Pyroak or Revenankh set up against it without the slightest worry, and its lack of recovery seriously hurts when facing Cyclohm or Colossoil. However, probably the most shattering difference in CAP is the fact that Bronzong is now forced to compete with Fidgit for a teamslot, who can use virtually every support move that Bronzong can, as well as several others like Spikes and Rapid Spin, better. Fidgit is quite possibly an even better transition Pokemon than Bronzong is as well, due to its great Speed and Encore. Despite all this, Bronzong is still a staple on many theme teams, such as Trick Room and Rain Dance.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/251.png" alt="Celebi" /></p>
<p><strong>Celebi</strong></p>

<p>Type: Psychic / Grass<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 100 Atk / 100 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 100 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>At a glance, Celebi is not the most obvious threat to the untrained eye. But after looking closer, it's actually difficult to see why Celebi wouldn't be a monster in a metagame where some of the most influential walls are defensive Water-types and many of the new Pokemon are weak to Psychic. Offensive Celebi can be extremely destructive with its well-rounded stats and ability to hit many key Pokemon, particularly defensive ones, for super effective damage. Life Orb Leaf Storm basically OHKOes everything that's weak to it, including Arghonaut and other bulky Waters, and Psychic rips into Fidgit and Revenankh for massive damage. Combined with coverage moves like Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire, switching into an offensive Celebi without losing a chunk of health or more can seem like a daunting task. This is not to say that Celebi doesn't have its good share of CAP-unique shortcomings. Kitsunoh can outrun even Timid Celebi, resists both of its STAB moves and can deal back loads of damage with ShadowStrike or U-turn. Colossoil can also situationally dispatch Celebi with Sucker Punch or Scarf U-turn, but non-Scarf Colossoil must tread very carefully, as Celebi outruns and can OHKO it with Leaf Storm or even Grass Knot.</dd>

<dt>Defensive</dt>
<dd>Celebi, as a defensive Pokemon, remains a common sight even in the CAP metagame for a myriad of reasons. Its fantastic all-around bulk and access to a plethora of support moves allow it to be used for a variety of purposes, whether it be an all-around counter that relies on its ability to survive hits miraculously and cripple the opponent with Thunder Wave, or its ability to support the team with Reflect and shuffle through the opponent's team with Perish Song. Celebi can also take better advantage of its Psychic typing in the CAP metagame. STAB Psychic allows a defensive Celebi to deal a surprisingly large amount of damage to threats that may otherwise set up on it, such as Revenankh and Fidgit (though one must be wary of Encore). Unfortunately, this is where the story goes sour, as the green onion has to deal with many increased dangers unique to the CAP metagame. Kitsunoh is immune to Thunder Wave (assuming it uses Limber) and can easily 2HKO Celebi with its STAB moves. Colossoil can outrun defensive Celebi and deal heavy damage with its STAB moves or U-turn. Worst of all, Syclant can threaten to OHKO Celebi with Bug Buzz / Megahorn and grab a free turn to set up Tail Glow / Swords Dance as Celebi switches out.</dd>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/149.png" alt="Dragonite" /></p>
<p><strong>Dragonite</strong></p>

<p>Type: Dragon / Flying<br />
Ability: Inner Focus<br />
Stats: 91 HP / 134 Atk / 95 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 80 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>Dragonite has become mostly unseen in the CAP metagame because of it being replaced by Salamence. Dragonite is mostly seen in the lead position, abusing its great mixed offenses and ExtremeSpeed, which helps it beat out many other CAP leads, such as Stratagem and Pyroak. However, Ice Shard Syclant gives Dragonite an extreme amount of difficulty. Cyclohm is also someone who Dragonite needs to fight for a teamslot with. It has same Speed stat as Dragonite, carries a much more threatening Draco Meteor off of its base 112 Special Attack, no weakness to Stealth Rock, a substantially more useful ability in Shield Dust, and more physical bulk. Dragonite's main advantage over Cyclohm is the fact that it carries a Ground-type immunity, a very common attacking type in the CAP metagame.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/398.png" alt="Empoleon" /></p>
<p><strong>Empoleon</strong></p>

<p>Type: Water / Steel<br />
Ability: Torrent<br />
Base Stats: 84 HP / 86 Atk / 88 Def / 111 SpA / 101 SpD / 60 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>While still a very powerful sweeper once it sets up, Empoleon faces a large obstacle in the CAP metagame: Arghonaut. With Unaware, it ignores Empoleon's potential Petaya boost and can take pretty much any one of its unboosted attacks, bar a Life Orb Grass Knot. However, Arghonaut's presence is largely limited to defensive teams, and it can usually be cleared away through the same methods that Empoleon's other common counters, such as Blissey and Snorlax, can be cleared out. As in OU, once its counters have been cleared away or weakened, Empoleon is extremely efficient at plowing through an enemy team with only one turn needed to Agility and solidify its sweep.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/330.png" alt="Flygon" /></p>
<p><strong>Flygon</strong></p>

<p>Type: Ground / Dragon<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 100 Atk / 80 Def / 80 SpA / 80 SpD / 100 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>In the CAP metagame, Flygon is aided by a fantastic U-turn partner: Kitsunoh. Kitsunoh and Flygon resist all of each other's weaknesses, and between them, resist fourteen of the seventeen types. Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends; with the popularity of defensive walls in CAP, Flygon users find that it just doesn't always hit hard enough to get the job done, and while Kitsunoh is an excellent partner to it, Kitsunoh is also one of Flygon's best checks. Arghonaut will coolly take any move Flygon can dish out; even ThunderPunch can't be expected to 2HKO. On top of that, Flygon is set-up bait for many common CAP threats, such as Revenankh and Gyarados. Flygon still most commonly appears with a Choice Band or a Choice Scarf, using U-turn, Earthquake, and Outrage; just don't expect Flygon to be half as useful as it is in OU.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/205.png" alt="Forretress" /></p>
<p><strong>Forretress</strong></p>

<p>Type: Bug / Steel<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
Stats: 75 HP / 90 Atk / 140 Def / 60 SpA / 60 SpD / 40 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Defensive</dt>
<dd>Forretress's physical bulk is still formidable in the CAP metagame, although it is under constant pressure from Fidgit to find its way onto a team in terms of laying down entry hazards. Also, it has been almost completely usurped as a Rapid Spinner by both Fidgit and Colossoil, who arguably pull off Rapid Spin with much more success. Forretress also finds more opponents in CAP than in OU who find Forretress set-up bait, especially Revenankh and Pyroak, who can set up Bulk Up and Dragon Dance, respectively. Despite that, Forretress has one thing going for it as a Rapid Spinner that Fidgit and Colossoil somewhat lack: the ability to overcome Syclant. Gyro Ball Forretress can easily stop a Swords Dance / Tail Glow Syclant's sweep due to its resistance to both of its STAB moves; however, Forretress should be wary of Hidden Power Fire in Tail Glow Syclant's case.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/94.png" alt="Gengar" /></p>
<p><strong>Gengar</strong></p>

<p>Type: Ghost / Poison<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
Stats: 60 HP / 65 Atk / 60 Def / 130 SpA / 75 SpD / 110 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>Gengar is still the potent Life Orb sweeper that it always was, but in the CAP metagame, it now faces new threats that can put it down for good with little effort. Colossoil stands atop these threats, easily forcing a mind game against Gengar with Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Colossoil also carries Choice Scarf sometimes, easily putting an end to Gengar's life with Pursuit. Due to the presence of Colossoil, most Gengar have Substitute in their moveset to scout for Colossoil switch-ins to eliminate them with Focus Blast. Another common problem with Gengar is that its 110 base Speed can force a Speed tie with Kitsunoh, who shares the same base Speed, has a neutrality to Gengar's Shadow Ball, and threatens Gengar with ShadowStrike. Both Stratagem and Syclant are faster than non-Choice Scarfed Gengar and can threaten to KO Gengar with their powerful STAB attacks. Revenankh, albeit weak to Gengar's Shadow Ball, has enough Special Defense to withstand Gengar's attacks and could end Gengar easily with its Shadow Sneak. All of these shortcomings greatly affected Gengar as a sweeper and is generally not as effective as it is in the OU metagame.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/477.png" alt="Gliscor" /></p>
<p><strong>Gliscor</strong></p>

<p>Type: Ground / Flying<br />
Abilities: Sand Veil / Hyper Cutter<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 95 Atk / 125 Def / 45 SpA / 75 SpD / 95 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Defensive</dt>
<dd>In CAP, Gliscor is rarely used as a supporter, simply because Fidgit is probably the best supporting Ground-type that has ever existed. Instead, Gliscor often uses an anti-stall set with Taunt, Toxic, and Roost. This set has been known to beat Arghonaut, even with Ice Punch (because Roost temporarily alleviates the double weakness) as well as being immensely useful against Revenankh. If Fidgit tries to switch in to absorb Toxic, as it loves to do to use Encore, it risks getting hit by an Earthquake or a Taunt, either one practically forcing Fidgit to switch back out. Alternately, some Gliscor will try to Baton Pass both Swords Dance and Agility, usually to Metagross, as Metagross is one of the few Pokemon that can defeat Arghonaut with Zen Headbutt. Two changes in CAP that have reduced Gliscor's usage are the reduction in Lucario and its replacement by Gyarados, though it should be noted that Gliscor is an acceptable counter to Colossoil, Revenankh, and Metagross.</dd> 
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/130.png" alt="Gyarados" /></p>
<p><strong>Gyarados</strong></p>

<p>Type: Water / Flying<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 125 Atk / 79 Def / 60 SpA / 100 SpD / 81 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>Gyarados is even more useful in the CAP metagame than it is in the OU metagame. Being one of the best counters to Fidgit and Colossoil guarantees that Gyarados is easy to switch in and set up Dragon Dances. Just like in OU, playing Gyarados revolves around using Dragon Dance and boosted Waterfalls. Because of Arghonaut (who negates Gyarados' Dragon Dance boosts due to Unaware) and Revenankh, Gyarados usually runs Bounce in tandem with Waterfall. The last move varies; Taunt helps considerably against Vaporeon, Arghonaut, and Celebi, but Earthquake ensures that Cyclohm (who resists Water and Flying) doesn't wall you. While most Gyarados are Adamant, Jolly can be used as it outpaces Stratagem after one Dragon Dance.</dd>

<dt>Defensive</dt>
<dd>RestTalk Gyarados deals with many big CAP threats, most notably Colossoil. It can also Roar away Bulk Up Revenankh with ease. Unfortunately, Gyarados faces stiff competition with one CAP Pokemon: Arghonaut. Arghonaut is an excellent defensive bulky Water with Roar and Recover, and is resistant to Stealth Rock. Gyarados must be aware of Fidgit, who can come in on Gyarados as it uses Rest or Sleep Talk, and cripple it with Encore. Gyarados can function well by simply giving it Taunt and a bulky EV spread; however, this set doesn't last as long as RestTalk Gyarados. Despite that, it still checks the threats that it needs to without being terribly reduced as an offensive threat.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/490.png" alt="Heatran" /></p>
<p><strong>Heatran</strong></p>

<p>Type: Fire / Steel<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
Base Stats: 91 HP / 90 Atk / 106 Def / 130 SpA / 106 SpD / 77 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>Choice Scarf Heatran continues to be a menace in the CAP metagame. With its ability to threaten an OHKO against Kitsunoh and Syclant (who also resists both of their STAB attacks), it can force them to switch out immediately. It also fares well against many other CAP Pokemon, being able to revenge kill Fidgit, Cyclohm, and even non-Scarfed Colossoil if they've taken a bit of prior damage. However, all of these Pokemon have the ability to KO Heatran with their attacks as well, so a bit of prediction goes a long way. Heatran also resists the dual STAB combination of Pyroak and threatens it with a possible Flash Fire-boosted Fire Blast if Pyroak lacks its own Flash Fire. Arghonaut can switch into any attack, including Hidden Power Grass, and be at most 3HKOed, and return with a KO against Heatran with Waterfall. Not even Heatran's Explosion can OHKO it unless Arghonaut has taken substantial prior damage. Even worse than Arghonaut is Revenankh, as it turns Heatran into Bulk Up setup fodder since it can, at best, 4HKO Revenankh with an unboosted Fire Blast. Despite the new threats it faces, Heatran continues to be a significant threat in the CAP metagame, enough so that every team must be able to handle it somehow or risk being destroyed.</dd>

<dt>Defensive</dt>
<dd>With excellent defenses and part Steel typing, Heatran can be used very well as a defensive Pokemon. Heatran has two main defensive sets: the Rest + Sleep Talk set and the Torment set. Though still being able to threaten the same Pokemon in CAP as it does in OU, it has many new threats to handle in CAP. Colossoil, who can easily switch into Lava Plume without fearing the potential burn due to its Guts ability, can threaten Heatran with Earthquake; however, Torment Heatran can generally handle most Colossoil under a Substitute. Arghonaut, while fearing burns, can still break Torment sets as well as Rest + Sleep Talk variants, and Revenankh can easily set up Bulk Ups in front of defensive Heatran with ease.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/455.png" alt="Hippowdon" /></p>
<p><strong>Hippowdon</strong></p>

<p>Type: Ground<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
Base Stats: 108 HP / 112 Atk / 118 Def / 68 SpA / 72 SpD / 47 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Defensive</dt>
<dd>Hippowdon fares very well against some of CAP's unique threats, such as Fidgit, Colossoil, Revenankh, and Kitsunoh, but the increased usage of Pyroak has often resulted in Hippowdon being shafted aside on stall teams to make room for a Dragon-type. On top of that, Hippowdon has problems dealing with the increased usage of Taunt in general and the abundant use of Gyarados. However, Hippowdon still remains as one of the better physical walls and among the most reliable Stealth Rock users in the CAP metagame.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/395.png" alt="Infernape" /></p>
<p><strong>Infernape</strong></p>

<p>Type: Fire / Fighting<br />
Ability: Blaze<br />
Stats: 76 HP / 104 Atk / 71 Def / 104 SpA / 71 SpD / 108 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>Infernape functions in the CAP metagame much like it does within OU, mostly seen as mixed sweeper to break down walls. It's also commonly used as a lead, being able to come out on top of opposing Stratagem and Syclant (that lack Ice Shard) leads. However, Infernape faces some new opponents to overcome, particularly Arghonaut and Revenankh. Arghonaut's great overall bulk helps it deal with Infernape considerably well, destroying it with its STAB Waterfall. Revenankh, who is immune to Infernape's Close Combat, has fantastic Special Defense, which helps it take Fire Blasts and Overheats with little to no trouble. Colossoil's huge Attack stat actually causes a great deal of damage to Infernape when it uses Sucker Punch, which is why most Infernape tend to carry Mach Punch to avoid being picked off by Colossoil.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/385.png" alt="Jirachi" /></p>
<p><strong>Jirachi</strong></p>

<p>Type: Steel / Psychic<br />
Ability: Serene Grace<br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 100 Atk / 100 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 100 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>Jirachi's versatility is limited in CAP compared to OU. Substitute + Calm Mind sets will always run into problems with Fidgit, who can switch into any move except Psychic and use Encore to stop Jirachi's setup. Apart from Fidgit, there's the fact that Jirachi cannot get adequate coverage with two moves in CAP: Thunderbolt + Psychic is unable to damage Colossoil, while using Thunderbolt + Flash Cannon renders you unable to hit Cyclohm or Pyroak for neutral damage and removes your ability to seriously harm Revenankh and Fidgit. Kitsunoh is typically preferred as a Choice Scarf or Choice Band user, as it hits harder and outruns Salamence, not to mention its excellent abilities. Cyclohm is a perfect counter to any Choice Scarf Jirachi set, as it is immune to secondary effects, thanks to Shield Dust, and is never 2HKOed by Ice Punch. When physical Jirachi is used, you can be almost certain it will carry Zen Headbutt, as this makes Jirachi one of the best answers to Revenankh, as well as allowing it to easily flinch Arghonaut and Fidgit to death.</dd>

<dt>Defensive</dt>
<dd>Jirachi usually plays a supporting role in CAP. Thunder Wave is more common than it is in OU, as Cyclohm has no fear of Body Slam's paralysis chance due to its Shield Dust ability. However, Body Slam is still used, as it comes as a nasty surprise for incoming Fidgit. Sadly, neither of these moves will affect Limber Kitsunoh, another common answer to Jirachi. The majority of defensive Jirachi stick to using Wish and other supporting moves, such as Stealth Rock, dual screens, and even Rain Dance.</dd>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/135.png" alt="Jolteon" /></p>
<p><strong>Jolteon</strong></p>

<p>Type: Electric<br />
Ability: Volt Absorb<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 65 Atk / 60 Def / 110 SpA / 95 SpD / 130 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>In OU, Jolteon is easily Pursuit bait for Tyranitar, but in CAP, Jolteon faces a new Pursuit-using nemesis: Colossoil. With Colossoil's immunity and resistance to Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball, respectively, Jolteon's ability to sweep with Choice Specs has greatly dropped in successfulness; it needs to catch Colossoil on the switch with Hidden Power Ice or Grass, but even then, Colossoil can survive the assault and force a mind game with Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Fidgit also caused Jolteon big problems, as it can set up multiple entry hazards once Jolteon locks itself into Thunderbolt. On top of that, with Revenankh boasting excellent Special Defense, it's not hard for it to set up several Bulk Ups and finish Jolteon off with Shadow Sneak.</dd> 
</dl>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/230.png" alt="Kingdra" /></p>
<p><strong>Kingdra</strong></p>

<p>Type: Water / Dragon<br />
Ability: Swift Swim<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 95 Atk / 95 Def / 95 SpA / 95 SpD / 85 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>Kingdra is a pretty potent threat in the CAP metagame. Its Water and Dragon STAB combo continue their amazing coverage, still only resisted by Empoleon, while scoring super effective damage against Fidgit, Stratagem, Cyclohm and Colossoil. Kingdra has also gotten some new Rain Dance supporters in Fidgit and Cyclohm, both of whom can set up Rain Dance with general ease and, in Cyclohm's case, abuse it effectively. However, Arghonaut is arguably the best switch-in to Dragon Dance Kingdra. Its Unaware ability negates all Dragon Dance boosts, making Kingdra's Outrage unlikely to 2HKO it. Revenankh could also use Bulk Up as Kingdra attempts to gather Dragon Dances, meaning Revenankh wins in the end via Shadow Sneak.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/453.png" alt="Lucario" /></p>
<p><strong>Lucario</strong></p>

<p>Type: Fighting / Steel<br />
Ability: Inner Focus<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 110 Atk / 70 Def / 115 SpA / 70 SpD / 90 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>Lucario is known for its Swords Dance sets; the ability to pick off faster foes with ExtremeSpeed combined with the raw power behind Close Combat has always been considered devastating. However, in the CAP metagame, this is considerably reduced. Kitsunoh can always switch into Lucario and OHKO it with Superpower or burn it with Will-O-Wisp, Arghonaut ignores the Swords Dance boost due to its Unaware ability, Revenankh is immune to Lucario's main physical attacks, and Fidgit, Stratagem, and Colossoil all outpace it, and can take a +2 ExtremeSpeed, and finish it off with their Ground-type attacks. Lucario is definitely a frightening sweeper, but with the way most of the CAPs can check or counter it, expect to see less of it than you would in the OU metagame.</dd>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/68.png" alt="Machamp" /></p>
<p><strong>Machamp</strong></p>

<p>Type: Fighting<br />
Ability: No Guard<br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 130 Atk / 80 Def / 65 SpA / 85 SpD / 55 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Offensive</dt>
<dd>While Machamp is famously difficult to switch into in OU, the four-armed fighter actually has quite a few problems within the CAP metagame, all of which are a direct result of the added Pokemon. Revenankh and Kitsunoh are immune to DynamicPunch and take only neutral damage from Payback. Revenankh is bulky enough to set up on Machamp, while Kitsunoh can deal lots of damage with ShadowStrike or burn it with Will-O-Wisp, so that Payback fails to break its Substitutes. Fidgit is bulky enough to switch into Machamp using its Fighting resist and wall it, the confusion being a minor hindrance. Cyclohm doesn't even resist Fighting, but it completely ignores DynamicPunch's confusion effect through its Shield Dust ability, and defensive Cyclohm is bulky enough to not be 2HKOed. Despite losing a lot of ground due to the presence of the new Pokemon, Machamp is still a powerful Pokemon, and it actually holds a niche within the CAP metagame as a fairly good response to the extremely dangerous Stratagem. Machamp resists Stratagem's Rock STAB, is bulky enough to survive almost any other attack, and can OHKO back with DynamicPunch.</dd>

<dd>Magnezone's usage is widely diminished in the CAP metagame. Scizor and Forretress are much rarer in CAP than in OU, rendering Hidden Power Fire nearly worthless. Skarmory still often carries a Shed Shell (though some have switched to Leftovers because of Magnezone's drop) and Metagross often uses Agility on the turn Magnezone takes to switch in. Amongst the CAP Pokemon, only Kitsunoh is Steel-typed, but Magnezone should never try to switch into it because it can potentially switch into Earthquake or Superpower. Choice Scarf Magnezone is therefore much more common than any other Magnezone set, but the opportunities to revenge KO sweepers are very low; Lucario and Scizor are unpopular, and most of CAP's other big threats, like Stratagem, Starmie, and Gyarados (after a Dragon Dance boost), will outrun it. The big problem with Magnezone is that it tends to be serious set-up bait: Revenankh, Pyroak, Fidgit, Cyclohm, and Colossoil can all be switched in without any trouble.</dd>

<dd>Metagross is one of the most dangerous and metagame-shaping Pokemon within CAP, mainly due to a combination of very advantageous stats and its access to a powerful Zen Headbutt. While its physically-attacking Steel-type counterpart, Scizor, has trouble with Pokemon like Arghonaut, Fidgit and Revenankh, Metagross can simply smash its way through with its Psychic-STAB, which is actually capable of OHKOing many variants of the three when backed up by a Life Orb. It also possesses high physical bulk to the point where even an offensive Metagross has little trouble switching into the common physical attacks of Arghonaut and Revenankh. Along with the common lead sets, there are generally two types of Metagross sets that are used in CAP, and both of them usually have Zen Headbutt. One of them is a bulky attacker that invests in HP and is designed to take hits and potentially remove counters to other Pokemon by Exploding. The other is Life Orb Zen Headbutt AgiliGross, which has become among the most fearsome and difficult to stop late-game sweepers in the CAP metagame. This notably leaves it more vulnerable to Skarmory, who has become increasingly useful as a CAP Metagross response.</dd>

<dd>Roserade plays nearly the exact same role in both the OU and CAP metagame: put someone to sleep and set up Toxic Spikes. However, Roserade is one of the few OU Pokemon that must now compete with Fidgit for entry hazard support, and is generally losing ground in terms of usage as a result. Not only does Roserade have to compete with Fidgit for a teamslot, but Fidgit is also one of Roserade's greatest fears on the battlefield. Fidgit's Vital Spirit ability makes it immune to Roserade's Sleep Powder, can absorb Toxic Spikes with its Poison typing, and can Encore one of Roserade's moves that don't affect it as much. Despite that, Roserade's impressive Special Attack, STAB Leaf Storm, and Sleep Powder are the only things that Roserade has going for it that Fidgit doesn't, which is just enough to keep Roserade usable in the CAP metagame.</dd>

<dd>The addition of Colossoil in the CAP metagame has severely crippled Rotom-A's effectiveness; Colossoil is literally a surefire counter to any Rotom forme. An immunity to Thunderbolt and a resistance to Shadow Ball keeps Rotom-A from using a Choice item, as being locked into one of those moves invites Colossoil onto the battlefield to finish Rotom-A off. Rotom-C and Rotom-W are rising in usage, being more common than Rotom-H in the OU metagame, specifically because of Colossoil's presence. Also, Rotom-A are now using Substitute to scout for Colossoil switch-ins to hit it with their super effective signature moves, as well as preventing Sucker Punch from working.</dd> 

<dt>Defensive</dt>
<dd>The most common Rotom-A formes in CAP are Rotom-C and Rotom-W, primarily due to the presence of Colossoil. Colossoil has forced many users to run Rotom-A with Leaf Storm or Hydro Pump, even on their defensive sets, to hit Colossoil super effectively. While Rotom-A does enjoy popularity on stall teams for the ability to block Rapid Spin, he faces newfound competition in Revenankh and Kitsunoh. Rotom-A must be wary of using Will-O-Wisp as well, because Colossoil can easily take the burn for a Guts boost and threaten back with Pursuit.</dd>

<dd>Scizor has really lost its touch in the CAP metagame. From being a great scout with U-turn and revenge killer with Bullet Punch, Scizor's effectiveness has significantly dropped, which is directly because of the CAP Pokemon. Kitsunoh is capable of being immune or resistant to nearly all of Scizor's commonly used moves, and can proceed to cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, while Revenankh can easily set up multiple Bulk Ups or burn Scizor with Will-O-Wisp as well. Arghonaut basically makes it impossible for Scizor to attempt a Swords Dance sweep, due to its Unaware ability negating the Swords Dance boost, and finally, with Cyclohm's great physical bulk and resistance to Bullet Punch, it is capable of eliminating Scizor with Flamethrower. Scizor does, however, have its uses against Syclant and Stratagem, as Scizor is one of the most common revenge killers to both of these big threats.</dd>

<dd>Shaymin, while not as common in OU, has some major advantages in the CAP metagame. Pyroak and Colossoil are great at removing the dreaded Steel-type Pokemon that resist Shaymin's Seed Flare and Air Slash, which makes them common partners to Shaymin to give it an easier time sweeping. Grass is a great attacking type in CAP, hitting Arghonaut, Colossoil, and Stratagem for super effective damage, while Air Slash, a common secondary attack that Shaymin uses, hits Revenankh, Pyroak, and Syclant super effectively. Unfortunately, Shaymin must catch both Stratagem and Syclant on the switch with Seed Flare and Air Slash, respectively, or else they can threaten to KO Shaymin with their own super effective attacks. Cyclohm is a common Shaymin combatant, as it resists both of Shaymin's aforementioned attacks and can hit back with a super effective Flamethrower; however, most Shaymin run Earth Power to deal a hefty amount of damage to Cyclohm. The use of Earth Power also helps Shaymin hit Kitsunoh and Fidgit super effectively, though Shaymin should be cautious of Kitsunoh's Ice Punch.</dd>

<dd>On balanced teams, Fidgit competes with Skarmory for the position of setting up Spikes, but it doesn't have the survivability level to be the main Spikes user on stall teams, meaning Skarmory is still a staple. Skarmory must be cautious of opposing Fidgit, however, as it can Encore almost any of Skarmory's moves and then Rapid Spin away the laid down entry hazards. Pyroak and Cyclohm are bad news for Skarmory as well with their super effective STAB attacks, but Skarmory is one of the prime counters to Revenankh, and can set up against Arghonaut and Kitsunoh (who lack Taunt) too, provided that Kitsunoh doesn't get too many Defense drops via ShadowStrike. Skarmory is a risky counter to Colossoil, as many of them carry Taunt, Fire Blast, or Selfdestruct, but any Colossoil lacking one of those moves will be helplessly stuck against Skarmory. Many Skarmory have taken to running Taunt, simply because it is an amazingly useful move in CAP.</dd>

<dd>Smeargle functions largely the same in CAP as it does in OU, although its usage is greatly hindered by the more popular Fidgit, who can arguably lay down entry hazards better than Smeargle, despite the lack of Spore, and has much better stats, typing, and ability in every aspect. Fidgit is also immune to and can switch in on Smeargle's Spore due to its ability, Vital Spirit, and strike Smeargle with Encore, which will keep Smeargle from setting up hazards. As a result, more Smeargle tend to use Trick to cripple Fidgit with a Choice Scarf to set up entry hazards without fearing Fidgit's Encore as much. While uncommon, Smeargle leads will still arise from time to time and use their rarity as an advantage for unpredictability.</dd>

<dd>With its high base 110 Attack stat coupled with its amazing 160 HP and 110 Special Defense stats, Snorlax is a serious threat to watch out for. Its powerful paralysis-inducing Body Slam is feared by many CAP Pokemon, especially Stratagem, Colossoil, and Fidgit. Cyclohm and Kitsunoh will take a hefty hit from Earthquake, while Pyroak and Arghonaut will be brought down by an insanely powerful Selfdestruct. Although, Snorlax does need to look out for Kitsunoh's Superpower and Arghonaut's Low Kick, as they will deal severe damage to it. One of the biggest challenges Snorlax faces in the CAP metagame, however, is Revenankh. Its immunity to Snorlax's STAB attacks and ability to set up Bulk Ups easily against it makes Revenankh an impassable force against Snorlax. For this reason, many Snorlax tend to carry Zen Headbutt to deal with Revenankh to some extent, as well as hitting Arghonaut super effectively.</dd>

<dd>While keeping its status as a fast and powerful sweeper who can potentially Rapid Spin as well, Starmie is well suited to severely damage most CAP Pokemon, scoring an OHKO on Fidgit and Kitsunoh with a Life Orbed Hydro Pump, and Cyclohm with Ice Beam. Though it may still hit hard, the addition of Revenankh made Starmie less competent in Rapid Spinning, but Starmie is still completely viable as a Spinner. Colossoil's Sucker Punch and Pursuit combination will force Starmie to a mind game, making Colossoil somewhat difficult to deal with once it switches in safely, not to mention that Choice Scarf variants will easily finish Starmie off with Pursuit.

Being part Ground gives Swampert a powerful Earthquake, an immunity to sandstorm, and an immunity to Electric. This makes Swampert more capable of stopping certain sweepers, such as Cyclohm and Metagross.

<dd>Togekiss is a potent threat in the CAP metagame. With many of the CAP Pokemon taking super effective damage from Togekiss' Air Slash, such as Pyroak, Revenankh, and Arghonaut, Togekiss can simply abuse it to great potential. However, Togekiss has its faults against the other CAP Pokemon, particularly Cyclohm and Kitsunoh. Cyclohm is the biggest threat Togekiss will have to encounter. Since its ability, Shield Dust, prevents Togekiss' Air Slash from flinching and having access to a super effective Thunderbolt, Togekiss will be beaten fast. Kitsunoh is another large threat to Togekiss, as its Limber ability and resistance and immunity to Air Slash and Aura Sphere, respectively, instantly puts Togekiss in a tight spot. Setting up with Togekiss is also not as easy in CAP than in OU. Due to the presence of Fidgit, it can switch into Togekiss as it uses Thunder Wave, Roost, or Nasty Plot, use Encore, and score some free entry hazards as Togekiss is forced to switch out.</dd>

<dd>Faced with a new nemesis, Arghonaut, and the fact that it now must compete for a team slot with Colossoil, who carries out many of Tyranitar's traditional tasks more fluidly, Tyranitar can be described as a victim of circumstance within the CAP metagame. Having a massive Attack stat, multiple stat-boosting moves, and great defensive prowess doesn't seem as good when you realize that most defensive teams are equipped with an almost perfect counter to it, and that Colossoil is faster and can take status with ease. Many of Tyranitar's famous sets from OU, such as Choice Band and Dragon Dance, have been deemed inefficient and obsolete in this harsh new metagame. The story isn't all bad for Tyranitar, however. Sand Stream remains an exceptionally useful ability, and Tyranitar has gained a new role as a partner to Stratagem, who becomes even more dangerous with a Special Defense boost. This boost also allows Tyranitar to become a more reliable answer to Latias than Colossoil, who often has to resort to a Sucker Punch/Pursuit gamble in which it risks getting hit by a Life Orb Surf. Tyranitar in CAP is usually seen as a lead, and it will often be found using elemental attacking sets that set it apart from Colossoil as a counter-breaker with its huge movepool. A lot of teams choose to run both Tyranitar and Colossoil, as the two are deceptively capable of weakening each others' counters.</dd>

Vaporeon commonly seen running Hidden Power Electric, as the abundant use of Gyarados in the CAP metagame is a huge threat and often runs Taunt to stop Vaporeon from using Wish or Protect. However, Vaporeon does make a relatively good Colossoil switch-in thanks to its decent physical bulk and access to STAB Surf. The drop in Vaporeon is surely attributable to the rise of Arghonaut, whose Unaware ability allows it to stop many more threats than Vaporeon.</dd>

<dd>Zapdos faces many new challenges in CAP. Syclant and Stratagem can both outrun it and OHKO with their super effective STAB attacks; Fidgit is by far Zapdos's worst enemy, because it can absorb most of its moves and use Encore; Cyclohm resists all of the moves of the typical three-attack set used in OU, aside from Hidden Power Ice, and use Draco Meteor. However, Zapdos is possibly Arghonaut's worst nightmare, and isn't such a bad switch-in to Kitsunoh and Colossoil, either. Many Zapdos are choosing to run Hidden Power Ice because of Fidgit, Cyclohm, and the increased sightings of Latias. Occasionally, Zapdos runs Hidden Power Flying to damage Pyroak and Revenankh.</dd>

<dt>Defensive</dt>
<dd>Zapdos' threats in the CAP metagame tend to be more specially inclined. Stratagem, Syclant, and Cyclohm can all KO Zapdos with their STAB attacks if given the chance. For this reason, any defensive Zapdos in the CAP metagame tend to focus more on Special Defense to better handle the aforementioned threats. However, even with heavy investment in Special Defense, Stealth Rock still leaves Zapdos to be OHKOed by Stratagem and Syclant. The most problematic Pokemon defensive Zapdos would ever encounter is Fidgit, who can easily switch into Thunderbolt, Roost, Toxic, or Substitute (or any other weaker attack for that matter) and cripple Zapdos with Encore; this gives Fidgit a great opportunity to set up entry hazards. Despite those problems, Zapdos is still capable of defeating Arghonaut, while also still being a decent switch-in to Kitsunoh and Colossoil. But on the whole, defensive Zapdos loses much of its effectiveness in CAP and is not as common as it is in OU.</dd>
