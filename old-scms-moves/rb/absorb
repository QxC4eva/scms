<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The user recovers HP equal to half of the damage dealt to the opponent, rounded down.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Absorb's damage output is pathetic and any HP regained is minuscule. If your Pokemon can use Mega Drain, use that; otherwise, any other Grass-type move is essentially better in every respect.</p>
