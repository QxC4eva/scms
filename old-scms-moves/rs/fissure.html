[SHORT DESC]
Will OHKO the target.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Does damage equal to the target's max HP. If the target uses Endure, it will leave them with 1 HP. If Lock-On or Mind Reader has been used the previous turn, Fissure will hit. Fissure ignores all other Accuracy and Evasion modifiers, but instead has its own accuracy formula.

<code><var>Accuracy</var> = ((<var>U</var>â€”<var>T</var>) + 30) / 100</code>

<dl>
<dt>U</dt>
<dd>Level of the user</dd>

<dt>T</dt>
<dd>Level of the target</dd>
</dl>

Fissure fails if the user's level is less than the target's level.
