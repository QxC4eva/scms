Puts the target to sleep.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Puts the target to sleep. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Pokemon with the abilities Insomnia or Vital Spirit are immune. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sing has little competitive use. While the sleep status is powerful, Sing's accuracy is awful, and too unreliable in most situations. However, there are times when the risk of missing with Sing is worth it. The best example is with an extremely bulky Pokemon like Blissey; Blissey forces nearly every special attacker out, meaning Blissey will have a lot of chances to hit the incoming Pokemon with Sing and usually permanently cripple it thanks to BW's sleep mechanics.</p>
