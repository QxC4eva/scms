<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Paralyzes the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>It might not have the best accuracy out there, but Stun Spore is a decent attack. Unlike Thunder Wave, no single elemental type is immune to Grass. Thanks to that attribute, Stun Spore can paralyze every Pokemon in the game. The best user is Exeggutor, who can spread paralysis easily thanks to its bulk and typing.</p>
