<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Recovers 50% of the user's max HP. This move will fail if the user's HP is full, has 511 below max HP, 255 below max HP, or no HP.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Softboiled is one of the best moves in the game, and it, or its equivalent Recover, is mandatory for any defensive Pokemon and even some offensive ones. Chansey is the only user this move, walling special attacks and even physical attacks with Reflect, recovering all damage received. A Chansey without Softboiled should be frowned upon and discarded.</p>
