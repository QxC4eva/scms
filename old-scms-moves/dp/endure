[SHORT DESC]
The user always survives with at least 1 HP.

[LONG DESC]
<p>No attack will faint the user. If an attack would have done enough damage to cause the user to faint, it instead leaves them with 1 HP. If the user successfully used Detect, Endure, or Protect on the previous turn, Endure only has a 50% chance to work successfully. The effect lasts until the end of the turn.</p>
