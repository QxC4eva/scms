<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/384.png" alt="Rayquaza" /><br />
Rayquaza @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Air Lock<br />
EVs: 42 Atk / 216 Spd / 252 SAtk<br />
Naive nature (+Spd, -SDef)<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Brick Break<br />
- ExtremeSpeed<br />
- Fire Blast</p>

<p>The star of the show, leadQuaza puts me in a favorable position over the huge majority of Ubers leads. Able to reliably 2HKO even max HP Deoxys-S with Fire Blast + Extremespeed, it doesn't even need to use Draco Meteor to keep Deoxys-S from getting Spikes down, allowing it to keep the pressure up on the opponent. Draco Meteor allows it to OHKO Groudon and Dialga without a massive SpD investment, and 2HKO even the ones that do. As a result, most opponents have to choose between losing their lead and getting Stealth Rock up. Fire Blast also deals nicely with lead Forretress and Scizor. Although I will sacrifice Rayquaza if necessary to take down the other lead without allowing in entry hazards, it usually isn't necessary to do so, and serves as an ordinary MixQuaza for the rest of the game. I use Brick Break over Outrage because of Tyranitar, not wanting to be locked in against Blissey, and because MixQuaza with Brick Break almost single-handedly demolishes Mew Baton Pass teams.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/488.png" alt="Dialga" /><br />
Dialga @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 6 Atk / 252 Spd / 252 SAtk<br />
Hasty nature (+Spd, -Def)<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Dialga gives me a number of useful resistances, notable Water, Rock, Bug and Dark, and is my mid-team Stealth Rock user of choice. It has lots of opportunities to come in and force the opponent out, which is perfect for setting up Stealth Rock. 306 speed is actually not bad at all in Ubers, since most of the other base 90 Pokemon do not use max speed, and even Giratina-o usually has HP Fire. Draco Meteor hits like a ton of bricks, especially boosted by Life Orb. Flamethrower is for Scizor, Forretress and Skarmory. Outrage keeps Dialga from being walled by Blissey, and allows Dialga to 2HKO max HP Kyogre (which it can't with Brick Break). I don't really mind being "walled" by Heatran considered that the rest of my team isn't bothered by Heatran very much (especially slow Heatran) and a full-power Draco Meteor does 48.5% - 57.4% to 4 HP/0 SpD Heatran anyway.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/212.png" alt="Scizor" /><br />
Scizor (F) @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 244 HP / 22 Atk / 76 Def / 168 SDef<br />
Careful nature (+SDef, -SAtk)<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Roost</p>

<p>Scizor plays the critically important role of being my only  Dragon-resist, a very important job in Ubers. I tend to play pretty conservatively with Scizor, knowing that one misprediction could be  trouble against enemy Dragons. U-turn is great for maintaining momentum, one of the keys to this team's success. Superpower is for Dialga and Heatran. I have often considered changing Scizor to SpD Jirachi (which fears mispredicting less), but U-turn and a second priority user are too important to this team to pass up.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/489.png" alt="Palkia" /><br />
Palkia @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 6 Atk / 252 Spd / 252 SAtk<br />
Hasty nature (+Spd, -Def)<br />
- Spacial Rend<br />
- Surf<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Outrage</p>

<p>Every Ubers team needs something to switch into Kyogre's Water Spouts  and something to revenge kill very fast Pokemon like Mewtwo and Darkrai,  and Scarf Palkia happily fills both these roles. Even more fortuitously, it 4x resists Fire, making it excellent for pivots involving Scizor and Groudon. Surf and Fire Blast make Palkia equally comfortable in either Sun or Rain, and discourage Steels from switching in. I absolutely despise Choiced Thunder in Ubers, so Outrage is a rather obvious choice for the fourth move to not be walled by Blissey.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/383.png" alt="Groudon" /><br />
Groudon @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Drought<br />
EVs: 200 HP / 112 Atk / 108 Def / 88 Spd<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SAtk)<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>Groudon is something of a utility Pokemon for this team; it changes the weather against Rain teams, helps a lot against Jolly Lucario, and protects me from Swords Dance Rayquaza. Spreading paralysis is a pretty devious tactic in Ubers, and ParaDancer Groudon is an expert at it. Ironically, Groudon is one of my team's best options against Lugia.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/150.png" alt="Mewtwo" /><br />
Mewtwo @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 26 Atk / 232 Spd / 252 SAtk<br />
Hasty nature (+Spd, -Def)<br />
- Aura Sphere<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Selfdestruct<br />
- Flamethrower</p>

<p>The best late-game sweeper in Pokemon, hands down. Life Orb Mewtwo absolutely tears holes in the other team, either setting up a late sweep for Rayquaza or Palkia or actually sweeping on its own. Selfdestruct is great for taking out anything I recognize could be trouble, such as  Kyogre or Ho-oh. I use Flamethrower over Thunder because the rest of my team will absolutely slaughter any team that loses Scizor, Jirachi or Forretress to Mewtwo.</p>
</div>

<p>There is no doubt that the Uber metagame is filled with very heavy hitters, and reachzero's team takes full advantage of this. This team is unique in that it focuses mostly on its lead, a Mixed Rayquaza. Through Rayquaza's immense power and access to ExtremeSpeed, reachzero seeks to gain momentum from the beginning of the battle by restricting the enemy's ability to set up entry hazards. Powerful and complementary sweepers make up the remainder of the team, to maintain the offensive momentum and to prevent the opponent from gaining the upper hand. Barring Scizor, the remaining Pokemon have at least 150 base points in an offensive stat.</p>

<p>Rayquaza is the star of the show and is the team's lead. By utilizing a combination of Fire Blast and ExtremeSpeed, Deoxys-S can only lay down one entry hazard and before it is forced to switch out. Draco Meteor leaves a gaping dent in Groudon leads, and can even OHKO sometimes. Groudon has to choose between hurting Rayquaza, which denies it a chance to set up Stealth Rock, or set up the entry hazard but leaving Rayquaza unscathed. If Groudon switches out, it has simulatenously failed to both hurt Rayquaza and set up Stealth Rock. Lead Mew and Dialga suffer similarly, although the latter has the option to OHKO Rayquaza with Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse at the cost of laying down Stealth Rock. Rayquaza's Brick Break serves a few purposes &ndash; it tears down the Reflect and Light Screen crucial to a Baton Pass Mew team, as well as ensuring that Heatran and Blissey will not wall the monster.</p>

<p>Dialga is the second in command &ndash; it mimics Rayquaza's ridiculous power and wall breaking ability, while offering vastly different set of resistances and the ability to set up Stealth Rock. With its obscenely powerful Draco Meteor that is exactly as powerful as Rayquaza's, Dialga applies further pressure (no pun intended) to the enemy's insurance against Dragon-type attacks. Flamethrower complements Draco Meteor well, covering Steel types not named Heatran. Dialga's final offensive move, Outrage, allows it to 2HKO Blissey and Ho-Oh, and 3HKO even the bulkiest of Kyogre. Dialga's EV spread appears strange at first, but there is a surprising amount of Pokemon who have lower than 306 Speed, including Naive HP Fire Giratina-O. Despite the Hasty nature and having no investment whatsoever on the defensive side, Dialga's natural bulk and wide array of resistances more than make up for this setback. Together with Rayquaza, these two Pokemon make up reachzero's offensive core.</p>

<p>On the defensive side of things, Scizor provides reachzero with the ever so important Dragon-type resistance, as well as checking the likes of Mewtwo, Latios, and Latias, all of whom can otherwise pose a serious threat to reachzero's team . As it is his sole resistance to Dragon-type moves, reachzero opts for a very defensive spread to ensure that it will not be worn down quickly. With its role in mind, Roost is crucial to its survival. U-turn helps keep the team's offensive momentum and makes up for Scizor's lack of power. Bullet Punch is a must-have move on any Scizor due to its revenging utility &ndash; with this, Rayquaza's ExtremeSpeed, and Mewtwo's and Palkia's massive Speeds, reachzero builds a "wall of Speed" that can easily halt sweepers in their tracks. Finally, Scizor also has Superpower, severely denting Steel-type Pokemon such as Dialga and Heatran.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Palkia is reachzero's check against Choiced Kyogre and Dragon Dance Rayquaza, as well as being an excellent revenger in general. Thunder is absent on this set as being locked into it in Ubers can lead to dire consequences, particularly Groudon and Garchomp coming in for free and setting up. Instead, Outrage is used so that reachzero can hurt Kyogre as well as OHKO Latios and Latias. Fire Blast and Surf allow it to be flexible in the two dominant weathers in the Uber metagame, sun and rain, respectively.</p>

<p>Groudon acts as both as a sweeper and supporter, spreading paralysis around via Thunder Wave and bringing forth the sunlight that powers up the team's many Fire-type attacks as well as overriding the omnipresent Drizzle. Groudon's excellent physical Defense proves useful in stopping Swords Dance Rayquaza and Lucario, as well as being a great safety net against physical attacks in general. Swords Dance allows Groudon to power up its attack and crush its enemies; it works very well with Thunder Wave as it reduces Groudon's general Speed disadvantage against many opponents.</p>

<p>After reachzero has charred, battered, and mostly disintegrated the foe with lethal assaults, Mewtwo utilizes its excellent Speed and coverage to blast apart the remains. Ice Beam and Aura Sphere both complement each other and provides the coverage needed to hit many Pokemon in the Uber metagame super effectively. Flamethrower appears to be an odd choice at first, but since Steel-type Pokemon such as Scizor and Jirachi enjoy switching into Mewtwo, reachzero can roast them by surprise and often remove the enemy's Dragon-type resistance. When things are bleak, Selfdestruct aids reachzero in taking out potential threats.</p>

<p>Despite the incredible power, speed, and defensive versatility that this team depics, there are a few Pokemon who can withstand them and pose a serious threat. A glaring weakness is Mewtwo with the moveset Taunt / Will-O-Wisp / Light Screen / Recover. Light Screen protects Mewtwo from the powerful special assaults reachzero's team can launch - even Dialga's and Rayquaza's Draco Meteors do less than 50%, individually. Furthermore, Pressure quickly drains the PP of many of the special attacks. Will-O-Wisp nullifies Groudon and Scizor as threats and slowly and painfully fries reachzero's team members alive. Ho-Oh's excellent Special Defense and absurdly powerful Sacred Fire can also cause serious issues to the team, and can often leave Mewtwo's Selfdestruct as reachzero's only hope to get rid of it. Finally, the team requires reachzero to be creative when handling Lugia, as it is bulky enough to withstand the most powerful attacks, outstall, and phaze away every one of his team members.</p>
