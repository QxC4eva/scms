<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this item is held, if the holder uses an attack on the opponent that is super effective, its power is increased by 20%.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Expert Belt is the standard no-drawback power item. Most offensive Pokemon will have at least one move in their arsenal capable of hitting the opponent super effectively, and thus more often than not, the attacking move used will be boosted. Thus, Expert Belt is often used in situations where you have a bulky Pokemon which would not appreciate Life Orb recoil, or would not want to be locked into a Choice item, but still wants added power over recovery from Leftovers. While Muscle Band and Wise Glasses may see occasional use on physical and special attackers, respectively, Expert Belt remains the default.</p>

<p>Expert Belt's most common use, however, comes not from exploiting a Pokemon's type coverage, but from exploiting the relative prevalence of Choice items in the metagame. To an opponent who is not paying attention, an Expert Belt Pokemon's damage output is broadly similar to that of a Pokemon with Choice Scarf, and without any other tip-offs like Leftovers recovery, Life Orb recoil, or Balloon warning, the opponent may simply assume that you are Choice-locked and try to set up, while you can quickly switch to a different attack and catch them off-guard. This ruse will only work once, but can be greatly effective if used with a Pokemon that commonly uses a Choice item, such as Hydreigon.</p>
