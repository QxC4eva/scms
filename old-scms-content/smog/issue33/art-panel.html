<h2>Introdution</h2>

<p>Welcome to the 13th iteration of Judge-A-Pok&eacute;mon, where we'll criticize Pok&eacute;mon designs so you don't have to! Since winter still has a hard grip over the northern hemisphere, we'll be covering Ice-types this issue, both new species from Generation VI compared with older creatures from the very first series. Our panel consists of RODAN, Bummer, Treecko and, skylight, represented by Snorlax, Quagsire, Bunnelby, and Emboar respectively. Given the topic, none of these people are as cool as we would like them to be, but they'll nonetheless be able to hail down some cold judgement on our chosen examples this round.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <h2>Avalugg</h2>

   <div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_avalugg.png" alt=""/></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker rodan">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_rodan.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>Avalugg is a cool dude; I mean, he's a walking coffee table. I will never get Game Freak's obsession with defensive Ice-types, considering they have what is arguably the worst defensive typing. Though, I have to say, between him and Cryogonal, their designs have been spot-on. Avalugg legitimately is an immovable object; he just has an overall really wicked design. The coolest part is his huge flat back, which, if you are small enough, could probably be skated on. Or, if you need a flat surface to sleep on, he's your best bet Pok&eacute;mon-wise.</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker skylight">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_skylight.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>Out of all of the XY Pok&eacute;mon, Avalugg has one of the most interesting designs. However, interesting isn't necessarily good in Avalugg's case. I feel like Game Freak just did one draft of Avalugg and was like "Yeah, this seems good enough; now let's give it huge Defense and Rapid Spin so nobody will complain about how bad its design is." Avalugg would have been probably better if it was upside down, because the whole flat top thing doesn't really work in Pok&eacute;mon designs. I kind of wonder how Avalugg as a whole was put together because there is no way the iceberg could've just fallen out of the sky to magically attach to legs. If it was upside down, maybe legs could've grown out of it, but as it is, I just... don't get it. Props to Avalugg for trying to be stylish by having earrings, but they're kind of too big for it SO the purpose of having earrings is pretty much defeated; not that there is much purpose in the first place!</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker treecko">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_treecko.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>I'd like to think that I'm a very efficient person; I reuse old water bottles rather than buying more, support local agriculture by buying my produce at farmers' markets, and always recycle paper and plastic. When I saw Avalugg, I thought of it as the perfect opportunity to replace my old bed. And my old table. And my old kitchen counters. Basically, Avalugg appears to be the perfect flat surface. However, standing slightly taller than I do and weighing in at over 1000 lbs/500 kg doesn't exactly make for the ideal bed or table or counter, but whatever you've gotta do for efficiency, right? Basically what I'm getting at is that tables aren't cool, and despite its frosty design, neither is Avalugg. I hate to be one to cry about unoriginal designs, but I mean, what else am I supposed to do with this one? Poor guy is all cracked up too. :( I'm pretty sure Avalugg was Game Freak's red-headed stepchild of XY.</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker bummer">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_bummer.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>In many ways, I find Avalugg to be a warped mirror image of last gen's Cryogonal. A pure-bred Ice-type, exceeding in one defensive stat, knowing both Recover and Rapid Spin, and a design which basically aims to give life-like attributes to ordinary ice structures. While playing Pok&eacute;mon Y, I anticipated great things from Bergmite's final form, but as I later got to see it, my expectations was left unrewarded. I've seen plenty of homegrown Pok&eacute;mon designs from various fans, and one textbook mistake is to simply take an object and then add limbs and head to it. This is why it pains me to see Game Freak in the same trap. That is not to say that I would have loved to see an iceberg design&mdash;it was in fact what I was hoping to see judging from Bergmite's appearance&mdash;but the way they handled this design makes me wonder if they had simply forgotten about Avalugg one day before deadline and quickly left their new intern to fill in the blanks. Contrary to what the design may tell you, its cracked body and gnarly head didn't fall as flat as its legs, as they don't share much similarities to the rest of its physique and instead appear to have been glued on for support. It's almost like I wish they could have pulled a Geodude and left its body floating free in air, but when you're a 1000-pound-iceberg gone rogue, I guess the same rules don't apply.</p></div>

  <h2>Aurorus</h2>

   <div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_aurorus.png" alt=""/></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker treecko">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_treecko.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>A couple of days before Aurorus and Tyrantrum were announced, I'd been on another rant in #pokemon about how the perfect new type would have been dinosaur. Then, as though they were mocking me, Game Freak revealed these two literal dinosaurs and revealed that they were Ice- and Dragon-type, respectively, as though Yilx was a covert operative whose job was to make me sad. Still, even though Aurorus's typing didn't live up to what I'd hoped for, it's a pretty awesome looking Pok&eacute;mon. Its enormous head fins make it look elegant, and its bejewelled body, while the slightest bit gaudy, is everything I could have hoped for as a Pok&eacute;mon fan. They probably should have let you ride Aurorus in the games like you could Gogoat, Mamoswine, and Rhyhorn (I mean, seriously, how cool would it be to ride a dinosaur?), but even without that cool feature, I liked to imagine that I could anyway. It's a shame that Aurorus has probably the worst typing known to man without any noteworthy base stats.</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker rodan">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_rodan.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>I really like Aurorus. As a kid, I was never really into badass T-Rexes and such; I always liked the gentle giants of the Brontosaurus (plus, its name means thunder lizard; how cool is that?). So when Amaura was revealed, I was like, "Really? This thing looks like something from a Kimberly-Clark binder for eight-year-old girls." I was crushed by this realization, but then the months passed and Aurorus was revealed, and I was relieved immensely. This is what I was expecting: a big bulky bronto. The fins on its neck are dumb, but it serves the aurora purpose, which is fine. Kudos to them for sticking to the theme. The one thing that sucks about Aurorus is not at all design-wise, but in fact kit-wise. Ice / Rock is terrible typing, first of all, coupled by the fact that it's really frail and has a pretty useless ability. God bless Aurorus; maybe one day, you will be good!</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker bummer">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_bummer.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>It is theorized by many that Aurorus carries the burden of wiping out the rest of its fellow kin, but whether it did so by bringing forth the Ice Age or by the virtue of its appearance has yet to be established. I, for one, welcome the addition of a Rock / Ice Pok&eacute;mon, and was glad to see the concept among this new gen's fossil records. But judging by its flamboyant looks, I may be on the fence about it. One side of me argues that incorporating auroras into a clunky dinosaur wasn't the wisest of decisions, and that the small gems placed along its body feel forced as they only serve to emphasize the Ice typing further. My other side, however, advocates that it's a simple yet elegant design that also did a decent job combining sail dinosaurs with northern lights, and the light blue body pattern resembling snow crystals suits it well. With these two sides clashing against each other like two neighbors arguing about appropriate hedge measurements, I feel the need to compromise. As much as I love puns in Pok&eacute;mon names, I'd rather have seen auroras in a different concept, but given the end product, they did a solid job. I look forward using it.</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker skylight">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_skylight.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>Aurorus has an amazing design, so amazing that it actually looks like ice royalty; all it needs is its crown. But really, it has ice diamonds attached to its body, jewels on its face, and something hanging off its neck that makes it look like it's running from a wedding. It also has a cute anime-style face, which is much nicer than Avalugg! On the downside, the tail just seems to just chucked on at the end, while a shorter tail in its place would have probably fit better. Perhaps if it had Lapras's pose, it would look more majestic, but for ice royalty, it looks good enough.</p></div>

  <h2>Jynx</h2>

   <div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_jynx.png" alt=""/></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker skylight">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_skylight.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>Nicki Minaj, aka Jynx, doesn't really look like an Ice-type Pok&eacute;mon. It could've easily passed for a Normal-type, given that Jynx looks as as, uh, let's just say, as "creative" as Mr. Mime (note: not actually necessarily a good thing!). She's also a fucking badass chick (even more so than the actual Nicki Minaj). It has muscles on its arms, which totally goes against what an ice queen should have... or maybe not, given that ice queens are meant to be live life alone and be ~strong~; that's what Frozen taught me, at least. Despite having quite visible muscles, Jynx of course had to have the blonde hair (Why, because all girls have to be blonde to be strong?? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, GAME FREAK?). On the bright side, at least she has cute lips!</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker bummer">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_bummer.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>With several generations of Pok&eacute;mon games having passed us by, it's inevitable that a large number of people choose to prefer the original 151 designs, as they are closest to the idea that spawned it all and thus considered most true to the ideal. Which is why I appreciate the existence of Jynx for the sole purpose of proving them all wrong. Granted, it's difficult to outline what can be a Pok&eacute;mon and what cannot, as one cannot assume that everything needs to be either beasts and ghouls found in a typical fantasy game, but at least it should be safe to assume that your wild encounters shouldn't resemble humans to the point of mistaking them for one. Which brings us to Jynx. Grab a valkyrie from your local Opera house, draw her in a Pok&eacute;mon-esque fashion, and the results would not be too far from what Jynx brings to the table. While the style itself may be sound, the concept itself has stumbled all the way down into the uncanny valley, which makes every trainer ask themselves whether they're raising a battle creature or becoming guilty of human slave labor. This is an idea that you'd expect to surface once all other areas has been mined for interesting Pok&eacute;mon designs, and not something to appear within the first batch. As if Mr. Mime wasn't bad enough already.</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker treecko">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_treecko.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>I used to think Jynx was a really cool Pok&eacute;mon before it dropped to my favorite tier, NU, and decided to wreak absolute chaos upon the tier. It might not be a fan-favorite, but I think that kind of adds to its charm. I mean, who can honestly say, in a world filled with sleek foxes, adorable bunnies, and vicious Dragons, that their favorite Pok&eacute;mon is a short human-looking thing with Psychic powers and the ability to shoot beams of ice from its mouth? But it's that same oddness that makes Jynx's design so endearing. Plus, she's got a figure, and she's not afraid to show it off. To be honest, I think what actually makes me like Jynx so much is that if she could be a boy, she would be a perfect drag queen—a cold bitch with big hair, a fabulous red gown, and lips perfect for, uh, lip-syncing. This is the kind of girl I'd go out to the clubs with for sure.</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker rodan">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_rodan.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>Jynx is hilarious; it may be the biggest "what were they thinking" moment in Pok&eacute;mon history. Picture this: Ken Sugimori is just sitting there and was like, "What if we made a Pok&eacute;mon that is a racially insensitive black woman?" All she needed was a front porch and she may have gone down in history as the most ridiculous Pok&eacute;mon ever designed. Not only that, but Jynx is also the first Pok&eacute;mon to look like a strange human-like female thing, leading the way to Poke-waifus such as Gardevoir or a Lucario with breasts. The saddest part of this story is alas the end of it, Game Freak came to their senses and was like, "Well, fuck, we cant have Aunt Jemima as a Pok&eacute;mon," so they just recolored the skin. RIP in peace, you beautiful black soul.</p></div>

  <h2>Lapras</h2>

   <div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_lapras.png" alt=""/></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker treecko">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_treecko.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>I remember when I was a kid and played Pok&eacute;mon Blue, and I always got so excited when the guy in Silph Co. gave me my Lapras, even though I never used it. Back then, it looked really cool to me! It had that huge shell and a little horn on its forehead, and whenever I used Surf, it was there to tote me around, even when it wasn't in my party. But as I grew older, my child-like wonder left with every passing generation, and Lapras began to seem more and more lame. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that Lapras is basically a blue version of Spongebob's pet snail, Gary, and it's just about as useful. The reason why I never used Lapras in Blue version is because by the time I got it, the rest of my party would be in levels around 30, and Lapras was sitting pretty at level 15, expecting me to do all the hard work of training it up or something. Even worse, it kind of reminds me of Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars&mdash;it's pretty fat and has tiny appendages sticking out from its sides. Sorry, Lapras fans, but I really can't get behind this one.</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker rodan">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_rodan.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>Lapras is a hallmark design in Pok&eacute;mon history; it's so sleek and simplistic in design. There is nothing harder than keeping it simple, as later gens of Pok&eacute;mon have proved (I'm looking at you, Kyurem formes). Lapras is also just elegant; this is the Pok&eacute;mon you would take with you to a fancy gala whereas Jynx is the Pok&eacute;mon you would take to some dirty nightclub. The best thing about Lapras bar none, though, is he is the original surfer; be honest with me, you have fascinated about riding a Lapras over the seas. In the anime, they literally slept on her and she had telekinesis and shit. The fact that you could never catch one in the wild just added to the mystique. Tenouttaten.</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker skylight">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_skylight.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>If Jynx is the queen of ice, Lapras is the queen of the sea (or king, I guess). Lapras has such a peaceful design despite it basically reflecting the Loch Ness monster. The shell really adds a lot to its design, because to me it reflects that it's part of the land (as in the shell being the earth, and it being the sea) and sea at once, despite the fact that a Lapras on land is a kind of awkward thought. The only complaint about Lapras is its ears; did Game Freak really think they were in style? I will commend it on how perfect its legs look, because I'm pretty sure I could turn... whatever I'd need to turn if Lapras would give me one hug with those legs. Let's not think about how extremely awkward that would be, though...</p></div>

  <div class="panel-speaker bummer">
  <div class="float-left"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/jap_bummer.png" alt="" /></div>
  <p>Lapras is yet another dragon-like species that the first gen let loose in the Kanto region, but it's one that's easier to support. Much like Loch Ness, no player at that point had actually met a Lapras in the wild, as its existence was exclusively upheld by a Silph employee handing out free samples. And it wasn't particularly difficult to be intrigued by it. It was large, it had a cool shell, and the horn on its head almost made you feel like you'd been gifted by what mermaids would consider to be a sea unicorn. Given all of the various Pok&eacute;mon designs up to this point, Lapras appears to be too simple, but at the same time, there's nothing I'd do to change it. This elusive ocean dweller is a perfect example of how to include enough details to make it interesting without overdoing it, which many have considered to be a key element to RBY's designs. Either that or nostalgia has made me unaware of the rose-colored glasses I'm wearing. I'm fine either way.</p></div>
