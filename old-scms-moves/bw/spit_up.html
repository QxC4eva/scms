[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Fails if the user has not used the move Stockpile before this move. After Spit Up is used, the Stockpile counter is reset, and the user loses all Defense and Special Defense boosts gained through using Stockpile. Base Power depends on the number of Stockpiles used before this move, as follows:</p>

<table class="sortable">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Number of Stockpiles</th>
<th>Base Power</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr><td>1</td> <td>100</td></tr>
<tr class="a"><td>2</td> <td>200</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td ><td>300</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>If you're using Stockpile, you're likely using it to boost your Pokemon's defenses in the same vein as Cosmic Power, and not for Spit Up or its equally terrible brother Swallow. The huge Base Power of Spit Up after three Stockpile boosts might sound alluring, but keep in mind that you spend three turns gaining the boosts, and could have dealt more damage by just using any STAB attack.</p>
