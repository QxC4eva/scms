<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The best possible Pokemon for an in-game team are the ones that are obtainable at the start of the game, can OHKO enemies easily, take little damage from nearly any attack, can learn many HMs, can heal itself, can learn useful moves upon level-up, doesn't need excessive TMs, and has a useful ability. Such a Pokemon doesn't exist of course, but this means that Pokemon closer to this ideal are obviously the best ones possible.</p>

<p>The goal of this in-game tier list is to recommend a select group of Pokemon for an efficient run through the game. The ones that fit most of the above requirements are placed in the high tier. Very inefficient Pokemon will be put in the low tier. Ones that are neither efficient nor inefficient, for example Pokemon that have some opportunity costs but don't end up as good as high tiered ones, will be put in the middle tier.</p>

<p>Don't confuse an efficient run with a speed run. Speed runs are often ones that are segmented and recorded with luck manipulation through resets, and aim for the absolute fastest time recorded, but the real time spent on them is usually much more. Just assume you want to play through in a relatively fast timeframe.</p>

<p>Team size is actually most efficient if you use only one member, but I'm assuming something more like 3 members, as otherwise you get extremely centralized lists with starters and early game Pokemon at the far top and everything else pretty much too inefficient to bother with.</p>

<p>Also note when reading through this guide that some of the moves and abilities listed for a Pokemon may only be obtained by their evolutions. Some Pokemon may be placed in higher tiers due to their evolution's capabilities as well. Some Pokemon may be placed high on the tier, though they may only be obtainable via the Pokewalker. This tier list assumes that the Pokemon are obtained in-game, unless specified otherwise.</p>

<p>Note about the Pokéwalker: some of the Pokemon listed below require 10,000+ Watts to unlock with the Pokéwalker. As the Pokéwalker is a pedometer (which counts your real-life steps), for your health, please do not overexert yourself to obtain every single Pokemon in one go. Obtaining all of the Pokemon takes real time, and obtaining Pokemon is not worth enough to risk your own health. For more information on how to use the Pokéwalker and its intricacies, follow the link to the Bulbapedia article <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokewalker">here</a>.

<dd>Movepool: Decent</dd>
<dd>Additional Comments: While it is rare and only available during the Bug Catching Contest, its Technician-boosted moves, such as Aerial Ace and Quick Attack, are incredibly powerful, especially when compared to the rest of your team at the time. It keeps its usefulness throughout the game thanks to its generally high Speed and Attack stats and good movepool.</dd>

<dt>Geodude</dt>
<dd>Availability: Very Early</dd>
<dd>Stats: Average</dd>
<dd>Movepool: Decent</dd>
<dd>Additional Comments: While it requires a Trade to become fully-evolved, its Rock/Ground typing, high Defense and Attack, and good movepool is amazing in-game and usually won't require full evolution. Unfortunately, it's almost useless against the eighth Gym and the Elite Four.</dd>

<dd>Availability: Late</dd>
<dd>Stats: Very High</dd>
<dd>Movepool: Wide</dd>
<dd>Additional Comments: While caught late in the game, its high level, incredible stats, and movepool more than make up for it. It also has amazing match-ups against the Elite Four and can almost single-handedly carry the team through the bulk of it.</dd>

<dt>Magikarp (Gyarados)</dt>
<dd>Availability: Early</dd>
<dd>Stats: High</dd>
<dd>Movepool: Shallow</dd>
<dd>Additional Comments: Magikarp is incredibly useless when caught and requires a lot of training; however, once evolved into Gyarados, its stats skyrocket, and while its movepool is shallow, it learns decent moves through level-up, TMs, and HMs.</dd>

<dt>Mareep</dt>
<dd>Availability: Very Early</dd>
<dd>Stats: Above Average</dd>

<dd>Stats: Above Average</dd>
<dd>Movepool: Very Wide</dd>
<dd>Additional Comments: While its level-up movepool is poor, it's just good enough to stay useful until you acquire a Moon Stone to fully evolve it. Once fully evolved, its stats are very high compared to the rest of your team, its TM movepool is gigantic, and its typing is amazing against Team Rocket.</dd>

<dd>Stats: High</dd>
<dd>Movepool: Wide</dd>
<dd>Additional Comments: It is incredibly hard to train until evolution, but is very powerful and fast once it does evolve. It does require a Trade to become fully evolved, though Kadabra is plenty strong and is great for defeating the fifth Gym and Team Rocket.</dd>

<dd>Availability: Early</dd>
<dd>Stats: Above Average</dd>
<dd>Movepool: Decent</dd>
<dd>Additional Comments: While it requires a Trade to become fully evolved, its Attack is very high and is very useful at the time it's acquired in Goldenrod. It does lose usefulness later in the game if you don't fully evolve it.</dd>

<dd>Movepool: Wide</dd>

<dd>Movepool: Wide</dd>
<dd>Additional Comments: While its stats are kind of poor, its movepool and ability Tinted Lens allow it to veritably blow through many of the in-game teams. It's also very helpful against the fourth and fifth Gyms, as well as Team Rocket.</dd>

<dd>Availability: Very Early</dd>
<dd>Stats: Average</dd>
<dd>Movepool: Decent</dd>
<dd>Additional Comments: While normally not obtainable until late in the game, it can be acquired very, very early in the game through the Pokéwalker. It only takes 2,000 Watts in the first area to unlock. It is fast and powerful and a very good substitute for Spearow.</dd>

It only takes 500 Watts (and then a further 1,000 Watts in the Suburban Area) in the Pokéwalker to be acquired, and its typing and high Special Attack can prove invaluable in-game. If not obtained through the Pokéwalker, it will always prove to be inferior to Mareep by the time you can catch one.</dd>

Fortunately, it can be acquired very early in the game via the Pokéwalker. It only requires 2,000 Watts in the Pokéwalker. Its movepool is pretty bad until it learns BubbleBeam at level 19, but its typing is phenomonal in-game.</dd>

<dd>Additional Comments: It can only be obtained by hatching the Egg that you receive from the Professor's aide, and will be at level 1 when you do hatch it. However, it's decently bulky, and it comes with Extrasensory, which is great for Team Rocket and the fourth Gym. It can also be evolved rather quickly through max Happiness.</dd>

However, it is obtained as a level 5 Eevee from Bill with very bad attacks. Fortunately, it can be evolved very early with a Water Stone, and it's received at a time when HM Surf and TM Shadow Ball should be available to you.</dd>

Once you unlock the GTS Trade system and do an International Trade, the Beyond the Sea area will be unlocked in the Pokéwalker. Regardless of when you obtain Chinchou, its stats are very balanced, its typing is great in-game, and it learns useful moves through level-up and TM.</dd>

It requires 2,000 Watts (and then 5,000 Watts in the Blue Lake area) to unlock. It evolves very late, and it's hard to train, but it learns Dragon Rage at level 15 which is very useful in-game. It remains useful up until the eighth Gym, by which time it can only rely on the unreliable Dragon Rush for STAB. It does learn Surf and Waterfall, however.</dd>
