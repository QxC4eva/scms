Monthly Art Contest #5: Fossil Fantasy
[head]

[page]

<p>Fossil Pokemon: relics of the past that even surpass OU Exeggutor and 90%-accurate Blizzard. Since the first time you find a fossil, Helix or Claw, in Mt. Moon, your interest is piqued as to what it could be. Where did this strange rock come from? What Pokemon could it be? How many Hyper Potions could you get for it? The Fossils have been subject to much mystery throughout the generations: a perfect subject for an MAC theme.</p>
