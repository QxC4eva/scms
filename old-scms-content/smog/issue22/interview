    <div class="aside">
        <p>I'm sitting in my cozy little apartment in central nowhere Wisconsin, huddled under a blanket near the fire on my TV trying to keep warm from the freakish coldspell slowly trying to freeze me to death. As my fingers numbingly check my inbox on Smogon I get a mysterious video call on my Skype. I answer it, but at first there is no one there, and then all of the sudden a deep menacing voice informs me that I have been summoned to conduct the next interview for The Smog and I am to be on the East Coast by tomorrow morning.</p>
        <p>"But they just had a massive storm there like, literally a week ago!" I reply.</p>
        <p>All I get from the other end is a soft chuckle and then the voice says "Good luck."</p>
        <p>Well that's reassuring.</p>
        <p>My plane touches down in what can be best described as a disaster area, and as I hobble over mounds of wreckage to the address given to me by the mysterious voice, I arrive at the humble abode of our next interviewee. Thankfully, he's seated outside in plain sight underneath the street light, which appears to be the only power source in the area judging by the amount of cellphones hooked up to it in some fashion. My interviewee offers me a folding camping chair and I being the interview.</p>

        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>Let's start with the essentials of a good interview: who are you, what do you do, what do you want to become in life?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>I'm a part time college student. I have done work as a biofeedback technician with some neat equipment that uses electromagnetic frequencies. That's the direction I see myself going in right now, looking to get into the medical field.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>Biofeedback? That sounds kinda intense!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>It is actually low-key. But the results are resounding.</p>
    </div>
     
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>Oh? As in how?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>I see a big success rate in the clients I have treated.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>Interesting, so do you really enjoy the personal interaction with your clients? I know some people that simply go into the medical field for the money.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="aside">
        <p>I die a little inside saying this knowing I will be forever destitute being a teacher.</p>
    </div>
     
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>I do too unfortunately, but that isn't my motivation. Knowing that you are capable of having a positive impact in someone's wellbeing is indescribable. It is something I discovered as soon as I started practicing and it never really dissipates over time.</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>Very cool. OK, moving onto Smogon and Pokemon. So you're the head of Tournaments on Smogon; what got you started there and why have you been a part of that section of the site for so long?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>My roots on Smogon are unrelated to where I began. The thing that initially drew me to Smogon was the competitiveness of the Wi-Fi section, breeding for top level Pokemon. I transitioned to Shoddy Battle and never looked back. Tournaments appealed to me because that is where all of the revered players participated.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="aside">
        <p>My brain does a mini-explosion hearing that the current head of Tournaments was once a Wi-Fier. Though somehow it all makes sense....</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>What got you started in actually participating in the staff portion of tournaments?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>Hosting tournaments was a major interest of mine. After getting heavily involved in the Smogon Tour, Aeolus gave me a position on the team.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>What is it about the Smogon Tour that you like so much? You've been hosting and running it for quite a while now.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>It is easily accessible for new players and the format offers a dynamic challenge to all of the veterans. There is something for everyone since each individual tour is its own tournament.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="aside">
        <p>As he says this, a family member of his suddenly bursts out of a pile of rubble about 15 feet away and brushes off the dirt.</p>
        <p>"Hey cousin Ralph, good to see you made it through the storm!" KG yells and waves to this apparently part-mole relative of his.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>Tell me about the Smogon Frontier too. Who's idea was it originally and why did you pick it up to host it (though user Eo Ut Mortus took up the mantle this latest rendition of it)?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>The original Frontier was hosted in 2006. I believe it was EeveeTrainer's idea, but Aeolus is the one who decided to bring it back in 2008. I picked it up after the tournament changed hands several times in a short period in 2009. I knew I could get it running to a certain quality.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>A quality that demands a crapload of work. What was the thought process behind having the Frontier portion of the site look as it does now?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>The layout of the site predates my hosting it, though I did make subtle changes to stay current with the format.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>Care to share any opinions as to why the so-called "unbeatable tournament" has been defeated 4 times in a row thus far?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>It's not something I can really explain. On paper it is the most challenging tournament we have to offer.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="aside">
        <p>After giving this bit of a nebulous answer, my attention is drawn to the horde of people suddenly running towards us from the direction of the ocean. KG seems to pay no mind to them though.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>Alright, shifting the subject a little bit again, your battling seems to have drifted off since winning the Smogon Tour versus Bluewind. Are there any tournaments yet that still excite you and that you want to be a part of?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>Asking the tough questions, haha. It's not that I am no longer motivated to play because there are plenty of exciting tournaments. Tournaments require dedication to make a deep run in and that's just something I haven't been available or willing to do recently. I have participated in tournaments, but more casually. Sometimes the competitive aspect of this game becomes too serious and it's a nice change of pace to lighten up on that.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>I can relate lol. If you had to forcibly participate in one tournament this next year which would you do?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>ST9. If there is a tournament I need to play in, that would be the one. Getting knocked out of the last one is the last point I remember putting a substantial amount of effort into a tournament. I haven't forgotten about that, haha.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="aside">
        <p>Now a flock of seagulls flies overhead in the same direction the people ran in earlier. I must begin to show a bit of nervousness since KG offers me a can of lemonade curiously entitled "Summer of Kevin". It was actually quite delicious.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>Hopefully you will be able to participate in the upcoming tourney and win another trophy to put next to your impressive badgeset. Speaking of the badgeset, you're also involved in a lot of other aspects of the forums as well, including Tutoring and formerly The Smog and Smeargle's Studio. What has driven you to become so deeply committed to the forums?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>Tutoring is where I began my contributions. I was still relatively unknown when I was accepted thanks to some very helpful references. That part of the site has always appealed to me because it is an outlet to help other members get involved, whether that be competitively or through their contributions.</p>
        <p>You get to know the people you tutor, too. For instance, I tutored Jimbo who went on to run Battling 101 and The Smog, which is how I got involved here, haha.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="aside">
        <p>Ah, that's how the Wi-Fi connection makes sense... As I think this to myself I look down to see that we are now actually floating on our camping chairs in about a foot of water. KG again seems to pay no mind and looks to me to continue the interview.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>OK, last two questions I think. What is your favorite Pokemon, and what is your opinion of user Earthworm?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker kevin">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_kevin.png" alt="Kevin Garret" />
        <p>My favorite Pokemon is the spirited Chimchar.</p>
        <p>As for Earthworm, he is quite a character. He is meticulous almost to a fault and extremely dedicated to fairness and making the right decision. That being said, he was a great leader in Tournaments and there are practices he lived by that I will look to use when it is called for. That dedication is evident in his play, being one of the most decorated players ever.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="aside">
        <p>As KG finishes I realize that we are now quite literally floating down the street on a veritable river stemming from the ocean.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
        <img src="/media/upload/smog/issue22/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
        <p>Awesome, well thank you for taking part in the interview; it was a pleasure talking with you!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="aside">
        <p>I quickly leap from my camping chair and latch onto the wing of a plane escaping the wall of water, and like the gremlin decide to shimmy up to the window and scare the beejuzus out of William Shatner as I make my way back home.</p>
