<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder scores a critical hit, the critical hit deals 3x damage rather than 2x damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sniper really isn't that good of an ability if you consider that critical hits only have a 6.25% chance of happening. The best Pokemon to use it with might be <a href="/bw/pokemon/drapion">Drapion</a> since it can use <a href="/bw/moves/night_slash">Night Slash</a>, but really Drapion has no place in OU currently. <a href="/bw/pokemon/kingdra">Kingdra</a> gets it also, but it also gets <a href="/bw/abilities/swift_swim">Swift Swim</a>, a much better ability, so it is very rare you will see Sniper come into effect.</p>
