<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is my team, which I've had for a while now. I think I started using the earliest version of what I consider to be it since last suspect test (I had Lickitung over Stunky at that time, but as soon as Vulpix was banned I replaced Lickitung). I plan on using versions of this team for a good while longer, however it will probably be changing quite a lot as it is structured quite fluidly.</p>

<p>That being said, the way I structured this team is as follows: Dwebble, 4 Pokemon core to check the big threats, 1 filler Pokemon to take on whatever is left or provide offensive presence. I suppose Dwebble will never be replaceable, simply because it is the best at what it does and until entry hazards become ineffective (or somehow just Dwebble becomes ineffective), I will continue to use it. The big threats in this metagame are obviously the suspects... after this round we'll see what the 'new' big threats are.</p>

<p>Thanks a ton to Fate for the pictures, you guys should all go Luvdisc this <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=75642">art thread</a> as it is very close to holding the record of most Luv'd. Also there are some pretty pictures there.</p>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p><img src="/media/smog/16/featuredlcrmt_dwebble.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dwebble @ Oran Berry<br />
Trait: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 236 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Rock Blast<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Spikes</p>

<p>Dwebble is on my team to do what it does best--lay down entry hazards as fast as possible. This team is fairly defensive in nature and I switch quite frequently to force the opponent's threats out, so entry hazards are very important in most matches. In some matches, they aren't as important though, and Dwebble is just death fodder, or is used to help check Carvanha or something similar.</p>

<p>The set is standard and for the most part self-explanatory. Toxic, the only move that actually requires explanation, is used in situations where I feel that badly poisoning a threat is a better option than getting up another layer of hazards. I often use it on Misdreavus to help make Stunky's job easier, and occasionally on Gligar.</p>


<p><img src="/media/smog/16/featuredlcrmt_slowpoke.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Slowpoke @ Eviolite<br />
Trait: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 196 HP / 236 Def / 36 SpA / 36 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Scald<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Slack Off<br />
- Toxic</p>

<p>Slowpoke is the first part of my "core", and helps to combat Timburr, Meditite, Gligar, and a variety of other physical attackers. Slowpoke is generally a catch-all for when nothing else can handle a threat, and is usually my first switch into most physical Pokemon, because it can afford to take a hit due to Regeneration.</p>

<p>The 'standard' Slowpoke has a ton of options, so I may as well explain why I chose these moves. Toxic is staple for me--I constantly find myself building bulky/balanced teams in Little Cup, and I constantly find myself playing teams like that, and Toxic works to give me an edge against them. Scald may seem slightly weird in conjunction with Toxic, but they are used against mostly different opponents, so I rarely worry about accidentally burning something that I meant to Toxic (maybe opposing Slowpoke that come in to tank a hit?). It is a better move against Gligar than Surf, as it still 2HKOes the standard Eviolite Gligar, but a chance to burn is much better than the slight increase in power if Gligar attempts to stall out PP or go for Sand Veil hax or something. Scald also helps me to threaten Pokemon like Carvanha and Scraggy in a pinch, as opposed to not being able to do anything. Psychic helps to put a chokehold on Timburr, who I don't have a solid answer to otherwise, and helps with opposing Mienfoo lategame, as well as various other Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="/media/smog/16/featuredlcrmt_mienfoo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Mienfoo @ Eviolite<br />
Trait: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 156 Spe
Jolly Nature<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Taunt<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Toxic</p>

<p>The second part of my core. Mienfoo basically ensures that I don't have issues with Scraggy, and it helps to reduce what would otherwise be a pretty big Carvanha weakness. Many people say that Mienfoo doesn't really beat Scraggy if it uses Dragon Dance twice, and they are right.... if Mienfoo doesn't run 18 Attack (or lacks Fake Out). I was actually aware of that ever since I started using the set and for a while I ran 17 Attack anyways, but eventually people caught on and wizened up I was forced to switch back to 18 Attack or continually lose to good Scraggy players. I miss having the extra Speed point, as it is very helpful to have a guaranteed Taunt against Dwebble leads, but 'oh well'.</p>

<p>As I just alluded to, the main reason I have Taunt over Payback or Fake Out is to stop opposing Dwebble and Ferroseed from getting lots of hazards up. Mienfoo can only check Carvanha solidly if it is above 18 HP (max 21), so if the opponent gets more than a layer or two of hazards up, I am really in a bind, and will be forced to wear Carvanha down with other means. The other moves are entirely standard on Mienfoo. I suppose I could drop Toxic for Fake Out and then switch back to 17 Speed.... but I don't particularly want to?</p>

<p><img src="/media/smog/16/featuredlcrmt_stunky.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Stunky @ Eviolite<br />
Trait: Aftermath<br />
EVs: 12 HP / 252 Atk / 188 SpD / 4 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Explosion</p>

<p>Stunky is the third part of the core, 'and is only on the team to help deal with Misdreavus'. That, however, doesn't stop it from doing much more for my team, such as providing strong priority, being a secondary Carvanha check, having Explosion to remove random Pokemon, etc. Basically, while taking out Misdreavus is of first-and-foremost importance, Stunky can do other things in a pinch, even if it doesn't get to every match.</p>

<p>I'm running all three Dark moves because it is needed to properly slam Misdreavus. Most Misdreavus have Will-O-Wisp, and Stunky cannot reliably take those versions out without Crunch. Explosion was chosen as the last slot because I didn't want to give Pokemon like Scraggy. It also allows me to take out an opposing Pokemon when I feel that Stunky has nothing else to offer against the opposing team. I am running a slow, bulky Stunky to help against Misdreavus. I've found Speed to be generally useless for Stunky anyways, all it would really help for would be ensuring a faster Explosion against Meditite or other similar Pokemon. Attack is maximized because I wanted to hit as hard as possible, and then I just made Stunky as bulky as I could.</p>

<p><img src="/media/smog/16/featuredlcrmt_misdreavus.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Misdreavus @ Eviolite<br />
Trait: Levitate<br />
EVs: 240 SpA / 240 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting<br />
- Will-O-Wisp</p>

<p>As the final part of my core, Misdreavus helps to take on Fighting-types in case Slowpoke fails, and provides an offensive presence for my team. Nasty Plot/Will-O-Wisp Misdreavus may seem strange, but it is effective in this metagame. Against teams without Stunky, I have a powerful sweeper that can clean up when I need it to, and against teams with Stunky, it is not complete deadweight. I have considered removing Nasty Plot for something like Taunt or Icy Wind, but I like having an actual sweeper on this team and Nasty Plot allows Misdreavus to be that.</p>

<p>Max Speed and Special Attack may not be the best, but I appreciate having a 19-speeder when things go wrong against Gligar, as it turns an 100% loss into a 50% one. If I end up removing Nasty Plot, I may be more inclined to running a less offensive EV spread.</p>

<p><img src="/media/smog/16/featuredlcrmt_snover.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Snover @ Eviolite<br />
Trait: Snow Warning<br />
EVs: 36 HP / 184 Atk / 36 Def / 184 SpA / 40 Spe<br />
Lonely Nature<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Ice Shard<br />
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>This is..... not so standard. I honestly whipped it up randomly after Acrobatics Gligar started becoming more popular, because I needed a Pokemon that could help to check Gligar while also being a good switch in to Staryu and other Water-types. I was hesitant to use Snover initially, but it is a fantastic fit for the team. It really eats up 'Sandstorm' teams, being able to easily destroy Hippopotas, Drilbur, Gligar, Ferroseed, and Lileep. Most battles against teams like that just involve taking out the one or two Pokemon that can beat Snover and then just spamming Blizzard and Giga Drain. Its ability to bluff a Choice Scarf allows it to occasionally get nice surprise kills against random Pokemon as well, which is another nice plus (although now that I've battled everyone in the tier a few times and am posting this team I guess that is slightly irrelevant!).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
 
<p>Elevator Music's team held onto the #1 spot on the leaderboard throughout the entire round of Little Cup Suspect Testing. To accomplish this feat, Elevator Music had to not only deal with all the top threats in the metagame, but also counter every single playstyle. During this round of testing, threatening Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Meditite, and Acrobatics Gligar were frequently used, and Elevator Music's team uses a four Pokemon core that allows him to deal with these top threats. Elevator Music's goal is not to leave huge dents in the opponent's team for a final Pokemon to sweep, but to rack up entry hazard damage on the opponent by switching in counters to his opponent's Pokemon, thereby forcing switches.</p>
 
<h2>Lead</h2>
 
<p>Elevator Music leads with Dwebble, a great lead during the round. Dwebble can set up entry hazards on the majority of leads, thanks to a combination of relatively high bulk, Sturdy, and Oran Berry. Elevator Music often plays Dwebble as a suicide lead. As long as Dwebble can set up both Stealth Rock and at least a layer of Spikes, Elevator Music will opt for that, as racking up entry hazard damage on the opposing team can exert pressure on the opponent.</p>
 
<h2>Core</h2>
 
<p>The core of Elevator Music's team includes four Pokemon, each with a task that allows the team to be successful. It consists of Slowpoke, Mienfoo, Stunky, and Misdreavus. These four Pokemon can stop almost every single threat in the tier. Slowpoke serves as the physical wall and deals with Gligar&mdash;the most used Pokemon&mdash;very well. Mienfoo is used to prevent Pokemon from setting up by using Taunt, spread status in the form of Toxic, and also Dragon Dance Scraggy. Without Mienfoo, Dragon Dance Scraggy would be able to run over the whole team with ease. Stunky's main role is to eliminate Ghost-type Pokemon (mainly Misdreavus and Gastly). It can comfortably switch in on the those two aforementioned Pokemon, and proceed to checkmate them with either Sucker Punch (if they attack) or Pursuit (if they switch). Stunky also carries Crunch as it provides both consistency and power. Once Stunky successfully eliminates the Ghost-types, Stunky is no longer of use and is usually used to dent the next Pokemon switching in with a powerful Explosion. The final Pokemon of the core is Misdreavus itself. Misdreavus can switch into Fighting-type Pokemon easily, and begin setting up. Elevator Music runs an unusual Misdreavus set, consisting of both Nasty Plot and Will-O-Wisp. Few people expect this, and will immediately switch in their Stunky into Misdreavus's Nasty Plot, only to get burned the following turn. During the round, Staryu's usage went up, meaning Misdreavus also acted as a spin-blocker. Keeping hazards on the opposing field for any team is invaluable, and it is no different for Elevator Music's team.
</p>
 
<h2>Sweepers</h2>
 
<p>There is no real sweeper on this team, but Misdreavus comes close as the main sweeper. After one Nasty Plot, Misdreavus reaches a whopping 36 Special Attack. This is further enhanced by Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting, two moves that complement each other well, as they hit every Pokemon in the tier for at least neutral damage. Physical sweepers are severely hampered by Will-O-Wisp, and this often means an extra Nasty Plot under Misdreavus's belt. Coupled with entry hazards in the form of both Stealth Rock and Spikes, Nasty Plot Misdreavus is a real force to be reckoned with.
</p>
 
<h2>Threats</h2>
 
<p>Powerful special attackers can put the hurt on Elevator Music's team. Pokemon such as Houndour and Snover are tough to defeat considering that a Houndour carrying Fire Blast, Sucker Punch, and Dark Pulse can OHKO or 2HKO every single member of the team. The only Pokemon on Elevator Music's team that resists STAB Blizzard from Snover is Slowpoke, which is 2HKOed by Giga Drain. On the whole, aside from these hard-hitting special attackers, Elevator Music deals with most common threats without much problems, and is one of the main reasons why Elevator Music's team fares extremely well against other teams.</p>
 
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
 
<p>Elevator Music shows that entry hazards along with a solid core is one of the hardest things to overcome on the battlefield. Elevator Music's team is one of the most thought out and well-built teams, and this showed in practice as he constantly maintained the top spot on the leaderboard throughout the entire round. Overall, Elevator Music's team is excellent, and is a great example of succeeding during the fourth round of Little Cup suspect testing.</p>
