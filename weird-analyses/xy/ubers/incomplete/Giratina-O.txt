    Overview
    ########

    -massive hp and decent defenses allow it to sponge attacks well
    -griseous orb boosts its good offenses, but somewhat limits its versatility
    -3 immunities, therefore gets many switch-in opportunities
    -great defogger due to the above + SR neutrality and immunity to all other hazards thanks to levitate, also beats many common taunt users 1v1 (e.g. deoxys-s, mewtwo, thundurus)
    -no reliable recovery is a major shortcoming when compared to other common defog users (e.g. arceus forms)
    -type chart changes are a mixed bag; gained fairy weakness but ghost STAB is now much more potent offensively
    -solid check to many common threats (e.g. EK arceus, groudon, blaziken)
    -still blocks rapid spin
    -laughs at mega gengar


    Physical Defog
    ########

    name: Physical Defog
    move 1: Defog
    move 2: Shadow Sneak
    move 3: Dragon Tail
    move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Earthquake / Stone Edge
    ability: Levitate
    item: Griseous Orb
    evs: 252 Atk / 248 Def / 8 SpD
    nature: Adamant


    Moves
    ========

    -defog removes hazards of course, giratina-o is one of the best users of it for the reasons mentioned above (isn't hazard weak, can beat many taunt users)
    -shadow sneak is a solid priority/STAB move made even stronger by griseous orb
    -dragon tail is put to great use on giratina-o as it forces a lot of switches, also lets giratina-o check several boosting sweepers remarkably well
    -will-o-wisp permanently cripples physical attackers, and is more appealing than ever as it had its accuracy buffed to 85% this gen
    -earthquake is a moderately powerful attack without negative priority, allows giratina-o to hit things that would normally wall this set easily such as aegislash and heatran
    -stone edge is an option to OHKO ho-oh, which would otherwise wall this set and can repeatedly switch into dragon tail with impunity if stealth rock isn't up thanks to regenerator
    -shadow force is a much stronger ghost-type STAB option, and is notably able to hit through king's shield
    -thunder wave and toxic are alternative status options for the last slot that can cripple fast and bulky switch-ins, respectively
    -magic coat can be useful vs taunt users in particular, but also as protection against things like toxic as giratina-o is a common target of status


    Set Details
    ========

    -max attack lets its STABs hit as hard as possible, making dragon tail that much better for shuffling
    -max attack also gives it a very strong priority move, notably guarantees the 2HKO on 0/4 mewtwo
    -248 defense guarantees it survives a +2 LO shadow claw from max attack normal arceus, and helps it take hits better overall as it will usually be switching in to check physical threats


    Usage Tips
    ========

    -switch in on one of your 3 immunities or 6 resistances and use defog if needed, revenge/phaze/burn things otherwise
    -dragon tail spam isn't as effective this gen due to the introduction of fairies; should be used cautiously
    -revenge things like mewtwo and deoxys forms, as well as low hp mons in general, with shadow sneak
    -it's often important to keep giratina-o alive to phaze the dangerous boosting sweepers it handles so well (e.g. SD groundceus, blaziken, offensive groudon, ekiller) rather than constantly switching in and using defog


    Team Options
    ========

    -ho-oh loves defog support and can take a lot of the dark/ghost/ice/dragon/fairy moves aimed at giratina-o, as the majority will be special
    -stealth rock complements dragon tail nicely (though obviously you may not want to use defog if your own rocks are already down) - reliable stealth rock users such as dialga work well with giratina-o
    -groudon in particular can set up stealth rock and wall many of the physically-based dragons that force giratina-o out
    -pokemon that handle fairies well are great partners, e.g. aegislash, jirachi, bronzong, metagross (three of which can also set up SR, and all of which also have a valuable dragon resistance)
    -similarly, steelceus and poisonceus can help deal with fairies, particularly if they have roar
    -klefki walks all over xerneas/yveltal and can support with thunder wave/spikes
    -tyranitar can beat dark-types lacking a fighting move and ho-oh


    Mixed
    ########

    name: Mixed
    move 1: Draco Meteor
    move 2: Shadow Sneak
    move 3: Dragon Tail
    move 4: Toxic / Defog
    ability: Levitate
    item: Griseous Orb
    evs: 180 Atk / 252 SpA / 76 Spe
    nature: Rash


    Moves
    ========

    -draco meteor hits extremely hard with max spa and the griseous orb boost, and is able to severely dent common switch-ins to giratina-o and/or opponents expecting a physical set (e.g. physically defensive yveltal takes 60-70%)
    -shadow sneak is once again used as a strong priority STAB move that hits many ubers super effectively
    -dragon tail is used for phazing/shuffling and does a decent amount of damage, especially with the listed attack investment
    -toxic is an option to cripple common switch-ins, such as xerneas and support arceus
    -defog can be used to clear hazards
    -shadow ball warrants a special mention as a reliable, spammable STAB attack that can be used over draco meteor in order to hit fairy- and steel-types
    -a ton of other support options are available for the last slot, including will-o-wisp and thunder wave
    -similarly, a number of attacking options are available depending on your team's needs, such as stone edge, earthquake, and thunder/thunderbolt

    Set Details
    ========

    -max spa is used to make draco meteor hit as hard as possible
    -a minimum investment of 100 atk EVs is needed to guarantee the 2HKO on mega mewtwo Y with shadow sneak
    -76 speed EVs are used to outspeed 0 speed yveltal, draco meteor does roughly 60-70% to 252/0 yveltal
    -remaining 80 EVs are placed in attack to make dragon tail and shadow sneak hit harder, though they can also be placed in defense in order to help giratina-o check physical threats better

    Other Options
    ########

    -roar can be used over dragon tail or in the flexible last slot of each set for its ability to hit geoxern, an extremely common giratina-o switch in, and ideally make it waste its power herb (also useful for its perfect accuracy and ability to hit through substitute)
    -iron head can be used with thunder wave for a gimmicky geoxern lure
    -similarly, iron tail hits fairies hard but its accuracy is unappealing
    -rest is giratina-o's only form of recovery and can be used with cleric support
    -a purely special set is an option (though the loss of shadow sneak and dragon tail hurts); giratina-o has great special attacking options such in draco meteor, dragon pulse, shadow ball, calm mind, aura sphere, thunder/thunderbolt, earth power, and hidden power fire

    ########

    -xerneas
    -yveltal
    -darkrai
