<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Drill Peck is an oft-forgotten move in the competitive environment, usually because of the existence of Brave Bird and its much greater power, as well as the fact that most users of Drill Peck also have access to Brave Bird regardless. The only exception to this rule is Fearow, who is really the only Pokemon you will see this move used with.</p>
