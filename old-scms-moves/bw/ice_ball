<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The user is locked into this move and cannot make another move until it misses, 5 turns have passed, or the attack cannot be used. Power doubles with each successful hit of this move and doubles again if Defense Curl was used previously by the user. If this move is called by Sleep Talk, the move is used for one turn. After five turns have passed, or if the user fails to use the move successfully, the Base Power resets to 30.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Ice Ball has little competitive use. It takes too many turns to reach a worthwhile power level, and its distribution is exceedingly small.</p>
