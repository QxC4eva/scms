<div id="interview">

<div class="aside">
<p>It's a cold day in San Diego, and before me is a gigantic structure that can only be described as a tower. The sleek black structure appears as slick as glass, although who really knows. At the top floor is my quarry. I glance down at the note in my hand that was unexpectedly left on my office desk two days ago. The note reads:</p>

<p>"<em>After having to suffer indignation from Philip, his 7085 brothers, and his cheerleaders, I'm rewarding myself with a vacation to Australia. You do this one.</em>"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~Mekkah</p>

<p>I curse under my breath. A strong wind picks up and blows the note out of my hand and onto the door of the tower before me. I look up to take in the structure, and it seems to stretch so far into the heavens that the clouds move <em>around</em> it.</p>

<p>As I walk up a flight of stairs to knock, the door swings open and a very large man that could only be described as a bear greets me. He tells me in a very gruff voice to follow him into the elevator, and I do. When I reach the top floor, I realize that the room I'm now in is shaped as a large glass dome and situated well into the Earth's upper troposphere. Before me sit two men in lounge chairs with Nintendo DSi's in hand. They stop and eye me with wide smirks stretching across their faces.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Sit, please!</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>As if from nowhere, a chair emerged from the floor in front of me. I take the hint and sit down in the rather comfortable chair. Placing my hands gingerly in my lap, I grin as I recall that unlike Mekkah, my memory doesn't suck and I can remember the interview without writing on Jimbo's enormous form.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Alright, so first thing's first, can you shed some light on your backgrounds? Where are you both from? Age? Occupation? Hobbies? The works.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Huy sets down his DSi on a pedestal that emerged from the floor next to his chair and leans back, clearly to demonstrate how relaxed he is.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>My birthday is next week... What should I say?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>A man rushes over, seeming to have also appeared out of the floor, and whispers in makiri's right ear over the shoulder of his chair.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I am 22 at the moment, and I'm pretty much a big slacker. The job market in California is pretty awful because of the recession, so at the moment I am not employed, but I am going to school for now hoping to finish with a degree in nursing.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I look around the large tower, wondering how he managed to set himself up here while being simultaneously unemployed...</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I'm a big fan of sports and music. I listen to basically every genre there is, from J-Pop to rap, if I like the music I listen to it. I also watch loads of tennis and various other American sports.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>I know the feeling. That's how I am with music, too.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Background... Well, I've lived in northern California for the entirety of my 21 years and I'm currently a 4th year Biochemistry major at UC Davis. Other than Pokemon battling, I'm an avid Street Fighter player and Pokemon collector.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>So you're both from California? Is that how you met each other and why people say you're like two peas in a pod?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>We actually didn't meet in real life until the summer of 2009. But for a long time on Smogon, we were among the few West Coast people on the site, so we chatted a lot.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Our background is kind of funny&mdash;we got paired together in a tournament and had no idea who the other person was. We clicked during our battle... Which I should have won if not for that lame Static paralysis on my Kingler.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Haha. Yeah, my Pikachu Static'd his Kingler and won it for me. We've been friends since then; we just get along so well and have so many common interests.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Haha, awesome. What kind of battle was it?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>It was an RPT tournament called the 219 ways of death and was run by ricepigeonkkm.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Sounds interesting, although I have no clue what that&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Before I could finish, Huy interjected as though he could read my very thoughts.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>...we were randomly assigned 8 Pokemon based on numbers.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I nod in understanding and look slightly confused by his omniscience.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Both teams were probably really bad as you can tell by a Pikachu beating a Kingler.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Yeah, hah. Seems like it must have been fun, though, so who cares.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Yeah, it was a really fun tournament. I thought I had a cakewalk since his username had all those numbers and all, but nooo.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Huy rolls his eyes visibly at makiri, who scowls in response.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Now, I know that you're both into the VGC community and that you both did well for yourselves last season. Tell me, what is the experience like being part of such a community?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Huy's eyes seem to glow at the mention of VGC.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>The community is what makes VGC so great. It's such a different experience to do what you're passionate about with people who share the same love for the game.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I've always been interested in battling at the official tournaments. I missed out on the JAA and the Emerald Tournament in Seattle, but in '08 I joined and made Worlds placing second in LA. I told Huy about it the next year and forced him to join. He won with a team I made for myself, surprisingly. I just wanted him to test it!</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Yeah, he gave me a team like a week before and told me to run with it and it just sort of snowballed. I wasn't expecting to get anywhere in '09, but having zwing behind me really helped.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Since then, he's come into his own and we're both major pioneers in the metagame, which is really cool.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>That's really exciting! Now, makiri, you say you're both pioneers? Can you elaborate a bit on what you mean by that?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Well, last year is a perfect example of us being pioneers. In Seattle we decided to run the now infamous TopOgre team, and it performed so well that many other people picked up on it and won or placed really well at other tournaments.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>I've heard of that! That was you who started it?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Yeah! It was actually a joint effort between the two of us.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>That's really cool, actually.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Most people give me the credit because I won with it, but we both put tons of effort into creating that team.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Hitmontop even ended up on the poster for Worlds 2010 because of it. That must make you both really proud.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Yeah, that wasn't something I was expecting.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I only just now notice that Huy is signing papers on a suited man's back. The papers appear to have Cresselia logos on them. I decide to wait a moment and listen to makiri some more before throwing out the next question.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Oh yeah, the following Hitmontop got from it was amazing. I really enjoyed making an uncommon UU Pokemon such a major factor in a game filled with Ubers.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Sorry, I'm back now.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Always late to the party...</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Huy shoots makiri a glare that could cut butter.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>So, while we're on the subject of VGC, I'm curious about what you two think of the VGC 2011 rules? Only Unova Pokemon and all.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>It's a change of pace. It's almost as centralized as RBY, but with no old Pokemon to fall back on. It's going to require some thinking and lots of work to make a new TopOgre or ZapChomp.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>I really like it. It's forcing a lot of people out of their comfort zone and making them try new things. It's fun seeing all these new Pokemon trying to fill the roles of the older Pokemon.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I wait for a moment for more from either of them, though their lips seem tightly sealed on the matter. I frame my next question carefully to see if I can get some juicier details out of the pair.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Without spoiling your planned strategies, any ideas what we should be on the lookout for this season?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Trick Room is going to be a very prominent strategy this year. It's so much easier to set up with the new properties of Mental Herb.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Lots of help from Gob.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Sensing the confusion in my facial expressions, makiri elaborates.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>He's a character from Arrested Development. He's really into illusions.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Steelicks and Jimbo will be really happy to hear that the big, slow 'mons are going to be some of the hardest to stop.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Jimbo sure could be a bit more useful this year.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>We all laugh at the thought of Jimbo being useful.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>And what about weather, seeing as it was so popular in VGC 2010? Without any of the permanent weather starters available, how do you think it'll fare?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>It's up in the air. There isn't much that takes advantage of any of the weathers. I've played around with rain and sun, but it just isn't as effective without old mainstays like Kingdra or Jumpluff.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Yeah, there are only a few Pokemon that can take advantage of the weather and even fewer that can effectively set it up.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>So it'll be a strong, bulky metagame with little weather and lots of trickery. Sounds exciting.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I think it will be.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>It's definitely going to be exciting to see what starts popping up at regionals.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Maybe you two were expecting this, but I just have to know. What <em>are</em> the Mighty Ducks?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Oh man! Originally the ducks started off as "Team Bianca", and then grew into "Team Goblet" during Nationals of '09. It was just a name we gave our small group that related to a bunch of inside jokes.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>It really started as a gimmick. Huy was wondering what to name his Pokemon for Worlds '09, and eventually he settled on characters from the Mighty Ducks movies. While he was battling a group of us began a duck chant, and it really evolved from a small group of friends into what we are today: a large group of friends. We of course battle and train lots, but our primary focus is getting together.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>As he finishes speaking, I notice banners with the Mighty Ducks logo descend from the tops of the windows along the sides of the dome.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>And now it's a full community that trains together and has major representation at Worlds. That's really impressive. It's funny how stuff like that works out.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I really never expected what became of us. If you saw a duck shirt, you were scared of what might come next.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Feared throughout the land, eh?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Yeah! The best part of the whole duck gimmick is that The Pokemon Company plays along with it. The MC even started a duck chant for us in Seattle.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Hah!</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I'm not sure whether they like us or not, because we do so well at Regionals and other tournaments. I think they really enjoy what we've been bringing publicity-wise for them, though.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Yeah, that sounds about right.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Yeah, even IGN started asking us what the deal was!</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>It takes a bit of courage to ask the next question, but I blurt it out after a bit of thought.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Do I get a T-shirt for this interview?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Haha, we'll talk to our publicity manager and see if he can hook you up.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I do a shallow fistpump and makiri winks. In the meantime, I notice that Huy is making hand motions in the air and one of the suited men in the room is scrambling about as if he's looking for something.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>I've always thought about trying VGC, but it's kind of a scary prospect jumping into a fluid group like that. Any recommendations for newcomers?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Sleep with our manager.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>The suited man that was flailing about stops dead in his tracks and stares blankly at makiri with his jaw open and head slightly hanging.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Just get in there and don't be afraid to make mistakes. The community is more than willing to help newcomers learn the game.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>...or you can do what Huy said.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>The suited man sighs a sigh of relief and returns to looking for whatever he was looking for.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>There was a huge spike in new players last year and they've all planted themselves firmly in the community.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I recall my next question after a brief respite and lean back in my chair with a smile as I ask it.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>VGC was only recently recognized by Smogon as an official metagame, as you're both well aware. Here's your chance to speak out: if you had chaos and his beard on a leash, what would you do to better represent VGC here at Smogon?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I would love to see more VGC tournaments. Representation in the tour would be a great start, too. There is already a slot in SPL, which is great.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Yeah, I'm really enjoying VGC in SPL.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Yeah, I saw that. Are you both kicking butt and taking names?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>I'm not the 5th highest paid player for nothing!</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>The building we're in makes a lot more sense to me after a statement like that.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I decided to move on to bigger and better things than playing by being the manager of the Stark Sharks. I write the paychecks.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Is Huy on your team?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Haha! He wishes he could afford me!</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I wish, but because he cost so much during the draft I had to settle for sixonesix... who isn't that bad himself.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Yeah, there are a lot of players who flew under the radar simply because people don't play VGC enough to know better.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Yeah, and then costed less than they were worth, I imagine.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I actually think there was inflation because of the lack of knowledge. Almost every VGC player had gone above the average salary. ninahaza went for 9k and he didn't even sign up!</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Haha. Well, we've been going on here for a while, so I have one last question for you all before we part ways...</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I didn't do it!</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I look at him confusedly, and watch as the suited manager fellow charges across the room to makiri's side. They exchange whispers, and the suited man walks off and makes a phone call.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>If I asked you two to battle right now with VGC 2011 rules, who would win?
</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>makiri points to himself confidently.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I would definitely win; I'm currently 4-0 against my partner here.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Hah! I'm like 0-4 against him..</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Huy looks more than a little sad as he makes this confession.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Ouch! Pikachu always triumphs over Kingler, eh? I'll make a mental note of that for C&C when I cycle back around. Anything else you guys would like to say before we go?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>makiri makes some crazy gestures with his hands and starts spouting out names in a gangster accent.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>Shout outs to all my bros: Big J, K-Town, and true niggaz don't give a f*@&!</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Love out to WiFi for providing me all 'da sweet 'mons for VGC! Also a shout out to andrea as my favorite trade thread partner!</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>God bless and good night, my man.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I stand up and thank them for all of their hard work and thought out responses. I turn towards the elevator, and both the publicity manager and several huge bodyguards stand next to it. As I walk towards it, I'm called after by a now standing makiri...</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I'm surprised you didn't ask about my name!</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Oh?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>No one actually knows what it means! They see the name and wonder that it's awfully girly. I used to get confused for jumpluff.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I notice that the suited men behind me are clenching their fists and decide to play along with makiri for my own safety.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>It also changes a lot, so I've noticed. zerowing was the original, right?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>zerowing1991 was. I dropped the numbers in 2007, and then changed to this in 2010.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Huy looks up from signing more Cresselia-stamped papers to chime in.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker huy"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_huy.png" alt="Huy" /><p>Bring back zerowing1991!</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker makiri"><img src="/media/smog/14/interview_makiri.png" alt="makiri" /><p>I dropped the numbers because people thought I was born in 1991, which was kind of infuriating. Last year I changed to makiri because I thought it was a cool name and kind of cute. katya had gotten me into tennis last year and the first match I watched was <strong>Ma</strong>ria <strong>Kiri</strong>lenko vs Maria Sharapova. It's kind of silly looking back, but I love the name despite all of the pleas to go back to zerowing. It makes people take me less seriously when I battle.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker dusk"><img src="/media/smog/interview_dusk.jpg" alt="Rising_Dusk" /><p>Aha, it all makes sense now! Alright, well, unless there are any other questions you'd like me to ask, that's that.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I wait for a good half-minute before turning back to the elevator and the waiting guards. All I can think of while walking into the elevator heading for the ground floor is if this manager fellow is going to give me a T-shirt or not.</p></div>
