<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The best Pokemon is one who is obtained at the start of the game, can OHKO enemies off the bat, and only loses 1 HP when damaged. It also learns every HM, heals itself automatically, and has some neat ability to top it off. Such a Pokemon doesn't exist, of course, but this means that Pokemon closer to this ideal are the best.</p>

<p>The goal of this in-game tier list is to recommend a select group of Pokemon for an efficient run-through of the game. Those will be put in High tier. Very inefficient Pokemon will be put in Low tier. Pokemon who are neither efficient nor inefficient – for example, Pokemon who have an initial downside but can eventually perform as well as High tiered ones – are put in Middle tier. [the intent of this sentence was confusing but by skimming the list I came up with that description.</p>

<p>Pokemon are graded based on five factors: availability, raw stats, movepool, typing, and matchups against major in-game battles. Availability is a measure of how easy it is to obtain the Pokemon, and it ranges from very low (gift Pokemon) to very high (common "tall grass" Pokemon). It also takes into account the part of the game at which you are able to get the Pokemon. For example, a Pokemon could be extremely good, but he is worthless if you get him after every major battle. Raw stats affect the Pokemon's ability to KO others and to take hits in-game. Obviously, you want Pokemon with great stats, since that means they can easily KO many other Pokemon without fainting.</p>

<p>A Pokemon's movepool is the variety of attacks the Pokemon learns. Does it need a lot of TMs to have a good moveset? Can it learn a lot of HMs to help you navigate in the overworld? Does he learn powerful attacks of his own type? TMs are available but can only be used once. Giving items like Super Potions is fine because you can buy them and you have almost infinite money in the game. Giving a Pokemon a TM like the Dig TM in RBY cannot simply be assumed, as there is lots of competition for that TM. The less competition there is for a TM, the more likely it is that a Pokemon can get said TM. Pokemon with great movepools do not present much competition for TMs, allowing them to be used on other Pokemon (However, a buyable TM can always be assumed).</p>

<p>Typing and matchups go hand in hand. The optimal typing gives a Pokemon STAB on useful attack types while leaving it with few or no weaknesses. If a Pokemon is a dual type, his typing should complement it offensively and defensively. Typing also determines the major battles in which a Pokemon will be useful (major battles can range from Gym Leaders battles to Rival battles). Therefore, it is useful to use Pokemon with good type combinations that give them an advantage in most of the game's major battles.</p>

<p>Don't confuse an efficient run with a speed run. Speed runs are often segmented and recorded while manipulating luck through resets; these aim for the absolute fastest on-screen time, but the real time spent on them is much, much more. If you want to play through the game in a relatively low time frame, then you're looking for an efficient run.</p>

<p>A team is actually the most efficient (in terms of utility per team member) if it only consists of a single member; however, this tier list will assume a team size of around three Pokemon. Otherwise, the list would be extremely centralized around starters and early-game Pokemon while everything else would be too crappy to use. Also note when reading through this guide that some of the moves and abilities listed for a Pokemon may only be obtained by their evolutions. Some Pokemon may be placed in higher tiers due to their evolutions capabilities as well.</p>

<h2><a name="high">High Tier</a></h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/63.png" alt="Abra" /><br />
<strong>Abra</strong><br />
Availability: Early<br />
Stats: High<br />
Movepool: Decent<br />

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/170.png" alt="Chinchou" /><br />
<strong>Chinchou</strong><br />
Availability: Late<br />
Stats: Above Average<br />
Movepool: Wide<br />
Additional Comments: Lanturn has passable stats and Water/Electric is an awesome STAB combo.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/309.png" alt="Electrike" /><br />
<strong>Electrike</strong><br />
Availability: Early<br />
Stats: Above Average<br />
Movepool: Shallow<br />
Additional Comments: Fast and strong; Bite + Thunderbolt offers great neutral coverage.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/383.png" alt="Groudon" /><br />
<strong>Groudon (Ruby Only)</strong><br />
Availability: Late<br />
Stats: Excellent<br />
Movepool: Wide<br />
Additional Comments: Comes late at a high level, but is incredibly strong and sweeps easily with Bulk Up + STAB Earthquake. Drought also removes its Water weakness and it has Fire Blast to crush Grass- and Ice-type Pokemon. In Emerald, it doesn't come until after you beat the Champion.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/382.png" alt="Kyogre" /><br />
<strong>Kyogre (Sapphire Only)</strong><br />
Availability: Late<br />
Stats: Excellent<br />
Movepool: Wide<br />
Additional Comments: Comes late at a high level, but is incredibly strong and can sweep the Elite Four pretty much by itself with a moveset of Calm Mind / Ice Beam / Hydro Pump / Thunder (it comes with three of those moves). In Emerald, it doesn't come until after you beat the Champion.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/270.png" alt="Lotad" /><br />
<strong>Lotad (Sapphire and Emerald only)</strong><br />
Availability: Very Early<br />
Stats: Average<br />
Movepool: Decent<br />
Additional Comments: Dual STABs have great coverage without need for TMs, while his typing doesn't leave him with many weaknesses. It's easy to get as well.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/258.png" alt="Mudkip" /><br />
<strong>Mudkip</strong><br />
Availability: Beginning<br />
Stats: Above Average<br />
Movepool: Wide<br />
Additional Comments: Learns a lot of HMs, is bulky, and is strong. His dual STAB combo offers great coverage when coupled with Blizzard, which is an easily purchased TM.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/280.png" alt="Ralts" /><br />
<strong>Ralts</strong><br />
Availability: Very Early<br />
Stats: Above Average<br />
Movepool: Decent<br />
Additional Comments: Very strong, moderately fast, and has a pretty good movepool. Psychic + Thunderbolt is a good attacking combo to use, especially since Ralts gets Calm Mind as a level-up move.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/384.png" alt="Rayquaza" /><br />
<strong>Rayquaza (Emerald only)</strong><br />
Availability: Late<br />
Stats: Excellent<br />

<strong>Skarmory</strong><br />
Availability: Mid-game<br />
Stats: Above Average<br />
Movepool: Shallow<br />
Additional Comments: Excellent typing lets it take many hits, and it outright walls a lot of the game's more deadly Trainers, such as Norman, Winona, Steven, Sidney, and Phoebe. You should also have the Steel Wing TM as soon as you find it, meaning that it can pull its weight very quickly.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/120.png" alt="Staryu" /><br />
<strong>Staryu</strong><br />
Availability: Late<br />
Stats: Above Average<br />
