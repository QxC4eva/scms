[SHORT DESC]
Lowers the PP of the move used last by 4.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The last move used by the target has its PP reduced by 4. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute. Fails if the target has not made a move, if the move has 0 PP, or if it no longer knows the move. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Spite's ability to deduct 4 PP per turn alongside the PP used to attack your Pokemon in the first place can prove devastating against attacks that have high Base Power but low PP, such as Hydro Pump and Fire Blast. However, most potential users of Spite, such as Giratina, Dusknoir, and Spiritomb, would rather use the moveslot for one of their many other useful status attacks or for extra coverage. Spite sounds nice on paper, but in practice, it isn't very useful at all.</p>
