[Overview]

<p>Ever since its release, Togekiss has been best known for being one of the two "hax" Pokemon, with the other being Jirachi. The combination of Serene Grace, a paralysis move, access to Roost, and a STAB move with a 30% flinch chance leaves the opponent with only a 30% chance to attack, which makes Togekiss almost impossible to take out. All in all, it one of the most infuriating Pokemon in the game. That is not all, though; Togekiss can also run an effective Nasty Plot set, as it is one of the few Pokemon with access to the move. Combine that with a very respectable base 120 Special Attack stat, and you get a Pokemon that can lay down the hurt on unprepared teams. Unfortunately, Togekiss isn't without its flaws. Its weakness to Stealth Rock is a crippling one, as it means Togekiss will lose a quarter of its health every time it switches in. While Togekiss does have access to Roost, the fast-paced nature of the DW metagame makes it hard for it to use Roost often. Additionally, its below-average base 80 Speed stat also leaves Togekiss easily revenge killed.</p>

move 2: Air Slash

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to make the most of Serene Grace. As mentioned earlier, the combination of paralysis and a 60% flinch chance leaves the opponent with only a 30% chance to actually do something. Togekiss can usually take out several Pokemon all by itself if luck is on your side, as it can be hard to KO especially due to Roost and its good bulk.</p>

<p>Thunder Wave provides a reliable way of spreading paralysis, unlike Body Slam, which only paralyzes 60% of the time. Body Slam also doesn't hit Ghost-types, but has the advantage of hitting Ground-types such as Excadrill and Landorus, and is not shut down by Taunt. Air Slash is Togekiss's main STAB move, as it has a high flinch rate as well as good power. Aura Sphere is the best option in the third slot, as it provides great coverage alongside Air Slash, and hits Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Heatran for super effective damage. However, Flamethrower hits several notable Steel-types, such as Jirachi, Genesect, and Skarmory, for greater damage. Roost is in the last slot to enhance Togekiss's longevity, especially when combined with the fact that the opponent will rarely be able to attack every turn.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are geared towards maximizing Togekiss's excellent special bulk; in conjunction with its typing, this lets Togekiss take on DW behemoths such as Genesect and Chandelure. The Defense EVs ensure that +2 Jolly Air Balloon Excadrill will not KO Togekiss with Rock Slide, which can be useful if your team has some problems with it. However, you can drop the Defense EVs and instead go with a simple 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD EV spread. If you feel that mono-Flying coverage is enough for Togekiss to take down most Pokemon, Nasty Plot is an option over the coverage move. Togekiss can often find a free turn to set up, and this lets it take down opposing Pokemon with Air Slash a lot more easily.<p>

<p>While this set doesn't have that many counters considering most Pokemon can usually be taken out by a couple of flinches, there are some threats who do give this set a lot of trouble. Zapdos takes little damage from both Air Slash and Aura Sphere, and can threaten Togekiss with a powerful Thunderbolt. Jirachi isn't bothered by anything but Flamethrower and can take down Togekiss with its own paraflinching combination, thanks to its higher Speed. Specially defensive Heatran makes for a good partner, as it can take both Zapdos's and Jirachi's assaults quite easily and threaten them with Toxic and Lava Plume, respectively. Jirachi is another good partner for Togekiss, not because it is able to deal with the aforementioned problem Pokemon, but because it makes for a good "hax" core with it—both Pokemon are able to paralyze opponents and flinch them to death.</p>

[SET]
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Air Slash
move 3: Aura Sphere / Heal Bell
move 4: Roost / Fire Blast
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
ability: Serene Grace

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set doesn't focus as much on Serene Grace, but instead aims to set up and pull off a sweep. Nasty Plot doubles Togekiss's Special Attack in one use, letting it quickly get very threatening. With its excellent bulk, it can often find an opportunity to set up. There are two ways to go with this set: defensive and offensive. The defensive variant focuses on Togekiss's excellent bulk to find an opportunity to set up a Nasty Plot or even two, while the offensive variant focuses on Togekiss's great base 120 Special Attack along with its excellent coverage.</p> 

<p>Air Slash is a given on both variants, as it's Togekiss best STAB move, and further packs a 60% flinch chance. Aura Sphere is the best option in the third slot, as it provides great coverage and hits notable Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Heatran, hard. Defensive variants can also consider Heal Bell in this slot, as the ability to cure itself of status lets Togekiss set up on Blissey. Roost is a mandatory last move for the defensive variant, but offensive sets can use Fire Blast for more coverage, as KOing Jirachi among others can be very useful.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of item and EV spread depends on the variant. The defensive variant is better off using Leftovers, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe, and a Modest nature for good bulk and power. The offensive variant, on the other hand, should use a Life Orb to boost the power of its attacks, along with a 112 HP / 4 Def / 156 SpA / 236 Spe EV spread and a Timid nature. Those EVs let Togekiss outspeed Adamant Lucario and always KO Gliscor at +2, while also providing it with a Life Orb number.</p>

<p>While this set is rather powerful, certain Pokemon are still able to wall it reliably. Chansey and Blissey can take on Togekiss without Heal Bell thanks to their incredible special bulk and Toxic. Specially defensive Dragonite can take a hit, especially if Multiscale is intact, and use Dragon Tail to phaze out Togekiss and rack up entry hazard damage. Mamoswine makes for a good teammate as it is able to take down both of these threats thanks to its high base Attack and powerful STAB moves.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Togekiss can run a rather effective Choice Scarf set, as Air Slash takes down most opponents in a few hits, and Trick cripples walls such as Blissey and Jirachi switching in. However, Thunder Wave is usually a better way of taking care of Togekiss's below-average Speed, as several Pokemon outspeed even Choice Scarf Togekiss. Togekiss can also run an effective Baton Pass set as it is one of the few Pokemon that can pass Nasty Plot boosts, but it is generally outclassed by Mew in such a role.</p>

<p>Hustle Togekiss is somewhat viable; while it has a rather pathetic base 50 Attack, STAB ExtremeSpeed is definitely nothing to scoff at when combined with Hustle. Work Up can help boost its Attack even more and let it KO several offensively inclined Pokemon, such as Thundurus, Blaziken, and Breloom. However, anything that resists it can revenge kill Togekiss quite easily, and Excadrill, Genesect, and Chandelure all do. It also lacks power, and will not be able to take down bulkier Pokemon such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Scizor. Finally, Grass Knot can be used on the Nasty Plot set to hit Gastrodon and Unaware Quagsire, but it has little use otherwise, so it's almost always an inferior option.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Zapdos is likely the best Togekiss counter out there, as it resists both Air Slash and Aura Sphere, is immune to Thunder Wave thanks to Lightningrod, and can threaten Togekiss with a powerful STAB Thunderbolt. Raikou works similarly, but doesn't resist Aura Sphere. Jirachi also resists Air Slash and is neutral to Aura Sphere; it can take out Togekiss with its own paraflinching strategy thanks to its higher base Speed. Blissey and Chansey can take on Togekiss that lack Heal Bell—if they manage to Toxic it, they can simply Softboiled until Togekiss faints.</p>

<p>If all else fails, revenge killing Togekiss is always possible. Powerful physical attackers that outspeed Togekiss, such as Terrakion, Haxorus, and Salamence, can take it out. However, they need to be careful while switching in, as they are crippled by Thunder Wave. Garchomp and Mamoswine can both switch in on Thunder Wave freely thanks to their Ground typing, and threaten to KO Togekiss with a powerful STAB move.</p>
