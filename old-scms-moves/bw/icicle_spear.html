[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. It has a 1/3 chance for the move to hit either 2 or 3 times, and a 1/6 chance to hit either 4 or 5 times. If a Focus Sash or the ability Sturdy is activated through one of the hits, another hit will KO the target. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate for every hit taken, and every hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock, Razor Fang, or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. Color Change will only activate on the last hit of the move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat all the hits as a single attack. If this move breaks a Substitute, the attack can still continue and hurt the target. If the target holds a Yache, Jaboca, or Enigma Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. If the user has the ability Skill Link, this move will always hit five times.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Icicle Spear is a powerful, accurate multi-hit move. It is most commonly found on Cloyster, where it is paired with the Skill Link ability. This combination results in a 100% accurate 125 Base Power STAB move with no drawbacks, and a deadly weapon. Mamoswine can use this move with a Choice Scarf to serve as a check to Dragonite, whose Multiscale ability is circumvented by the multiple hits. However, Pokemon without Skill Link generally do not use this move since its damage output is unreliable.</p>
