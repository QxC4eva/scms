Overview
########

- Enjoys no more Drizzle SS ban but has less time to sweep because of the weather nerf
- Has access to SD to smash through nearly anything
- Decent dual STAB
- Low amount of coverage moves
- Has Rapid Spin and can use it in rain but loses to many ghosts (like Gourgeist) so should focus on sweeping
- Overall has a niche as a powerful rain sweeper able to boost his attack

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Low Kick/Aqua Jet/Rapid Spin
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk/4 Def/252 Spd

Moves
========

- SD to boost
- Waterfall is the strongest STAB under rain, capable of OHKOing Pokemon like Landorus-T after a boost, factoring Intimidate
- Stone Edge is secondary STAB with decent coverage, Hitting most Water resists
- Low Kick is good for Pokemon that resist his dual STAB like Ferrothorn
- Aqua Jet is strong priority for faster Scarfers like Terrakion
- Rapid Spin provides utility at the cost of coverage etc

Set Details
=======

- Swift Swim is why this thing is good because his speed is doubled under rain
- Life Orb provides power while allowing it to switch moves
- Adamant nature is for more power and you still outspeed everything important in rain, anything faster can take an Aqua Jet
- Normal physical sweeper EVs

Usage Tips
========

- This thing needs to be played as a late game sweeper in rain, since its the most powerful physical attackeing SSer
- Do not let it take a hit coming in or setting up or you may end up getting LO stalled, set up only when you get the right opporotunity
- Works best in some type of offensive core, or at least a way of removing its checks

Team Options
========

- POLITOED
- Ways to beat bulky grass types like Gourgeist or Ferrothorn (if not using Low Kick)
- Fire types beat most of his checks, but are weakened by rain, so more unconventional methods may work
- Hazards grant him many KOs, so SR setters are appreciated. Forretress can take hits for him, while in Rain Kabutops effectively 8x resists Fire
- Talonflame takes care of Gourgeist, Skarmory, Breloom, Virizion, and Mega Venusaur
- Conkeldurr beats Ferrothorn, and enjoys being Burned by Rotom-W which Kabutops hates
- Sylveon
- Landorus-T
- Scizor
- Rotom-W
