<h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<p>Finding all of the TMs in X and Y can be a difficult experience. You will end up traversing the whole map in order to find some of the more elusive TMs. This guide will aide you in finding all of the 100 TMs that are available in X and Y. A team consisting of HM users (Surf, Strength, Cut, and Waterfall) and a Rock Smasher will be very useful if not necessary in getting to many of them.</p>
 
<h3>Daily TMs</h3>
 
<p>There are two people in Kalos who give you four TMs over four days. The first of these is a lady on the port side of Coumarine to the north east of the area who gives you a TM based on a question she will ask each day (Acrobatics, Embargo, Trick Room, or Confide) and the other is a girl in the Anistar City Pok&eacutemon Center which gives you TMs based on the time of day (Double Team, Substitute, Flamethrower, or Psych Up).</p>
