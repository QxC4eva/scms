Has a high critical hit rate.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a critical hit rate one stage higher than normal. Assuming there are no other critical hit modifiers in play, this move has a 1/8 chance to get a critical hit instead of a 1/16 chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Not a common sight in the competitive scene. Note that it's not because it's a bad move, and actually it's a pretty decent one on paper, as it's a strong Ground-type attack with good accuracy and a high chance to land a critical hit. Unfortunately the merits end here; it has an average Base Power and is obscenely badly distributed, with Fearow and Rapidash being the only notable Pokemon that receive the move.</p>
