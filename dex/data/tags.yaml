        Composition
        ================
        
        OU (Overused) is Smogon's fundamental usage-based tier. With the exception of              Pokémon banished to the Uber tier, every Pokémon can be used in OU, including              Pokémon from UU, RU, and NU. While all non-Uber Pokémon can be used in OU, only            those Pokémon that make up at least ~3.41% of total weighted usage in the tier are         designated 'OU.' A Pokémon is truly 'OU' if a typical competitive player is more           than 50% likely to encounter that Pokemon at least once in a given day of playing          (20 battles).

        Composition
        ================
        
        Ubers is the most inclusive of Smogon's tiers, allowing the use of any Pokémon             species. Only abilities and tactics which have been proven to be uncompetitive are         banned from use. Ubers is not influenced by Pokémon usage in OU, UU, RU, or NU, and         the usage of Pokémon in Ubers has no influence on the compositions of those tiers.
