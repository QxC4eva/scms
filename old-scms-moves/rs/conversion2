[SHORT DESC]
Changes user into a new type that resists the last attack to hit the user.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Changes user into a new type that resists / is immune to the last attack to hit the user. Works even if the attack hits a Substitute. It only picks from types different from the current type of the user, meaning that if the Pok√©mon can change types and still resist the attack, it will change types.
