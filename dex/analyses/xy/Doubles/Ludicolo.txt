Overview
########

- Is an excellent Rain-based attacker
- 4x resist to Water-type moves also makes it a great Rain check, alongside its ability Swift Swim (or Rain Dish)
- Has access to Fake Out, which is a great way to disrupt your opponent's moves
- While it appreciates having Rain, it is by no means solely dependent on Rain, so you can use it in other weathers too
- On the downside, its typing means it misses out on some resists that come from its Rain or Grass typing, such as to Ice, Fire, and Electric
- Also, it's not frail, but not bulky either, so a powerful attack can put it in serious danger.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Fake Out
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: Ice Beam / Protect
ability: Swift Swim
item: Assault Vest / Lum Berry
evs: 104 HP / 252 SpA / 152 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
- Fake Out is one of the best moves in the tier, and being able to render an opposing Pokemon immobile is a great way to disrupt your opponent and potentially KO the Pokemon
- Hydro Pump is the main STAB, has great neutral coverage and is very powerful
- Giga Drain is secondary STAB, cool to hit Water-types such as Rotom-W and Azumarill, also recovers some health which can be useful to keep Ludicolo in a good percentage range
- Ice Beam hits Grass and Dragon-types that don't really mind a Hydro Pump or Giga Drain
- Protect shields you from damage when needed and can help you dodge a KO

Set Details
========
- The EV spread is able to outspeed up to Scarf Lando-T in Rain
- Assault Vest makes it even bulkier on the Special side, and works well since Ludicolo usually doesn't have room for Protect, as all the other moves are usually needed to make Ludicolo as effective as possible.
- Lum Berry is a good option since Ludicolo is frequently the target of Thunder Waves
- Life Orb adds power to nab some extra KOs but 10% recoil for every attack can bite, especially without Protect (10% to use Fake Out is brutal)
- Modest is the preferred nature for as much power as possible. Also, with Swift Swim you've already got a lot of speed.

Usage Tips
========
- Bringing in Ludicolo late game is a great strategy so it can clean up weakened teams with its Rain-boosted Speed and attacks
- Conserve Ludicolo if you see a Pokemon that is likely carrying Thunder Wave, such as Thundurus, as being hit by a Thunder Wave will ruin Ludicolo's sweeping capabilities.
- Fake Out is a great tool to pressure the opponent into making certain plays and create free turns for your partner.

Team Options
========
- Politoed is an amazing partner due to how much Ludicolo appreciates Rain. Also has Helping Hand to make up for Ludicolo's middling power level.
- Pokemon that appreciate Ludicolo's ability to handle Water-types, such as Landorus-Therian can make for good partners.
- Anything that appreciates the free turns bought by Fake Out could potentially be a good partner for Ludicolo.

Other Options

- Bulkier set w/ Sitrus Berry

Checks & Counters

- Scarf Genesect can outspeed Ludicolo even in Rain and hits it with powerful Bug-type attacks

- Thundurus can cripple Ludicolo with a Thunder Wave
- Bulky Trick Room setters such as Cresselia can turn Ludicolo's high speed under Rain into a liability.
