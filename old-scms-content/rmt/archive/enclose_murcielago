<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Man has it been a while since I posted a team here, if I recall correctly the last one was Heavenly Star, a bulky offense team based on synergy to work. You may know me as a reckless offense player, but lately i’ve been into some other stuff (dont wrong think this please). Basically, one day, when Latias was still around, a thought came to me after being slumping in Standard OU for a while. What if I change my style for a bit? Seemed kind of hard to completely change how you play from one day to the other, but I was willing to take this shot. This team, which may be my most succesful OU team, is based on the principle of layers and defense, call it “semistall” if you want (although I know some people rage at that term). Anyways, im basically retiring this, but feel free to shoot suggestions, as im sure theres some stuff that can be changed.</p>

<p>This team peaked #1 on the OU ladder, breaking 1710 CRE (and still rising!), with a mean rating of 1890+ and a Deviation of less than 50 on the account “Espada Ulquiorra”, it also went undefeated R1 in the World Cup of Pokemon. As of today it has lost very very few matches, making it the most solid and consistent team ive used.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/205.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Forretress</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Payback</p>

<p>Forretress may be my favorite lead on OU, and for a good damn reason, it can set up against a vast amount of other leads, come in later because of its massive resistances, and also provide spin support and a counter to stuff like no HP Fire Gengar.
In early game I really play cautiously with Forry, since layers are the main thing of this team, losing the set upper would be a huge hit to how it works. Mid game, I play it to the opposite, mostly recklessly without switching too much and just caring of getting either those layers missing or removing my opponent’s. Finally, on the late game I just use it as sacking fodder, since getting swept late game is more factible than either early or mid game, and Forry proves to be quite the set up fodder for offensive teams sometimes.
The EVs are from the Latias metagame, where Forries were supposed to run Special Defense in order to take on Specs Draco Meteors. Although both Latias and Mence are gone, I decided to keep this spread because youd be surprised how amazing it is to set up on defensive and Shadow Ball locked Rotom, most Vaporeons, Suicunes, Jirachis, Celebis, Shaymins, and the likes. The moveset talks by itself, using double layer there to hurt switch ins as most as possible, with Rapid Spin support, and Payback to hit ghosts. I have thought of using Gyro Ball in order to not only still hurt Gengar badly (in fact it hurts it more than Payback), but also hitting stuff like Flygon harder, yet Payback still appears as the most important option because of 1 thing, Rotom. I forgot something, Forry is usually the mon that goes to sleep against Brelooms (god I hate them) because it cant hurt them much and I consider this to be part of his job.</p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 132 SpD / 128 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Lava Plume<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk<br />
- Roar</p>

<p>Look, whenever you ask me what is my favorite Heatran set or what is the best Heatran set in my opinion, you will know the answer, that one above is THE Heatran set. How it is so uncommon is beyond me, but man this thing is one of those pokemons you would call “anti metagame”. Steel typing is amazing, but couple it with fire and you got a big Celebi, Shaymin, Scizor, Zapdos, Rotom, Blissey, and more, counter. This guy used to have Toxic back in the day because things like Vaporeon, Suicune, Flygon, Gyarados, and Swampert loved to switch in, but with the removal of Latias, I decided to change it with Roar, which makes this Heatran my main defense against things like Calm Mind Jirachi (one of the things Latias covered) and also an amazing shuffler. Things usually go like this, I bring in Heatran on whatever, they switch expecting a fire move, and they just get roared eating layer damage and staying on a tough position too, which makes a lot of mindgames begin, and of those mindgames none are risky for me. 
The EV spread with Calm nature gives me enough bulk to the extent of not being 2HKOd by things like a Suicune Surf, which is really appreciated if Vaporeon goes down. Also it isnt 3HKOd by Rotom and Zapdos Thunderbolt, so you can imagine how much bulk this friend has. The speed is enough to beat 0 Speed Suicune, most Taunt Skarmories, Roar Gyarados,Modest Empoleon and Magnezone with max speed and Adamant Tyranitar. The moveset is also self explanatory. Picked Lava Plume over Flamethrower because a 50%~ chance of burning after 2 moves is awesome, plus now I can abuse the burn since I lack Toxic. It also helps as a pseudo counter to Gyarados, Tyranitar, and Kingdra who switch in thinking they are completely safe. Roar I already explained, phazing and Layer purposes, and Sleep Talk makes this thing durable enough to last a whole game even if it appears on the first 3 turns. Togekiss used to have this spot in order to beat Mixmence, Latias and be the status helper, but SpDef Tran took those way better, added key resistances, played much more easily and also became the status absorber.</p>

<p><strong>Flygon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Outrage</p>

<p>When making this team I definitely needed a Scarfed Revenge Killer, as do most teams. You may think this Flygon is just a Revenger, but in reality, I like to call it the team’s sweeper. Youd be very fucking surprised at how this Flygon literally sweeps late game. Mence and Latias going out hurt this team in the sense it made Infernape & Breloom more common, which are troublesome mons, but they also did a blessing for the team, their removal caused a drastic change in how teams are built. Its going to be weird you see a time with more than 2 steels, and commonly one of those is a Lead. From my experience using this team, Steels come out very very early on the game, trying to stop Rotom or Jirachi, maybe sometimes Forretress in the case of Magnezone. The deal with this is that if I have Layers up, which is almost always, the only thing I have to do is play with 5 mons all the game tanking hits, and bringing Flygon sometimes to U-Turn out inflicting more Layers damage. By the end, Flygon shall easily sweep with Outrage because his counters are damaged/dead, and this strategy has won me a lot of games that looked lost. You could say Flygon is the player of the team that loves Layers the most. Also Earthquake is amazing with no Latias / Mence, since I can actually spam it a bit without the fear of DD Mence setting up on my face or CM Latias doing the same! Fire Blast is for Skarmory and Forry mainly, Skarm is 2HKOd after SR which helps a lot in key situations, and Forry is OHKOd which is amazing when you pull it off. U-Turn is an obvious move. I have considered Thunderpunch or Stone Edge on Flygon, but hitting Skarm badly is helpful in many scenarios that I just cannot pass that. Flygon is my main answer to eveything with “Dragon Dance” in its name, as well as things like Infernape which need to be EQd to kill them, Agility Metagross and Empoleon, and is a valuable team player due to its ability to get in on stuff like Earth Power from Shaymin and Celebi. All around, its usually the man who cleans the opponent’s team.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-W</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Trick<br />
- Hydro Pump</p>

<p>I bet when you read the Team Building Process of this team, when I mentioned Rotom, you were all “blech that damp Rest Talk Rotom again... so unoriginal...”. Well let me tell you something, this set is the best Rotom set ive ever used in my POKECAREER. Again, remember when I mentioned a team of choice in the Manaphy metagame? Thats where Rotom comes from. I needed a spin blocker, and Gengar was too damn weak, so using Rotom seemed cool. Then I decided to slap specs just because I felt like it, and man, this thing is a beast with layers. Not only it stops spin like a pro (and does it even better due to Wish support from Vap), but it hits like a god damn truck. Hydro Pump OHKOs Heatran, Gliscor, Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and all the bunch, and it also OHKOs standard Scarf Tyranitar with Spikes and SR up, yeah, its that strong. Thunderbolt doesnt get behind, it 2HKOs even the bulkiest Jirachi, Scarf Tyranitar, every Forretress and Heatran (up to 75% damage offensive ones), it does around 80% to standard Band Scizor, and it even 2HKOs Scarf Rotoms! Oh but the best part isnt all that, but Thunderbolt has an inmense chance of OHKOing a Lucario after Stealth Rock, so this thing also acts as a Lucario counter, it also 2HKOs a Suicune that has +1, in case Vaporeon fails somehow. Also everything with similar bulk to Lucario or less will be OHKOd by Thunderbolt even if its Neutral. Shadow Ball is used for things like Shaymin, as even Max HP Shaymin is 2HKOd after Stealth Rock; Celebi is a OHKO, it OHKOs even the bulkiest Rotom, hits grounds when I dont feel like risking Hydro Pump, and the likes. Trick is for Blissey and Snorlax, although I barely use it, between Roars from Heatran on Blissey/Lax and layer damage, Rotom can usually KO them when they try to get in on them. Trick also works as an “oh shit” button in case a last mon set upper tries to beat me. Although I already said Flygon acts as a cleaner, this thing is huge part of Flygon working. Due to being able to hurt everything that switches in, Flygon will have a much easier time. Also if Flygon is the cleaner, this thing is the Sweeper really, since its the mon that takes advantage of Layers the most.
Also since im a big bitch if this set suddenly gets any rise of use its because of me ok!?!?!?! Nah, im just kidding. </p>

<p><strong>Vaporeon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Water Absorb<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 168 Def / 68 SpD / 24 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Wish<br />
- Protect<br />
- Surf<br />
- Roar</p>

<p>Aaahh good ol’ reliable Vappy. Actually not so old, the first time ever I used a Vaporeon on a team was on the Latias version of this one, so im kind of a newb with it! Vaporeon was picked as the team’s bulky water for a good amount of reasons, first, it has recovery, something that was a must. Second, it can pass around the Wishes healing the team. Third, it has a phazing move. Fourth, Vaporeon is cute. When I first made the team Vaporeon, like Heatran, had Toxic, not Roar. With the byebye of Latias, I was left without a Suicune counter, specially Rest ones, therefore I had to remove Toxic and add Roar, and I do not regret it, this thing spreads passive damage around like noone!
Vaporeon is my main counter to other Waters, being able to tank Suicune, Swampert, other Vaporeons, and even Gyarados. Its also a reliable check to Kingdra, specially if I havent showed Roar, since the sub just to take a lot of damage. Also, even though its not really a counter, Vaporeon really helps me against something that would otherwise fuck me over badly, Life Orb Gengar. Those Gengars can prove annoying if they have both Focus Blast and HP Fire, but Vaporeon is only 3HKOd by Shadow Ball, making it a reliable switch. Same applies for Heatrans, since they can really hurt everything in my team, except mighty Vaporeon, who comes in and threatens to KO with Surf, just to phaze them away and spread passive damage. All in all, Vaporeon is an awesome mon in this team.</p>

<p><strong>Jirachi</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Serene Grace<br />
EVs: 44 HP / 212 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Iron Head<br />
- Fire Punch<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Substitute</p>

<p>Last but not least, the annoyer of the team and also an all around great pokemon. Jirachi used to be a Scarfer, but with the addition of Flygon to the team his revenge killing services were no longer required. Still, Jirachi adds yet another dragon resistance to the team, and is one of my main answers for full stall, since everything that enjoys Iron Head completely hates Toxic, and vice versa. The last spot was the hardest one for me to pick, since I needed a pokemon that could not only take hits, but also support the team against stall and be an “oh shit” pokemon in case I needed to take down something like a Breloom. When picking this spot I was completely blocked, therefore I asked for help to user panamaxis, whom I greatly thank for helping me create this set, since without him I doubt id have gotten to this. Jirachi is a double bleessing as well, sometimes it will sweep a whole team on its own by using Layers + Toxic + Iron head, eliminating steels with Fire Punch, and sometimes it wont do anything other than Toxicing a Swampert or Iron Heading something to kill it, but his pros outstand his cons. The way Jirachi played is quite easy, you just switch-in, hopefully when theres no Layers on my side, and on something that dies to Iron Head or Fire Punch. When you kill it, the first thing that will come to the opponent’s mind is “Scarf Jirachi” going to something like Swampert to get SR or a set up pokemon like Lucario. Thats when the surprise factor shines, hitting the switch in with something they will hate. Oh and Jirachi is also my main thing to defeat Machamp, since I only need 1 Iron Head flinch in order to put it into Thunderbolt KO range from Rotom. Btw you can call me crazy for using 3 Steels, but seriously guys, even though Mence and Latias left, theres a lot of stuff that spam Outrage, so you gotta be careful or you will be swept by last pokemon Outrage Flygon or something! The 44 HP supposedly help it survive a Max Attack Breloom Focus Punch after SR and Spikes, and also helps with overall bulk I guess. This thing also plays at everytime of the match, except very early (unless im facing a lead Machamp or trying to get a free sub on Dual Screen Azelf lead), as it excels in playing Late Game to bluff the Scarf or mid game to spread the Poison Status.</p>
