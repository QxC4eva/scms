<p><a href="http://www.shoddybattle.com/">Shoddy Battle</a> was the most popular Pok&eacute;mon simulator of the <a href="/dp/">Diamond/Pearl</a> generation. Smogon hosted a Shoddy Battle server as a service to the competitive community. Since then, it has been replaced by <a href="http://trac.poke-lab.com/">Pok&eacute;mon Laboratory</a>.</p>
