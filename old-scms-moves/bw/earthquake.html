<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and power doubles against Pokemon using Dig.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Earthquake is perhaps one of the best offensive moves around, as it has high Base Power, perfect accuracy, and no harmful side-effects. Furthermore, it hits many things hard: only Bug- and Grass-types resist it, and only Flying-types are immune. It complements Dragon-type moves, hitting Steel-types that solely resist the type super effectively. When paired with Stone Edge, it forms the EdgeQuake combo, which attains superb neutral coverage as well. It is not surprising that many Pokemon make use of this move in their arsenal, and most Ground-types that get it have high attack to back it. Not many Pokemon want to face a STAB Earthquake, and it is unwise to leave one's team susceptible to Ground-type moves. This move alone is probably the reason for the widespread use of Air Balloon, which gives a safety net against Earthquake's power, provides a free switch in, and possibly allows a Pokemon to set up while the ground shakes beneath them.</p>
