<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Provided the move hits, the user must recharge the following turn, and may not attack or switch.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>"Dragon-type Hyper Beam" is just about all that needs to be said. There are plenty of other great Dragon-type moves out there, such as Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse. Stick to one of them and leave this unimpressive signature move behind; your Dialga will thank you.</p>
