<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, or Speed (selected randomly with uniform probability) two stages when HP falls to 25% or less. Wil not raise a stat that is already +6. One-time use.</p>

<p>Provides a one-time 80 Base Power Psychic-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Starf Berry is yet another item considered too gimmicky for competitive use, mostly due to the fact it randomly chooses the stat it will raise, making it very unreliable. While it may end up raising a useful stat, it may also raise a useless one. Since the holder's HP must be very low for it to activate, it is very difficult to use it again with Recycle. Since other pinch Berries, such as Salac Berry, are more reliable, Starf Berry is often left aside.</p>
