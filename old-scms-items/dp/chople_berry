<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Fighting-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed during the damage calculation. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Fighting-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The uses for the Chople Berry are few and far between. While it could prove useful in rare cases, it can usually be forgone for better items. Dragon Dance Tyranitar takes <em>heavy</em> (95% max) damage from Infernape's Mach Punch. If you find your Tyranitar being stopped by Mach Punch Infernape consistently, Chople Berry might prove useful as it reduces the damage to 47% max. Chople Berry is also sometimes on lead Empoleon to survive Infernape's Close Combat. Empoleon can then 2HKO with a combination of Hydro Pump (activating Focus Sash) and Aqua Jet.</p>
