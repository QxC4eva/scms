Overview
########
- With most Pokemon, you ask the question "What can it do?" With Mew, you have to ask the question, "What can't it do?"
- Learns every TM and Tutor move since Gen 3, meaning it has no shortage of options.
- The Defog buff was very kind to it, as Mew is one of the few Defoggers that is not weak to Stealth Rock, and the only Defogger with Will-O-Wisp to threaten Bisharp.
- Can Baton Pass, support, lead, take hits, or even attempt to sweep.
- None of its stats, however, are actually "good" in OU terms.
- Offenses can't exactly sweep, while Speed leaves it often outsped.
- It still has reliable recovery, and can do almost anything you want it to.

Hazard Control
########
name: Hazard Control
move 1: Defog
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Soft-Boiled
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Taunt
ability: Synchronize
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 148 Def / 108 Spe
ivs: 0 Atk
nature: Bold

Moves
========
- Defog got buffed this generation. It now gets rid of hazards on both sides, making Mew a very good candidate for clearing hazards.
- Taunt allows Mew to shut down hazard setters such as Forretress, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn even harder.
- Stealth Rock is used to lay down your own hazards after you get rid of your opponent's.
Soft-Boiled provides reliable recovery and allows Mew to switch in and Defog over and over.
- Will-O-Wisp discourages Bisharp from trying to get a free +2 Attack off Defog, and can also cripple physical attackers such as Cloyster and Breloom.
- U-Turn allows Mew to scout and gain momentum after clearing hazards.
- Baton Pass and Volt switch are options over U-Turn, but U-Turn cannot be Taunted and has no immunities.
- Reflect Type, while gimmicky, allows Mew to switch out of Tyranitar and Scizor without fearing Pursuit.
- Mew can also opt to run another status move, such as Thunder Wave or Toxic, but Will-O-Wisp is recommended to avoid being Bisharp bait.
- Tailwind can offer further support to Mew's team.
- An attacking move, such as Fire Blast or Ice Beam, may also be used so Mew can do damage.

Set Details
========
- The given EVs outspeed +Speed Base 70s, such as Bisharp, Breloom, and Cloyster, while keeping Mew's physical bulk high.
- 0 Attack IV is recommended to minimize confusion and Foul Play damage.
- If running an attacking move, Special Attack EVs may be run to grab certain OHKOes.
A slightly faster 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 Spe Timid spread may be used to get the jump on Jolly Gyarados.
- A 252 HP / 108 Def / 148 Spe Bold spread is a compromise between the two, outspeeding Smeargle to Taunt it, although situational.

Usage Tips
========
- Mew is a bulky Defogger. It can switch in on many defensive Pokemon, such as Forretress, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Blissey, and Chansey, Taunt them, and Defog.
- Defog is best used without hazards of your own, except for Mew's own Stealth Rock.
- Mew can also support the team by crippling physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp.
- If running Stealth Rock, Mew can immediately set up hazards after clearing the field with Defog.
- If running U-Turn, Mew takes the role of a bulky Defogging pivot.

Team Options
========
- Defog support is nice for Pokemon weak to hazards, such as Volcarona, Talonflame, and Dragonite.
- Mew appreciates teammates that can deal with Tyranitar, Scizor, and Bisharp.
- If Mew runs Stealth Rock, it can support sweepers such as Mega Lucario and Aegislash.
- If Mew runs U-Turn, it can either provide a slow U-Turn or a fast U-Turn, depending on the opponent. Slow U-Turns are useful to bring in frail sweepers such as Talonflame.

Stallbreaker
########
name: Stallbreaker
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Soft-Boiled
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Psychic / Ice Beam
ability: Synchronize
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 148 Def / 108 Spe
ivs: 0 Atk
nature: Bold

Moves
========
- The main focus of this set is Taunt.
- Taunt, in addition to Will-O-Wisp, allows Mew to dismantle many stall cores.
- Soft-Boiled gives Mew much-needed longevity.
- Psychic gives Mew a STAB attacking move, so that it can damage a burned or Taunted Pokemon.
- Ice Beam is another option to take down Pokemon such as Dragonite, Garchomp, and Salamence more quickly.
- Another attacking move, such as Fire Blast or Aura Sphere, may be used instead.
- A supporting move, such as Defog, Knock Off, or Heal Bell, may be used instead of an attacking move, but Mew needs to be able to deal damage in order to break stall.

Set Details
========
- The given EVs outspeed +Speed Base 70s, such as Bisharp, Breloom, and Cloyster, while maximizing Mew's physical bulk.
- 0 Attack IV is recommended to minimize confusion and Foul Play damage.
- A slightly faster 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 Spe Timid spread may be used to get the jump on Jolly Gyarados.
- Some Special Attack EVs may be invested to deal more damage with Psychic or Ice Beam.

Usage Tips
========
- This set singlehandedly dismantles many stall cores, such as the infamous SkarmBliss.
- Use this set to threaten defensive opponents and to give your teammates an edge.
- Mew can also cripple opposing Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Dragonite, with Will-O-Wisp.

Team Options
========
- Mew can potentially allow a sweeper, such as Mega Lucario, to switch in and boost easily.
- Mew can also provide burn support easily.
- As a result, teammates that benefit from Mew are frail sweepers, and physically frail Pokemon.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Psyshock / Psychic
move 3: Aura Sphere
move 4: Shadow Ball / Fire Blast
ability: Synchronize
item: Leftovers / Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
ivs: 0 Atk
nature: Timid

Moves
========
- Nasty Plot instantly boosts Mew's Special Attack stat to 598, and in addition to its good bulk and decent Speed, it can attempt a sweep.
- Psyshock is suggested as Psychic STAB because it hits special walls such as Blissey and Sylveon harder. Psychic has more power, but with it, Mew is more prone to being walled by special sponges.
- Aura Sphere gets good coverage with Psychic, and has perfect accuracy to boot.
- Fire Blast gets coverage on certain Steel-types, such as Klefki and Scizor, while hitting Psychic- and Fairy-types decently well, while Shadow Ball gets coverage on Psychic-types, such as Reuniclus.
- Unlike past generations, there are now a couple Pokemon that can counter this set regardless of its coverage move, and Fairies in general nerfed its coverage moves. As such, Baton Pass is an option in the last slot to swap out to a teammate if one of Mew's counters switches in.
- Soft-Boiled can be used to make Mew last longer.
- Mew has literally everything for coverage.
- Thunderbolt hits bulky waters well.
- Giga Drain takes out bulky waters and lets you recover health.
- Taunt allows Mew to break down more walls, especially if it is running Psychic over Psyshock.
- Vacuum Wave can be used for priority, but it is weak.

Set Details
========
- EVs and nature maximize Speed and special attacking potential.
- Leftovers can be used to maintain some bulk, while Lum Berry lets it shrug off status.
- Life Orb is an option as a full sweeper, allowing it to nab many more KOes.
- A bulkier spread can also be used, with a Modest nature and Softboiled, to increase Mew's power and bulk at the cost of Speed.

Usage Tips
========
- Nasty Plot Mew is a very unpredictable sweeper, because it can run just about any coverage move it wants to.
- No one predicts Nasty Plot Mew. People will often assume Defog or Baton Pass, letting Mew do more work.
- If you want to attempt a sweep, make sure any powerful revenge killers, such as Garchomp and Terrakion, are out of the way.
- Mew really likes hazards support, which allows it to get more 2HKOes and OHKOes.

Team Options
========
- Hazard setters, such as Skarmory and Forretress, let Mew get more KOes.
- Baton Passing Speed boosts from Scolipede or Ninjask turns Mew into a monster, but it is not necessary.
- A Wish passer can provide Mew with enough HP to potentially set up multiple times throughout a match, letting it wallbreak early and sweep later.

Quick Baton Pass
########
name: Quick Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Rock Polish
move 3: Swords Dance / Nasty Plot
move 4: Taunt / Substitute
ability: Synchronize
item: Mental Herb / Lum Berry
evs: 252 HP / 148 Def / 108 Spe
ivs: 0 Atk
nature: Bold

Moves
========
- Baton Pass is a wonderful move, especially on Mew.
- Rock Polish is Mew's only way to boost Speed and is thus mandatory to support whatever sweeper it needs to.
- Swords Dance or Nasty Plot is your offensive boosting move, depending on the sweeper you are passing to.
- Taunt is very useful, especially with Mental Herb, to make sure opposing Taunt's don't stop you completely. It also stops status and phazing.
- Substitute can be used to protect Mew from status and give it something else to pass. Mew also is able to make 101 HP Substitutes, which means Chansey and Blissey won't break your Subs.
- Amnesia, Iron Defense, Calm Mind, and Bulk can also go in the third slot, but are better suited to full Baton Pass teams.

Set Details
========
- The given EVs allow Mew to outspeed all relevant Scarfers (Scarf Gengar/Latios and down) after one Rock Polish. The rest of the EVs are placed in HP and Defense to provide physical bulk, letting it set up on Scizor and Tyranitar if Reflect is up.
- Moving all Defense EVs into Special Defense and using a Calm nature is a viable option too, as is splitting EVs between defenses.
- Mental Herb protects Mew against Taunt once, and is especially helpful if Mew itself is running Taunt.
- Lum Berry can protect Mew against status, such as paralysis and sleep, once.
- 0 Attack EVs minimize Foul Play and confusion damage.

Usage Tips
========
- This set is for quick passing.
- Mew takes three turns to set up and Baton Pass, so having Dual Screens up is very helpful for it. Klefki especially is a great partner for Dual Screens.
Physical sweepers such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Pinsir can become pretty much unstoppable with +2/+2 Baton Passed to it.
- Special sweepers such as Hydreigon, Latios, and Landorus-I can be equally unstoppable with +2/+2 (just watch out for Blissey and Chansey).
- Infiltrator Pokemon and hard-hitting Pokemon such as Choice Band Tyranitar and Bisharp can 2HKO Mew through Screens, so beware.

Team Options
========
- The aforementioned Infiltrators and hard-hitters should be covered by teammates.
- Dual Screen Klefki is pretty much a must in order to run this set.
- Be absolutely sure your sweeper can actually sweep with its boosts. If you are Baton Passing Nasty Plot, watch for Chansey and Blissey, and so on.

Full Baton Pass
########
name: Full Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Amnesia / Iron Defense
move 4: Ice Beam / Dazzling Gleam / Roar
ability: Synchronize
item: Mental Herb
evs: 252 HP / 148 Def / 108 Spe
ivs: 0 Atk
nature: Bold

Moves
========
- Baton Pass, along with its wide movepool, means Mew can fit well on any full Baton Pass chain.
- Mew's 101 HP Substitutes are invaluable for any Baton Pass team, since Seismic Toss cannot break them.
- Depending on what your team's needs, Mew can provide either Iron Defense or Amnesia.
- Taunt stops the chain from being Taunted, and provides another buffer against status and phazing.
- If your chain already has a few Special Attack boosts, Mew can use Dazzling Gleam to destroy Sableye, or Ice Beam to kill Tornadus-I and Thundurus-I, the biggest threats to any Baton Pass team.
- Roar can be used instead of an attacking move to phaze stat boosters.
- Calm Mind or Bulk Up can be used over Amnesia or Iron Defense, respectively, but they are slower in boosting and most Baton Pass teams have those boosts covered by default anyways.

Set Details
========
- The given EVs, again, allows Mew to outspeed all relevant Pokemon in OU with two Speed boosts, which a Ninjask can easily provide.
- Soft-Boiled can be used on the set somewhere to provide reliable recovery for itself, but almost every Baton Pass team has a Wish user (usually Vaporeon).
- Mental Herb gives Mew a one-time protection against Taunt, which is really valuable against Pranksters.
- Leftovers can provide passive recovery if needed, but Mew should be supplied with Ingrain, which, along with defensive boosts, heals enough for Mew.

Usage Tips
========
- Mew is probably one of the best candidates for a full Baton Pass chain, and the only reason you would ever pass it up is because you don't want to run Espeon and Mew on the same team.
- Mew should be used to pass 101 HP Substitutes, and to pass a defensive boost.
- Mew is also a good Prankster lure for Baton Pass teams, with either Ice Beam or Dazzling Gleam.

Team Options
========
- Smeargle should be considered for any full Baton Pass team, providing Ingrain and Spore (but mostly Ingrain).
- A Speed Boost Pokemon, such as Scolipede, is used to begin the chain.
- Vaporeon is an amazing partner for Mew on a Baton Pass team, because it can supply Aqua Ring and Wish.
Espeon and Mr. Mime are pretty mandatory too, because of Magic Bounce and Soundproof, respectively.

Other Options
########
Pretty much everything. In particular:
- Lead
- Swords Dance
- SubPunch
- Phazing
- Transform
- Choice sets

Checks & Counters
########
- There is no true counter to Mew due to its versatility.
- Heatran can sponge anything defensive and support sets can throw at it.
Prankster Taunters, such as Sableye, Thundurus-I, and Tornadus-I, can stop the support sets.
- Offensive Tyranitar can Pursuit trap Mew or threaten with a Crunch, but it can be burned by Will-O-Wisp or OHKOed by a +2 Aura Sphere.
- Calm Mind Latios and Latias can set up on defensive and support sets, but must be wary of Ice Beam.
- Bulky Psychic-types, such as Assault Vest Reuniclus or Slowbro, can beat the Nasty Plot set if it lacks Dark Pulse.
- Some bulky Steel-types, such as Klefki and Mega Scizor, can beat the Nasty Plot set if it lacks Fire Blast.
- Bulky Fairy-types, such as Togekiss, when invested in Defense, can beat the Nasty Plot set regardless of its coverage move.
- Against Baton Pass, if it is being covered by Dual Screens, get rid of the Dual Screens with Defog, or smack the Dual Screener (often Klefki) very hard.
- Phazing moves will stop the Baton Pass set, but Taunt prevents Roar and Whirlwind while Substitute protects against Dragon Tail.
- If Mew is on a full Baton Pass team, try to kill the chain ASAP. If Mew comes out with Speed boosts, a Substitute, Ingrain, and Defense boosts, it's pretty much over.
- Mew is not exactly fast. Choice Scarfers and faster Pokemon can outspeed it and dent it.
