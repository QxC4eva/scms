<p>Well, once again, Smogonites and Smogonettes, the year wears on. With the recent World Championships for the Pok&eacute;mon VGC and TCG, as well as more rounds of Smogon's suspect testing, the Generation V metagame looks to be stabilizing nicely. But we don't care about that, do we? ...Oh, you do. Uh, okay. Well...</p>

<p>Aside from the congratulations and well-wishes of those who have won or done well at San Diego, commiserations go to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=52547">srk1214</a>. While it isn't a nice shiny trophy and several thousand dollars prize money, it is a fancy custom title, courtesy of mingot! 9/10 is a respectable score, and a surprising amount of detail was given. That's what I like to see! Please get in contact with an admin for your prize.</p>
 
<p>Oh, I guess you guys all want to know the answers? Right then, here goes.</p>

<p><strong>1. In Mossdeep City, if you leave the Pok&eacute;Center, walk to the southeastern-most point of the island, what do you find?</strong><br />
Indeed, the answer was a <strong>Net Ball</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>2. In Iron Island, if you go down the left flight of stairs in the cave, how many barrels are in that room?</strong><br />
I think many people were confused about what I mean by left. I did mean our left, that's the room which is a dead-end. There are only <strong>four</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>3. How many sets of stairs are there in Route 3 in Kanto? How many of those are necessary for traversing the Route?</strong><br />
Aside from the games where there aren't any staircases, there have always been <strong>six</strong>. Of which, <strong>five</strong> are necessary.</p>

<p><strong>4. In HeartGold/SoulSilver, if I play the lottery in Goldenrod on a Sunday and get first prize, what would I win?</strong><br />
When I say "first prize" I meant the first one in line, the lowest rank. Not the first place. The answer is <strong>TM02 Dragon Claw</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>5. What is unusual about cycling down Driftveil Drawbridge?</strong><br />
This was pretty easy. <strong>No bike music plays</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>6. In Celadon Department store in Generation I, if I were to purchase one of everything on the 4th floor, how much would I spend?</strong><br />
<strong>9400 Pok√© Dollars</strong>. 1 Pok&eacute;Doll and 4 Evolution Stones.</p>

<p><strong>7. In Crater Forest of Black and White, 8 items are on the floor. Name 5 of them.</strong><br />
The eight you could have chosen from are: <strong>Max Elixir, Max Potion, Revive, Max Revive, Full Heal, Carbos, TM03 Psyshock, and TM13 Ice Beam</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>8. In Crystal, if I am at the top terminus of Ilex Forest, by walking south 1 pace, east 10 paces, north 3 paces, east 3 paces, then north 3 paces, will I be facing a headbutt-compatible tree?</strong><br />
It's worth mentioning here that by tapping the D-Pad, you turn in a direction but don't actually walk. This isn't a pace. This is what may have lead to confusion. If you follow the directions properly, then <strong>yes, you should be facing a headbutt-compatible tree</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>9. Noland aside, which of the Battle Frontier Brains in Emerald do not use a Legendary Pokemon?</strong><br />
By this, I meant for both their Silver and Gold Symbol challenges. There are only two that fulfill this criteria: <strong>Lucy and Greta</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>10. At the Canyon Entrance in FireRed/LeafGreen, what is the theoretical least number of grass patches the player must walk through to get to the other side of the area?</strong><br />
<strong>23</strong>. Pretty simple, actually.</p>

<p>So. Without further ado, here are the questions for this issue.</p>

<ol>
<li>Which two Pokemon are featured on the upcoming third Black and White TCG Expansion set?</li>
<li>How many anime appearances does Galvantula have?</li>
<li>Name all of the Electric-type Pokemon (dual-type or otherwise) that cannot evolve.</li>
<li>Which one of the following three Pokemon have not had a featured event: Charmander, Zoroark, Dodrio?</li>
<li>Of all the Pokemon which can have the ability Heavy Metal, which stat on average is the lowest between them?</li>
<li>What recoil-inducing move has the widest distribution?</li>
<li>What team in standard Smogon OU would have the highest combined BST?</li>
<li>Name at least three Pokemon that have the same name in English as they do in phonetic Japanese.</li>
<li>Discounting Mew, Smeargle, and the Mimic Glitch, what Pokemon has the widest natural movepool?</li>
<li>Which six Pokemon from Generation V are at the top of the tables for each stat (By this I mean what has the highest base HP in Gen V, highest base Atk, and so on)?</li>
</ol>

<p>As always, answers go to <a href="http://smogon.com/forums/member.php?u=32443">The Smog</a>, titled "Issue (X) Polls/Trivia". Good luck!</p>
