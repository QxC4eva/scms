<h3>The Defensive Core</h3>
 
 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/442.png" alt="Bronzong" />
 
<pre>Bronzong @ Occa Berry 
Ability: Levitate
EVs: 252 HP/152 Atk/104 Sdef 
Relaxed nature (+Def, -Spd)
- Stealth Rock
- Trick Room
- Gyro Ball
- Explosion</pre></div>
 
<p>Bronzong is my first Trick Room user. It is a nice lead for this team, being able to set-up Stealth Rocks and Trick Room in the beginning of the game and unlike most Uber leads, Bronzong can make use of Trick Room. I usually avoid to explode it in the beginning of the match . With rain support from Kyogre, Bronzong has no weakness and 7 resistances, allowing it to switch into many ubers and set-up Trick Room a lot of times before exploding. Occa Berry is here to prevent leads like Groudon OKHOing Bronzong with Overheat or Deoxis-A 2HKOing with Fire Punch. Also, if I keep Occa Berry, Bronzong can make a nice check against Rayquaza, surviving an Overheat and hitting back with Gyro Ball or just exploding on it depending of how much HP Bronzong has left.</p>
 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/488.png" alt="Dialga" />
<pre>Dialga @ Shuca Berry
Ability: Pressure
EVs: 252 HP/252 SAtk/4 SDef
Quiet nature (+SAtk, -Spd)
- Trick Room
- Thunder
- Draco Meteor
- Flamethrower</pre></div>
 
<p>The second Pokemon of my defensive core, Dialga packs a lot of resistances making a reliable Trick Room user. It makes a defensive pair with Cresselia, resisting to all Cresselia's weakness while Cresselia resists to Dialga's two only weakness. Unlike the rest of my defensive core Dialga has a lot of power and can even work as a late game sweeper under Trick Room. Shuca Berry allows Dialga to survive Earthquakes from Rayquaza and Groudon, set-up Trick Room and KO them with Draco Meteor.</p>
 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/493.png" alt="Cresselia" />
<pre>Cresselia (F) @ Leftovers
Ability: Levitate
EVs: 252 HP/252 Def/4 SAtk
Bold nature (+Def, -Atk)
- Trick Room
- Ice Beam
- Moonlight
- Lunar Dance</pre></div>
 
<p>Cressilia fills a lot of defensive holes in my team, she is an excellent Groudon, Garchomp and Rayquaza counter and resists to Dialga's two weakness, making a good defensive pair with it. Ice Beam is only for Rayquaza, Groudon, Shaymin-s and Garchomp as Cresselia lacks of offensive power to hurt everything else. Lunar Dance can bring some weakned sweeper back too the game, mainly Kyogre who usually will be at low health after using substitute few times. Moonlight isn't the most reliable healing move but it can be useful if my opponent has Groudon on his team.</p>
 
<h3>The Offensive Core</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/489.png" alt="Palkia" />
<pre>Palkia @ Choice Scarf
Ability: Pressure
EVs: 4 Atk/252 SAtk/252 Spd 
Mild nature (+SAtk, -Def)
- Spacial Rend
- Surf
- Thunder
- Outrage</pre></div>
 
<p>Scarf Palkia is for situations when Trick Room wore off and I need a revenge killer. It can revenge kill or force switches allowing me to switch back to a Trick Room user. Palika is quite useful agaisnt SD Rayquaza locked on Outrage revenge killing it with Spacial Rend. Surf gains a lot of power under the rain, KOing a lot of things. Thunder is for Kyogre. With Outrage I can 2HKO Blissey and have a reliable way to revenge kill Lati@s.</p>
 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/382.png" alt="Kyogre" />
<pre>Kyogre @ Life Orb
Ability: Drizzle
EVs: 252 HP/4 Def/252 SAtk
Quiet nature (+SAtk, -Spd)
- Surf
- Thunder
- Ice Beam
- Waterfall</pre></div>
 
<p>With Palkia using Choice Scarf I took Choice Specs from Kyogre. Also, using the Calm Mind set consumes me precious turns of Trick Room, Life Orb Kyogre provides me a powerful sweeper when Trick Room is active. Surf 2HKO everything that doesn't resist to it or Blissey. Thunder provides me a powerful attack against my opponent's Kyogre and is the best way to hurt Palkia. Ice Beam hits a lot of things for super-effective damage like Rayquaza, Lati@s ( doing aroung 50% on Latias), Giratina and Shaymin. Waterfall is for Blissey 2HKOing her. Most of time Blissey will switch in Kyogre taking surf, Waterfall can OHKO after Stealth Rocks damage and some damage from Surf.</p>
 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/download/sprites/dp/214.png" alt="Heracross" />
<pre>Heracross (M) @ Leftovers
Ability: Guts
EVs: 252 HP/252 Atk/4 SDef
Brave nature (+Atk, -Spd)
- Close Combat
- Megahorn
- Sleep Talk
- Rest</pre></div>
 
<p>Heracross is my status absorber. It's an excellent Darkrai counter, absorbing sleep and resisting to Dark Pulse and Focus Blast. He is a nice switch-in for Blissey. Close Combat and Megahorn are a nice attack combination in ubers. Sleep Talk is for Darkrai and Rest provides a healing move at the same time I activate Guts. Heracross is quite bulky and can take some hits from ubers like Mewtwo and Latias without Psychic and hitting back with Megahorn. Also, Heracross does an excellent job when facing Lugia. If Lugia tries to Roost, Megahorn will deal super-effective damage (about 90%), it it use Toxic Heracross gains Guts boost, so usually I can wear down Lugia unless it Whirlwind Heracross always. Also, due his bulkiness, Heracross can take some hits from Lugia even after some Calm Minds.</p>

<p>What a like about Heracross as a Darkrai counter is that, unlike Primape, Heracross is not a dead weight when Darkrai is gone. With Trick Room and Guts activated Heracross can be a powerful sweeper, reaching 574 Atk. With two 120 BP STAB attacks, few things can take hits from Heracross in the uber metagame. The only things that can take Heracross attacks with Guts boost are Giratina, Giratina-o, Ho-oh and Rayquaza. In some games where I lost all my ubers, I could won with a Heracross sweep.</p></div>
 
<p>Ubers is commonly seen as by far the most centralised metagame, dominated by offensive teams that feature the same few Pokemon. With this team, Pirika demonstrates how it’s possible to create an innovative, yet effective team with a little bit of thinking outside of the box.</p>
 
<p>This team is based around the strategy of setting up Trick Room with his core of support Pokemon, enabling the offensive members of his team to sweep. Between Bronzong, Dialga, and Cresselia, Pirika has a solid defensive core of Trick Room users, which allows him to play around threats reasonably well, which provides the free turns that are necessary for setting up Trick Room.</p>
 
<p>By leading with Bronzong, Pirika is able to quickly get down Stealth Rock and Trick Room, as well as having a solid lead that can stand up to most of the common leads reasonably well. Bronzong also provides a safe switch into the powerful Dragon-type attacks that are abundant in Ubers; it is then able to either set up Trick Room, or simply explode on dangerous threats upon coming in.</p>
 
<p>Dialga and Cresselia are Pirika’s other Trick Room users along with Bronzong, and they work together extremely well, resisting all of each other’s weaknesses. Dialga brings a lot of versatility to the team, as it is able to switch into many of the attacks that give this team problems, due to its great resistances. This gives it plenty of opportunities to set up Trick Room, as well as opportunities to weaken or sweep teams with its huge Special Attack stat. Combined with Dialga, Cresselia provides a check to many of the big problems that this team faces, such as Groudon and Rayquaza, as well as giving Pirika his third and final Trick Room user. By using Lunar Dance, Pirika is able to fully heal one of his sweepers later on in the game, which gives him a lot more freedom to use them early on in order to weaken teams.</p>
 
<p>Kyogre is the teams main sweeper, as very little can switch into a Life Orb Kyogre once Trick Room is up, and is generally used as the teams main way of wall-breaking and weakening teams. Blissey will often come into Kyogre, only for it to be 2HKOed by Life Orb boosted Waterfall, potentially opening up a sweep for either Kyogre or Dialga. Kyogre is usually the teams main Lunar Dance recipient, as very few teams can handle a Life Orb Kyogre for a second time, since it’s already weakened most of its main counters earlier on in the game. Unparalleled coverage means that Kyogre is able to hit every Pokémon for at least neutral damage. Kyogre also provides the team with an always helpful secondary special backbone, thanks to it's 140 base Special Defense and 100 base HP stats.</p>
 
<p>Heracross is an excellent status absorber for Pirika's team, thanks to Guts as well as Sleep Talk (which also makes it an excellent Darkrai counter). Megahorn and Close Combat are both ridiculously overpowered STAB moves, which allow Heracross to slaughter many Pokémon while Trick Room is in effect. Megahorn is a great tool for late game sweeping under Trick Room's effect, due to the large amount of Psychic-type Pokémon who occupy Ubers. Close Combat allows Heracross to smash Dialga, Groudon, Kyogre, and others with a 100% accurate attack coming off of 383 Attack with an occasional Guts boost; it is truly a force to be reckoned with.</p>
 
<p>A pretty common problem for Trick Room teams is that they are incredibly vulnerable when Trick Room isn’t active. Choice Scarf Palkia goes a long way towards solving this problem for Pirika, giving him a solid revenge killer, as well as complementing the rest of the team nicely, since it provides a check to many Pokemon who could give him problems, such as Kyogre. Outrage allows Palkia to 2HKO Blissey, which means that his Kyogre can often sweep without even having to use Waterfall, which prevents him from sacrificing the element of surprise. However, Palkia is one of Pirika's only answers to Swords Dance Rayquaza outside of Trick Room, and a very shaky one at that; it often gets OHKOed by a Swords Danced ExtremeSpeed, even without Stealth Rock on the field.</p>
 
<p>While this team is both well made and innovative, it’s obviously not without its problems. Stall teams can be extremely difficult for this team to break, as it’s heavily reliant on Kyogre to beat them, and mixed Palkia can do a lot of damage to pretty much anything on the team. Palkia has an incredibly easy time coming in as well, easily coming into Kyogre's Waterfalls or Surfs when Trick Room is not active and forcing it out with the threat of Thunder or one of its strong Dragon-type moves. Forretress can come in any time it wants, if Cresselia or Bronzong is out, and lay entry hazards without remorse, making it much harder for Pirika to maneuver in general. Toxic Spikes is also a huge problem for Kyogre, as it means it is taking 22% damage per turn, or more if there is more than one layer down, on top of the damage that it takes when coming into Spikes and Stealth Rock, which hurts, especially as Kyogre is Pirika's only chance at breaking stall.</p>
