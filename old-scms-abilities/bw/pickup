<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If a one-time use item is consumed by any Pokemon and the wielder is holding no item, the wielder gains the used item. The most recent item consumed by the wielder cannot be Pickuped by the wielder. Items thrown with <a href="/bw/moves/fling">Fling</a> can be Pickuped. If multiple Pokemon on the field have Pickup, the fastest Pokemon will Pickup the most recently used item, the second fastest Pokemon will Pickup the second-most recently used item, etc.</p>

<p>If an item has been Pickuped by another Pokemon, it cannot be regenerated via <a href="/bw/moves/recycle">Recycle</a> or <a href="/bw/abilities/harvest">Harvest</a>. Items that have been removed via <a href="/bw/moves/bug_bite">Bug Bite</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/incinerate">Incinerate</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/knock_off">Knock Off</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/pluck">Pluck</a> cannot be Pickuped. Gems that activate on the use of <a href="/bw/moves/volt_switch">Volt Switch</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/u-turn">U-turn</a> cannot be Pickuped. <a href="/bw/items/air_balloon">Air Balloon</a> cannot be Pickuped if it is popped by an attack. Items consumed by Pokemon that have since fainted and items consumed by Pokemon that are currently not on the field cannot be Pickuped.</p> 

<p>Outside of battle, Pickup allows the wielder to receive a random free item after battling if it isn't already holding one. The item collected is based on the level of the wielder.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The ability has been improved from useless this generation. However, the ability is way too situational in singles battles, and in metagames like VGC, no Pokemon can really use Pickup well anyway. Single-use items are only common in doubles and VGC so if you do see it, there would be the primary place to find it. The only decent user of it would be <a href="/bw/pokemon/ambipom">Ambipom</a> anyway, which would always use <a href="/bw/abilities/technician">Technician</a> over Pickup. You will very seldom see Pickup used and even less of the time will it actually do something beneficial.</p>
