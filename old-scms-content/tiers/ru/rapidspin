<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Rapid Spin is one of the most useful moves in the game because it gets rid of any and all entry hazards. You can have a critical Pokemon that is weak to Stealth Rock and unleash its full potential once Stealth Rock is spun away. For example, Moltres is one of the premier special attackers in RU and its large Stealth Rock weakness keeps it in line; however, when paired with a spinner, it can easily dismantle teams with its power. This is but one example of the advantages to using Rapid Spin. Rapid Spin also keeps your team healthy. Because of the constant switching, any entry hazard damage will quickly add up, and with them gone, switching is not as costly.</p>

<p>The almost endless benefits of Rapid Spin only happen if it hits. Because Rapid Spin is a Normal-type attack, it cannot hit Ghost-type Pokemon, also known as spinblockers. The Ghost-types in the tier have the job of blocking Rapid Spin and its users so the entry hazards stay set up.</p>

<h2>Rapid Spinners</h2>

<p><strong>Kabutops</strong></p>

<p>Kabutops is the best offensive spinner in RU. A high base 115 Attack combined with a moderate base 80 Speed means that Kabutops is a real offensive threat with or without a boost. Kabutops is fortunate enough to be able to break through most spinblockers after a Swords Dance boost with Stone Edge. The bulkiest of Spiritomb is KOed with a +2 Stone Edge after Stealth Rock, and Rotom and Misdreavus are OHKOed. Rotom is the biggest threat for Kabutops due to its higher Speed and ability to still take down a Weak Armor-boosted Kabutops if holding a Choice Scarf. Two great abilities&mdash;Weak Armor and Swift Swim&mdash;adds to Kabutops's versatility. With Weak Armor, Kabutops can switch into a resisted physical attack, like Entei's Flare Blitz, and its Speed gets increased by one stage. Combine this with a Swords Dance boost and Kabutops can Rapid Spin before the opponent can attack, take down a spinblocker, and / or start a sweep. On Rain Dance teams, Swift Swim Kabutops is a great Pokemon that is extremely dangerous with or without a boost, and it can keep its team healthy by spinning away entry hazards. All in all, Kabutops works well by pummeling the opposing team with strong STAB attacks and spinning when it has a chance; it doesn't as work as well on the defensive.</p>

<p><strong>Cryogonal</strong></p>

<p>Cryogonal is an excellent bulky Rapid Spin user that is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, but sadly has a weakness to Stealth Rock. A tremendous base 135 Special Defense with a passable base 70 HP means it can take a lot of punishment on the special side, but not so much on the physical with a base 30 Defense. Cryogonal's biggest asset is Recover, which lets it continually spin and not get worn down by Stealth Rock. Cryogonal has no problem handling Rotom and Misdreavus, but has some difficulty taking down Spiritomb due to its low base Defense, which makes Sucker Punch or Pursuit leave a large dent. Cryogonal works on and against hail teams. Cryogonal blocks Ice-type attackers like Glaceon and Rotom-F, and can take advantage of hail by using perfectly accurate Blizzards. Stall teams really love having Cryogonal on the team because of its durability and ability to tank most special attackers. Cryogonal's gameplan is to continually chip away at the opponent's spinblocker and eventually use Rapid Spin when it's gone. It can also take an offensive approach like Kabutops and hit hard specially with Icicle Plate-boosted Ice Beams, and spin when it has the chance. Cryogonal is a bulkier spinner than Kabutops and will outlast most of the spinblockers with its longevity.</p>

<p><strong>Sandslash</strong></p>

<p>Sandslash is a blend of both Kabutops and Cryogonal in that it has a good base 100 Attack that is augmented by Swords Dance and a great base 110 Defense; however, Sandslash is too slow to be a great offensive threat and lacks reliable recovery to be a constant defensive threat. Sandslash can boost with Swords Dance and break through any spinblockers with a +2 Earthquake, Stone Edge, or Night Slash, and can absorb a Will-O-Wisp thanks to Lum Berry. It can 2HKO Spiritomb with a boosted Earthquake, take down Rotom with Stone Edge or Night Slash, and can only 2HKO Misdreavus if using Night Slash. On the other hand, Sandslash can also take a support role and set up Stealth Rock and slowly wear down spinblockers with Earthquake and Toxic, but will usually need the help of Pursuit users like Spiritomb or Absol. Sandslash is a mix of both ends and is in the middle in terms of offensive and defensive prowess, but with some unique additions that help to separate it from its competition.</p>

<h2>Other Options</h2>

<p><strong>Torkoal</strong></p>

<p>Torkoal can be a good Rapid Spin user, but needs more support than the ones listed above. Torkoal is best utilized with the Shell Smash set, which gives it the power to muscle through some spinblockers with Fire Blast and use Rapid Spin afterwards; however, Torkoal is too slow even after a Shell Smash boost and lacks the firepower to break through some of the bulkier spinblockers. The most effective Torkoal set is an offensive one, which takes the fight to the opponent, immediately placing offensive pressure on them.</p>

<p><strong>Armaldo</strong></p>

<p>Armaldo might look like an inferior Kabutops, and it is in many regards, but it has some perks above Kabutops. Armaldo takes full damage from all entry hazards, so isn't the most effective in getting rid of them because it's so weak to them. On the other hand, Armaldo's high base 125 Attack trumps even Kabutops, and a good base 100 Defense means that it can take non-super effective physical attacks well; however, its mediocre Special Defense, low Speed, and poor defensive typing leaves it reeling sometimes. Armaldo's best chance is utilizing a Choice Band, which can punch holes in any spinblocker with Stone Edge, leaving them second guessing if they want to switch in. Sadly, every other niche is performed better by the already noted spinners.</p>

<h2>What Not to Use</h2>

<p><strong>Hitmonchan</strong> and <strong>Hitmonlee</strong></p>

<p>While it is true that Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee can guarantee a Rapid Spin even against Ghost-types with the combination of Foresight and Rapid Spin, doing so completely wastes their potential. The process of spinning makes them useless afterwards, which means one of your teamslots is now deadweight. Other than spinning, Hitmonchan has the potential to hit offensively with coverage attacks. Hitmonlee has better sets that take advantage of its high Attack and Base Power moves, and with Rapid Spin it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome. Other spinners have a way around spinblockers without Kamikaze-ing themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Delibird</strong> and <strong>Spinda</strong></p>

<p>Just because a Pokemon gets Rapid Spin doesn't mean that they should use it. Delibird gets half its health stripped away upon switching in and has no way to get around Ghost-type Pokemon, add to the fact that Delibird has awful offenses and defenses and you have one poor Pokemon on your hands. Spinda is in a similar boat. It has no way to get around Ghost-type Pokemon and Contrary has no way of helping. If you want a spinner, use a Pokemon that can actually do something.</p>

<h2>How Offensive Teams benefit</h2>

<p>Offensive teams are characterized by hitting hard and not letting up, and using clever switching can place the opponent in a predicament. Some of RU's most powerful sweepers are hindered by Stealth Rock, not to mention any other hazards. Offensive powerhouses like Moltres and Jynx have their lifespans cut short with hazards on the field. Offensive teams commonly utilize Rapid Spin users with offensive presence, that way they don't lose momentum. Kabutops and Cryogonal are commonly chosen thanks to their utility and power behind their attacks. Offensive teams that don't have hazards on their side can freely switch their sweepers in and not worry as much about the residual damage adding up.</p>

<h2>How Defensive Teams benefit</h2>

<p>Defensive teams are often characterized by tanking the opponent's attacks with resistances and stats to render them unable to break through. Switching Pokemon in and out will lead to entry hazard damage to accumulate, which could spell a loss. Great defensive Pokemon like Steelix and Qwilfish lack reliable recovery, so damage from Spikes and Stealth Rock can quickly add up. The common Rapid Spin users on defensive teams are Cryogonal and Sandslash thanks to their Special Defense and Defense, respectively. They can slowly wear down opposing spinblockers with Toxic or with their STAB attacks. With entry hazards gone, the walls and tanks can breath a little easier, because now they only have to contend with attacks.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Rapid Spin is a great attack that can turn a potential loss into a victory, but there is a lot of strategy behind how to go about it. There are great users of the move and there aren't, so choose wisely!</p>
