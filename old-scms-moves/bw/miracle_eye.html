Blocks evasion modifiers. Allows user's Psychic-type moves to hit Dark-types.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Causes the target to have its positive evasion stat stage set to 0 while it is active. Psychic-type attacks can hit the target if it is a Dark-type. The effect ends when the target is no longer active. Fails if the target is already affected. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute. This move cannot miss.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Since moves that raise the user's evasion are banned, this move has little use. Offensive Psychic-types generally have a Fighting-type move for coverage, so Dark-types are not a problem to the point to where the Psychic-type absolutely needs to hit the Dark-type with its STAB Psychic-type moves. Defensive Psychic-types are too weak anyway to make use of this move and are better off just switching out.</p>
