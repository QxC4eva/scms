<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This article covers the Elemental Gems in UU, RU, and NU and is the second in a <a href="/smog/issue25/elemental_gems">two-part Elemental Gem series</a>. These Gems can be used to get past a certain Pokemon's counter to give it a free path to sweep afterwards.</p>

<h2>Different Gems and Their Users</h2>

<h3>Flying Gem: as common as it is pretty</h3>

<p>When we think of Pokemon jewelry, the first item that generally springs  to mind is the Flying Gem. You see, it's almost as if it were created  specifically to be used in conjunction with the move Acrobatics.  Acrobatics only has a measly 55 Base Power on paper, but that doubles to  110 when the user isn't holding an item. But Flying Gem takes it one  step further. Once you use the move the Gem is consumed on the same  turn, so it essentially multiplies 110 by 50%, resulting in a massive  165 Base Power. And that's without taking STAB into consideration! Such  power means that a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics can be used as a  one-time nuke, a move that is sure to crush any opponent that does not  possess titanic Defense or a resistance to it. Unfortunately, these two  attributes often go hand in hand when we think of Rock- and Steel-types,  but the best users of Acrobatics have found a way around them and  consequently into this article.</p>

<p>Tornadus has many advantages in using Flying Gem. For one, it can  outright attack opponents with a huge amount of power straight off. Once  it does that, it can boost its power to what it was before with Bulk Up  and can avoid a Taunt or Will-O-Wisp from Sableye with its own  Prankster Taunt. Tornadus can also 2HKO Snorlax reliably with Flying  Gem, without the Defense and Attack decrease that it would get from  using Superpower. Archeops can use Flying Gem to hit opponents  harder while it still has the power, as its ability, Defeatist, halves  its Attack when it reaches less than 50% HP.</p> 

<p>Sceptile is one of the best users of Flying Gem in the lower tiers,  thanks to Unburden. The ability makes the user's Speed double when it  uses up an item, and that's exactly what happens when it uses  Acrobatics. With the Acrobatics boost, it already makes for a one-time  powerful attack, but with Unburden, its already fast base 120 Speed is  doubled, meaning frail offensive opponents in RU have to rely on  priority or Rock- and Steel-types to take it out. Luckily, Escavalier  can survive Acrobatics and OHKO back in return with Megahorn, while  Pokemon such as Steelix have no problem coming into Sceptile after it's  used the Gem and can easily 2HKO in return. Like Sceptile, Drifblim also  has Unburden and Acrobatics; however, it has the added bonus of getting  STAB from Acrobatics. That's hitting an opponent and making Drifblim  hard to take out for the rest of the match. With its Ghost typing, it is  immune to Mach Punches and only falls to Sucker Punch after the boost.  To combat this, Drifblim can run Substitute and use Will-O-Wisp.  Drifblim can also use Destiny Bond to make use of the boost to its Speed  when it knows it can't finish off an opponent. Kangaskhan is an  exception, however, as the kangaroo commonly runs Scrappy, allowing it  to use Fake Out and wear Drifblim down after a Substitute; however, it  has to be wary of Will-O-Wisp and Destiny Bond.</p>

<p>Charizard is another great user of Flying Gem and benefits from STAB  Acrobatics like most others. When people see Charizard in the current  NU metagame, most assume a Choice Scarf set and generally switch to a  special wall to take whatever attack Charizard is about to launch at  them. Charizard then gets the boost to Acrobatics, which can help it  take out Pokemon that otherwise take very little from its attacks, such  as Altaria, and guarantees the 2HKO without Stealth Rock. In the RU  metagame, Swords Dance can also allow it to boost its Attack and OHKO  Slowking after a turn of set up and works without sun, unlike Grass Gem  Charizard. Jumpluff is the least used out of NU's Flying Gem users, but  Flying Gem and Acrobatics are extremely useful for it, for a variety of  reasons. Flying Gem allows it to get notable KOs on bulkier Pokemon that  may switch in, and proceed to use its high Speed to its advantage by  putting something that may potentially counter it to sleep. After that,  it can set up Swords Dance to regain the power it initially had.</p>

<h3>Grass Gem: graceful but strong</h3>

<p>Grass Gem is used less than Flying Gem, but it has very specific uses in  the lower tiers. Sceptile can make use of Grass Gem much like it makes  use of Flying Gem. Unlike with Acrobatics, Sceptile gets STAB from Leaf  Blade and can activate Unburden after hitting its opponents really hard  and proceed to sweep the rest of the opposing team. Charizard can use  the Grass Gem to get the guaranteed OHKO on most Slowking when under sun  with SolarBeam. This can make it easier for other sun sweepers such as Entei to sweep through teams.</p>

<h3>Ghost Gem: rare but frightful</h3>

<p>Ghost Gem only has one main user in the lower tiers, and that's  Drifblim. When used in conjunction with Unburden, it can become a  powerful special attacker. While Ghost Gem has no extra power like  Acrobatics does, it does give Drifblim a powerful Shadow Ball which can  OHKO Pokemon like Gardevoir after Stealth Rock, compared to 2HKOing it  beforehand. It can also hit other Pokemon such as Musharna harder with  Shadow Ball; however, the purpose of the Gem is to help boost Drifblim's  Speed for the most part. With the extra Speed boost from Unburden,  Drifblim can use Calm Mind against offensive special threats such as  Jynx (even when Scarfed, as Drifblim can now outspeed it due to the  Unburden boost) to boost its Special Defense, which can help it survive  longer and regain power in Shadow Ball. Ghost Gem also works great  against physical walls such as Alomomola that may come in hoping for  Acrobatics and instead face a nasty surprise.</p>

<h3>Normal Gem and Fighting Gem</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/106.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Both of these are mostly used in the lower tiers by Hitmonlee, which is  why they have the same category. Normal Gem is used almost primarily for  Fake Out, which guarantees an Unburden activation due to Fake Out  having priority and causing the opponent to flinch. With the extra  Speed, Hitmonlee can as a result find more opportunities to sweep  opposing teams with Hi Jump Kick. Fighting Gem on the other hand can be  used against a slower opponent to launch a powerful and fast High Jump  Kick, or priority Mach Punch against a faster opponent with the aim of  killing whatever Hitmonlee faces.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>That's the last of the the Elemental Gem series, as the Elemental Gems  have very little use in Ubers, and in LC they work similarly to their  adult counterparts. The next time you're wondering about which item to  use for a Pokemon, consider using an Elemental Gem, as it just might  provide the boost you need.</p>
