move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Pursuit

ability: Clear Body
item: Assault Vest

Moves
========

    Meteor Mash is pretty strong STAB that has a nice chance to boost attack, thus it allows metagross to punish recover stalling pokemon that might be able to beat it otherwise
    Earthquake is a solid coverage move that hits steel, and fire types like Aegislash
    Bullet punch is useful priority, that at max attack hits modestly hard, and can pick off some weakened foes, while doing quite respectable damage to any weaknesses
    Ice punch achieves good coverage with EArthquake, and super effectively is considerably better than a neutral meteor. Special attacking dragons even with super effective moves will not be able to muscle through you right away, and ice punch hits hardest
    Zen Headbutt is a good secondary STAB that hits a number of switch ins for respectable damage, such as Rotom. Rotom that lack Will-O-Wisp, such as the choice set can be beaten one on one with zen headbutt. Zen Headbutt as well allows you to check most fighting types, notably Keldeo, and Conkeldurr as well as dealing significant damage to the ever hard to kill Mega-Venusaur
    Pursuit, although due to a newfound ghost weakness is pretty bad at trapping ghosts, most notably Aegislash, it can still be quite good at beating psychic types. Trapping Latios, and Latias offensive and supporting threats, magic bouners Xatu and Espeon, and revenge killer Alakazam can be very valuable. Pursuit is also a fantastic way to chip away at genesect, locked into Ice beam, and Thunderbolt, or anything else Metagross can tank comfortably.

Set Details
========

    Metagross' natural special bulk combined with Assault vest, and max HP investment give great special bulk, while still improving physical bulk making Metagross a pretty formidable tank
    Max attack, with an Adamant nature is necessary to actually hit the opponent back and be useful


Usage Tips
========

    Thanks to fantastic bulk, and strong offense but generally weak typing, metagross can act as a good tank, but most interestingly, a lure. Gengar's shadow ball, talonflame's flare blitz short of adamant choice band, Landorus-therian's Earthquake as well as Excadrill's, and many very strong super effective attacks can not one hit Metagross, while Metagross retaliates with a massive amount of damage or flat KOs right back
    As mentioned in the move section, pursuit can trap very dangerous pokemon and even those it doesnt kill it can chip away at, switching agressively into latios is recommended


Team Options
========

    Metagross is useless when burned, and has no recovery options. ALthough heal bell and wish support are easy to recommend as helpful team options this Metagross in particular enjoys them quite nicely, and is a very good candidate at receiving them. This is because Metagross although has common weaknesses it has a large profile of resistances and great mixed bulk, meaning that switching into the wish no matter what you're facing is very plausible, and after that Metagross will again after taking a previous beating be able to go to work on whatever it is now staring down.
    Mandibuzz is very good at fighting offensive ghosts, and ground types, as well as fighting types who use ghost, and dark for coverage, but not ice and rock, thus the two form solid defensive synergy.
    A good offensive partner to Metagross is a mixed Kyurem-Black set consisting of Fusion bolt / Ice Beam / Earth power. This is capable of checking a wide profile of Metagross defensive counters, such as skarmory and landorus-therian. Metagross is quite good against Fairies, and can sponge some Dragon attacks aimed at Kyube. A clever double switch to Kyurem-B as the opponent brings in their defensive counter to Metagross can land the opponent on their back foot searching desperately for a switch in.


Utility
########
name: Utility
move 1: Bullet Punch / Pursuit / Trick
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Meteor Mash
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Clear Body
item: Leftovers / Iron Ball
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 hp / 252 atk / 4 def

Moves
========

    Bullet Punch allows Metagross to support the team by being a decent check to weakened sweepers, especially steel weaknesses
    Pursuit traps a number of Psychic-types, and can help ensure damage on an important threat as it flees, weak to Pursuit or not
    Stealth Rock is a valuable entry hazard Metagross has access to, and opportunities to lay it are numerous
    Meteor Mash is a relatively strong STAB move that can put an end to most Fairy-types
    Earthquake achieves good coverage and is great alongside the iron ball
    Trick + Iron Ball is a useful tool that synergies with Metagross' moves and common switch ins crippling them, and anything in general by grounding them and halving their speed after an iron ball is given, though letovers must be given up


Set Details
========

    As Metagross is quite slow, especially when holding an iron ball before tricking it off, no speed investment is necessary, or useful
    Maximum HP investment maximizes mixed bulk for investment
    Maximum attack with adamant lets Metagross deal real damage
    Leftovers greatly improve Metagross longevity,this is valuable to a bulky supporting pokemon and should be used if Trick is not used.


Usage Tips
========

    Potential switch ins to Metagross that can wall it, set up on it, or KO it include but are not limited to Balloon Excadrill, Talonflame, Balloon Heatran, Landorus-Therian, Thundurus, Zapdos, Gyarados, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Skarmory, and more are all really screwed around by Iron Ball, many are incredibly vulnerable to Earthquake after the iron ball, and you will outspeed most of them. Target these pokemon with trick if you see them on the opposing team.
    Charizard who would be completely toppled with iron ball, is immune to trick thanks to mega stones, as are all mega evolutions. Be careful tricking when they are around, though it may fool some into thinking you are choice locked.
    However, despite the utility of iron ball tricking switch ins may not be completely trigger happy to take advantage of Metagross, so using Stealth rock on a switch force is a solid idea and by no means a waste of a turn. Losing your iron ball right away when a good counter exists is unwise.
    Sylveon, Clefable, Togekiss, Tyranitar, Klefki, and a couple other common pokemon can be taken advantage of, do this as much as possible
    Many teams are completely vulnerable to an iron ball trick, and getting stealth rock up early is valuable. Metagross because of this acts as a solid lead that can trick an iron ball onto the opponent, severly crippling it if it relies on speed, perhaps even crippling something incredibly important to the team. Then, outspeeds and sets up rocks before going down.


Team Options
========

    Metagross does not have particularly favorable match up against most spinners and defoggers, especially without an iron ball trick, carrying a spin blocker with this set is ideal
    As well as this pokemon that discourage defog, such as Defiant Bisharp help keep rocks up
    Mandibuzz is very good at fighting offensive ghosts, and ground types, as well as fighting types who use ghost, and dark for coverage, but not ice and rock, thus the two form solid defensive synergy.
    When running Iron Ball trick Mega Pinsir is a surprisingly amazing parnter as nearly every counter to mega Pinsir, especially Skarmory and Rotom-W are eager switch ins to Metagross, and an iron ball tricked to these pokemon leaves them unable to properly check Mega Pinsir.



Other Options
########

    Explosion lets you go out with a bang, it can deal a lot of damage even with "just" 250 base power. In tandem with trick iron ball can create a situation where you can absolutely prevent the opponent from spinning or defogging even if you do not kill them, as defog and rapid spin fail to clear hazards against nothing.
    Rock slide lets you beat volcarona, as +1 timid, max special attack fiery dance will not OHKO assault vest metagross from full health. It also destroys unevolved Charizard X trying to set up on you, Talonflame, and Pinsir.
    Thunderpunch is considerable on the Assault vest set to damage Skarmory, Gyarados, Talonflame, and handful of moderately relevant pokemon like Vaporeon.
    Hammer Arm is your best move against a number of dark types, but the most relevant ones can be covered with other moves, such as Meteor Mash vs. Tyranitar, Earthquake for Bisharp, and Ice Punch against Hydreigon. Hammer Arm is also the best move against Ferrothorn that Metagross can use.
    An Agility set can function as a late game sweeper, however due to poor neutral STAB coverage, as well as only adequate super effective coverage it lacks power and is generally not as good as other Agility sweepers such as Dragonite, Thundurus-T, and Landorus-T.
    A Choice Band set although strong is generally outclassed by other offensive steel types for their superior speed, and coverage.


Checks & Counters
########

    Metagross is slow, and doesnt have the greatest movepool. However, despite this it has just enough to be a bit harder to check than what you might think. Strong Ground-types, such as Garchomp, Landorus-therian, Excadrill, and such are good checks, but none short of Max attack boosting item sets can OHKO Metagross, and can be hit very hard in return. Despite this if you are checking Metagross, it i probably sufficiently weakened.
    Mega Charizard has nothing to fear but Thunderpunch, Earthquake, or Rock Slide depending on Forme, Can not be tricked, and can easily OHKO any set, thus it is a premier switch in, though clever opponents may demolish you
    Once weakened sufficiently strong and fast ghosts, and dark types again have litte trouble ending Metagross
    Rotom-W, and Rotom-H wall Metagross forever, while burning it, and only have to watch out for Iron Ball
    Skarmory turns Metagross into set up bait outside iron ball trickery
    Any fast Will-o-wisp users not Ko'd by bullet punch can severly cripple Metagross to the point where it is nearly useless.
    Aegislash can be offered as a good check, cleanly knocking out metagross with a combination of Shadow Ball and shadow sneak. Metagross' Earthquake is a 2HKO however, thus it can not switch in freely.
