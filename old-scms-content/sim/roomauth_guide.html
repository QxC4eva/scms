<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello Showdown! As many of you know, all public rooms in the server have their own specific ranks for users. Just like from the PS staff, these ranks grant a variety of commands that are used for moderating the server. These ranks appear on the room's user list, in order of level of authority (Room Owner, Room Moderator, Room Driver, and Room Voice), and are given to exemplary users that are trusted to run the respective room. This guideline will clarify the philosophy and use of each rank to help ensure your success as a room auth on the server!</p>

<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>Here are a number of remarks and guidelines to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>While the Room Owners may have their own set of rules to go by for their room, the <a href="http://pokemonshowdown.com/rules">Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! standard rules</a> still apply.</li>
<li>Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! Staff are assigned to moderate not only the Lobby, but also the public rooms on the server. As a result, we ask that you do not alter their status in any way that hinders their ability to moderate the room. The only exception to altering a global staff's rank is if you're willing to promote a Global Driver to Room Moderator.</li>
<li>Please only use your moderating powers when it is required, and don't deliberately abuse them by any means. Your level of authority is given based on trust, and if you prove that you're not mature or trustworthy enough, you will lose said position. All legitimate claims of abuse will be taken seriously, so please show that you are able to use your position responsibly.</li>
<li>If there is a situation that's more suited for a global staff member to handle, then don't hesitate to report it to us and we'll handle it accordingly. This includes dealing with users with inappropriate names, serious offenders that have left the room (as room commands only affect users in the room), users evading punishments, or PM harassment of any sort.</li>
<li>It's not a good idea to interfere with another room mod's decision without consulting them about it first. It's also important not to publicly argue with other room staff members, so if there is a situation that you think requires it, take it to PM or contact a higher-up.</li>
<li>You can use the <strong>/roomauth</strong> command to display a box that lists every ranked user in the room (the command displays a box listing every ranked user in the room the command is used in). The best way to use this is to not make alts of users that were already promoted room authority, so that you don't lose track of who moderates the room.</li>
<li>Room Drivers and up can only use the redirect command for another room in which they have room auth.</li>
<li>As room staff, your role is to improve the chat; a standard warning is not always needed. A verbal warning can sometimes be more effective than a physical warn. For a situation such as light caps, a verbal warning may be suitable.</li>
<li>One of the most important traits to becoming a competent room staff member is the ability to work with the rest of the staff. You are trusted to discuss important issues with them pertaining to the run, and makes sure that everyone is on board when it comes to handle promotions and discipline appeals.</li>

<h2>Ranks</h2>

<p>Note: If you're a Room Owner and are currently reading this, please keep in mind that these ideas are based on the opinions provided amongst the Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! Staff. Whether or not you decide to practice all of these for your rooms is up to you, of course. This is to help users become more adept in having authority within their rooms. We'd like to ensure that we can provide a healthy decision-making process for all rooms.</p>

<h3>Room Voice (+)</h3>

<p>Much like the standard global rank on the server, Room Voice is awarded to users who display a positive presence in the room. This means that they are the ones who actively contribute to the chat, able to help out others when needed, and can get along with the room authority and the rest of the users. When promoted to this rank, it is important that you do not overestimate the influence or power that you have in the room. This means that mini-modding or questioning higher ups are not acceptable. You are expected to be a model user and should set good examples for other users on the chat.</p>

<h3>Room Driver (&percnt;)</h3>

<p>As the next status level, Room Driver is given to users who are trusted to keep room discussions on topic and handle users who are breaking rules on the chat. These powers include:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><strong>Warn (/warn, /kick, or /k)</strong> - An authority command used to remind an unpleasant user to not break a rule.</li>

<li><strong>Mute (/mute or /m)</strong> - An action that is used to prevent a troublesome user from talking in the room for 7 minutes. This should only be reserved for minor offenses such as a mild amount of spamming or a single line of harassing or insulting someone.</li>

<li><strong>Hourmute (/hourmute or /hm)</strong> - A command that prevents a user from talking in the room for 60 minutes. This should be only be applicable for situations where the user breaks a rule to the point where a 7 minute mute won't alleviate the problem.</li>

<li><strong>Unmute (/unmute or /um)</strong> - Lifts a mute from a user. Only undo moderator actions of your own.</li>

<li><strong>Redirect (/redirect or /redir)</strong> - This command is designed to immediately remove the user from the room and send them into the designated room. This option should only be reserved for when a user is completely off topic from what the room suggests, or if otherwise they are still better off post their content elsewhere (tournaments, language, etc.). You can only redirect from and to rooms in which you are a Driver.</li>

<li><strong>Announce (/announce or /wall)</strong> - This command alters your text to make it appear as white text on a blue background in order to make a noticeable announcement on the chat. This can be used for situations where a user needs to announce an important message to the chat.</li>

<li><strong>Tour disqualify (/tour dq)</strong> This command disqualifies a user from a tournament. This should only be used in cases where a participant exhibits an unsportsmanlike behavior in the form of activity or poor conduct when dealing with their opponents in a scripted tournament.

<li><strong>Tour autodq/setautodq (/tour autodq [minutes|off])</strong>: Sets the automatic disqualification timeout. This is preferable for the beginning rounds, ensuring that the beginning portions of a scripted tournament can run in a smooth and timely manner.
</ul>

<p>In order to show that you are able to handle the chat with such commands, you must be able to lead discussion in the chat, help users when necessary, and show that you are mature and capable of handling troublesome situations that may arise on the room.</p>

<h3>Room Moderator (@)</h3>

<p>Once you are promoted to a Room Moderator, you have access to a position of great influence within the room. This position have access to tools that enable a user to deal with a wide variety of situations that they didn't have as a Driver, which means that Room Owners have to be very careful when considering someone to this rank. Because of that, this position requires a potentially-promoted Room Driver to be trustworthy and mature, as well as having the judgment and responsibility required to handle any situation that may arise from the room. These members are considered leaders of the room, and are able to appoint Room Voices as well. Including the commands from above, Room Moderators are also equipped with:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><strong>Room Ban (/roomban or /rb)</strong> - This command bans the user from the room up until a server restart. This command should only be considered in serious situations where a user is being a highly negative presence to the point where a mute won't suffice. Situations may include harassing several users, spamming, or constant repeat offending.</li>

<li><strong>Room Unban (/roomunban)</strong> - Unbans the user from the room.</li>

<li><strong>Modchat Autoconfirmed (/modchat autoconfirmed or /modchat ac)</strong> - Sets the chat to where only users who are registered for one week and have won a rated battle can talk. This should be used in situations where there are repeated spammers or rule breakers and is helpful in discouraging them away from the room. If it is the same user repeatedly spamming or breaking rules and evading punishments, contact a global staff member.</li>

<li><strong>Modchat + (/modchat +)</strong> - Sets the chat to where only Voices or higher can talk in the room. This should only be used in situations where you may need to tone the chat down from bad topics or situations, or for when you need to mute multiple offenders at a given time.</li>

<li><strong>Room Voice (/roomvoice)</strong> - Promotes a user to a Voice in the room. This command should be used wisely, and you must keep in mind that this is a position of status and Voices are considered to be exemplary users that regular users would admire. As a Moderator, you are encouraged to discuss with the other room authority about who you feel may be worthy of Voice. You should also check with at least one Room Owner on whether they approve or not before promoting someone to Voice. That said, Room Owners are encouraged to Voice anyone who they feel deserves it.</li>

<li><strong>Room Devoice (/roomdevoice)</strong> - Removes Voice from a user in the room. This is similar to the process with promoting someone to Voice. A candidate must have approval from the majority of the Room Moderators, or a Room Owner can choose to remove it from someone who deserves it. This should be considered for Voices who prove to be poor users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Room Owner (#)</h3>

<p>As the most powerful position within the room staff, Room Owners are considered the heads of the room and thus have the final say of everything that goes on in them. This ranges from the direction of the rooms to bans, promotions, and demotions. They are appointed, with approval of a Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! Administrator and support from all of the other Room Owners. While Room Owners are typically not as active in their rooms as the rest of the room staff, their roles are based on leadership potential/experience, the ability to compromise, level of judgement, and the ability to work with the rest of the staff. In order to adapt to this position, one must keep in mind of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are most responsible to what goes on within the room staff, regarding the users that you choose to work with/promote, the additional guidelines and topics that take place in the room, and situations that may require your assistance within the room staff and userbase.</li>

<li>Communication among the staff is the key. It's a good idea to hold regular staff meetings and owner meetings using a communication service such as IRC, Chatzy, Skype, Smogon (PM Conversations), PiratePad or a third party server. In these meetings, make plans to improve the room and keep it on the right track! Some things to talk about might be promotions, demotions, or room suggestions. Give the chance for all staff to voice their view, as their views shouldn't be considered inferior because of a lower rank.</li>

<li>Try to think of things that your room can offer users (getting the Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! staff involved in some way can really work wonders!). Give users a reason for them to come to your room and keep coming back. As a room owner, your job is to provide users with a place to discuss the room topic freely.</li>

<li>When dealing with disputes between two of more of your room staff members, one of the most important steps to take is to try to avoid taking sides in arguments. As a Room Owner, your job is to hear from each side and work towards a solution that will compromise any issues that may arise within the room staff.</li>

<li>While you are entrusted to run the room, remember that no one is always right and that you should take into consideration others' thoughts on room decisions. However, remember that you always have the final word.</li>
</ul>

<p>Including everything mentioned above, Room Owners have access to the following commands:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><strong>Roomintro (/roomintro)</strong> - Sets the room introduction to the room join page. This is the message that you're going to want to provide if you want to describe aspects of the room as well specific guidelines for users to go by. This message should make clear what the room is for in order to attract interested users.</li>
<li><strong>Room Rules (/rules <link>)</strong> - Sets the link to the room rules. This will be shown along with the global rules when the command is broadcast.</li>
<li><strong>Room Driver (/roomdriver)</strong> - Promotes a user to Room Driver.</li>
<li><strong>Room De-Driver (/roomdedriver)</strong> - Demotes an existing Room Driver.</li>
<li><strong>Room Moderator (/roommod)</strong> - Promotes a user to Room Moderator.</li>
<li><strong>Room De-Mod (/roomdemod)</strong> - Demotes an existing Room Moderator.</li>
<li><strong>Room De-auth (/roomdeauth)</strong> - Demotes an existing room staff member from the room staff list.</li>
<li><strong>Declare (/declare message)</strong> - Makes a declaration more prominent than one from the /wall command, and removes your name from the message. This allows links/images to be broadcast responsibly.</li>
<li><strong>Modchat # (/modchat #)</strong> - Sets the chat to where only Room Owners can talk. Technically, Room Owners can also set the modchat up to '~' as well, but modchat # is important to mention in case there's an important announcement for the Room Owners to make for the room.</li>
<li><strong>
</ul>
