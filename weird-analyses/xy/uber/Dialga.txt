Moves
========

- Draco Meteor high base power helps make up for the lack of investment and let Dialga dent things and KO Giratina-O
- Stealth Rock is a key utility move and the main reason to use this set
- Toxic cripples support Arceus formes preventing them from spamming Defog
- Fire Blast has good coverage with Draco Meteor and roasts Scizor before it can Superpower or Defog
- Roar prevents Dialga from being setup fodder and lets it abuse hazards
- Thunder hurts Kyogre

Set Details
========

- Maximum special bulk lets Dialga come in on support Arceus as many times as possible while serving as a check to offensive Kyogre variants


Usage Tips
========

- Don't be predictable with your leads otherwise you'll find yourself starting games off with your Dialga against your opponent's Ground-type
- Take advantage of the fact Dialga beats Defog users to keep Stealth Rock up throughout the game
- At the same time, watch out for Scizor's Superpower, Earthquake from Giratina-O, and Will-O-Wisp from support Arceus formes so that Dialga stays healthy enough for the things you need it for
- Dialga is a good Choice Scarf Kyogre check and can switch into Choice Specs Surf but don't rely too much on this as you'll often find yourself asking more out of Dialga than it has the HP to do
- Dialga's bulk, typing, and strong Draco Meteor makes it very good at trading with Pokemon one-on-one


Team Options
========

- Dialga reduces the need to run strong Kyogre checks like Palkia, but keep in mind that Dialga will fall to defensive Kyogre and can only beat Choice Kyogre if it doesn't have to switch in often. Avoid using Pokemon that give Kyogre free turns, especially Choice Specs Kyogre.
- Running powerful special attackers, like Deoxys-A or Thundurus, that can punish your opponent for leading with a Ground-type increases the odds of you starting the game in a favorable position.
- Every team appreciates constantly having Stealth Rock up but Dialga's reliability at maintaining the entry hazard can help serve as an indirect check to threats like Ho-Oh and Charizard for teams that are weak to them.


Other Options
########

- Stone Edge can make quick work of a Ho-Oh but Dialga rarely has difficulties in dealing one, especially as it is such a reliable Stealth Rock setter.

- Heal Block can prevent the use of Rest and other recovery moves for your opponent's team for 5 turns but Dialga has better options while switching around will quickly end those 5 turns.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Dialga can't really do anything to Fairy-types besides crippling them with Toxic or Fire Blast in the case of Klefki. However, Defensive Xerneas and Heal Bell Sylveon aren't even bothered by the use of Toxic while Dialga that opt for Roar become total Spikes fodder for Klefki.

**Ground-types**: Generally, the biggest struggle in dealing with Dialga is killing it, especially while trying to avoid trading blows. Groudon and Landorus-T both have powerful Earthquakes that will OHKO even a completely healthy Dialga if they run an offensive variant. Defensive variants of the Ground-types will still be able to heavily harm Dialga but keep in mind that they fail to OHKO by a large margin, often forcing you to trade your Earthquake for a Draco Meteor when dealing with a healthy Dialga. Short of Excadrill, Ground-types also have a lot of difficulty switching in directly due to Draco Meteor.

**Defensive Kyogre**: Defensive Kyogre, especially with heavy special defense investment, can comfortably sponge most of Dialga's attacks. Rest heals off status and damage while Scald will eventually cripple Dialga with a burn that will eat its HP.

**Fighting-types**: Blaziken and Mega Mewtwo X can both OHKO Dialga with Low Kick or use Bulk Up and Drain Punch to setup on Dialga in the case of Mewtwo. Neither enjoy trying to switch in on Dialga.

**Shadow Tag**: Gengar often use Focus Blast which allows it to trap and eliminate a softened Dialga. Gothitelle has no difficulty in setting up on defensive Dialga with Calm Mind unless it runs Roar. Wobbuffet can transform Dialga without Flash Cannon into a nearly completely free Geomancy for Xerneas thanks to Safegaurd blocking status and Encore locking Dialga out of Roar.
