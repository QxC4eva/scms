<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>An Other Metagame of the Month is a metagame that is selected and then voted upon by users. The chosen metagame will be available to be played on <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/">Pok&eacute;mon Showdown!</a> for the entire month. I will be using OMotM throughout this article, which is an abbreviation of Other Metagame of the Month. Anyway, all voting occurs here on the forums by users in this thread. The entire process is quite simple: users nominate metagames, vote on one metagame, and the winning metagame gets a ladder for the month. Not every metagame is eligible, though; such ineligible metagames include permanent ladders, ladders in a cooldown phase, or Pet Mods. Once the metagame is selected, the ladder is usually up on the first of the month. A great place for discussion of the OMotM in the <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/othermetas">Other Metas room</a> on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! or in the OMotM's thread itself; positive discussion is a great way to get the metagame to be more active. Once the month is over, the ladder is then removed; but fear not, playing with your friends is still an option through challenge! A great accomplishment is topping #1 on the ladder, and although there is no prize or reward for getting there, you do gain satisfaction and bragging rights. This article will be discussing the current OMotM and previous OMotMs; let's get to it!</p>

<h4>Other Metagame of the Month for May: Almost Any Ability</h4>
<p>Almost Any Ability was the selected OMotM for the month of May. This metagame's name describes exactly what it is: Pok&eacute;mon have access to almost any ability! A banlist is put in place to prevent overpowered abilities such as Contrary, Wonder Guard, and Huge Power from being used on everything. A few Pok&eacute;mon are banned for various reasons as well, such as Kyurem-B, Keldeo, and Weavile. This metagame was very successful, and therefore featured as a permanent ladder. Almost Any Ability was quite a bit ahead in the voting phase, leading with a total of 17 votes, compared to the runner-up, Six Move Battling, which only had 12 votes. This metagame was originally submitted by Monte Cristo; however, asterat eventually took it over due to Monte Cristo's inactivity. This tier is regarded as one of the most popular Other Metagames and has quite a large playerbase as well!</p>

<h4>Other Metagame of the Month for June: STABmons</h4>
<p>STABmons is a metagame in which all Pok&eacute;mon are now able to use any move that's the same type as they are. For instance, Keldeo has access to Water Spout and Vacuum Wave in STABmons because it is a Water / Fighting type. This also applies to pre-evolutions as well, meaning that Altaria can use Boomburst because its pre-evolution, Swablu, is a Normal-type. There are a few bans as well, the two primary ones being Sylveon and Porygon-Z. There are also a few Uber Pok&eacute;mon that are allowed, including Aegislash, Deoxys-S, and Deoxys-D. Led by <a href="/forums/members/.41805/">The Eevee General</a>, this is one of the more popular metagames and is currently having a ladder challenge you can find <a href="/forums/threads/.3519142/">here</a>! This metagame won by a solid 9 votes at 27 total, with Mergemons coming in second with a score of 18. This metagame has a permanent ladder on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! thanks to its positive reception and popularity.</p>

<h4>Other Metagame of the Month for July: Mediocremons</h4>
<p>Mediocremons is exactly what it sounds like: mediocre. Not the metagame itself, but more so the actual Pok&eacute;mon that can be used in the tier. Any Pok&eacute;mon with a base stat of 100 or above is banned from the metagame, allowing the metagame to truly shine on the 'mediocre' part of the tier. Some new Pok&eacute;mon almost unheard of in standard play such as Glalie can be utilized viably in the metagame. It had a very active ladder and was a very popular tournament format in the Other Metagames room; however, it did not receive a permanent ladder. This metagame is available via challenge, though! User <a href="/forums/members/snaquaza.184862/">Snaquaza</a> submitted this metagame and was a firm advocate of it. He introduced the users of the Other Metagames room to the tier, and it received very positive feedback from most users! This metagame won with a landslide vote of 41 to 12, with Mergemons coming in second once again.</p>

<h4>Other Metagame of the Month for August: Metagamiate</h4>
<p>Metagamiate has a basic premise: all Pok&eacute;mon receive an '-ate' ability corresponding to their primary types. The '-ate' abilities act like Aerilate, Refrigerate, and Pixilate but are different for each respective typing. This led to the obviously powerful Extreme Speed that many Pok&eacute;mon such as Lucario and Arcanine used effectively. Like Mediocremons, Metagamiate did not receive a permanent ladder. It did, however, stay as a challenge-only format. This metagame was submitted by user <a href="/forums/members/pikachuun.171701/">Pikachuun</a> and was quite liked in the Other Metagames room by many users. The voting for this to be approved for OMotM was quite close, with Metagamiate having 36 votes and Sketchmons having 35!</p>

<h4>Other Metagame of the Month for September: Haxmons</h4>
<p>Haxmons is another metagame that has a relation to its own name. This metagame features one of competitive Pok&eacute;mon's worst aspects: hax. Nobody likes that awful hax that costs you a game, or that one time when the Thunder Wave's paralysis made you lose your Clefable; it's just awful. Well, this metagame is actually <em>capitalizing</em> on hax and even promoting it. All moves with secondary side effects will have their side effects activate, moves that can miss will miss, and all attacks will land a critical hit; sounds like a wonderful metagame, doesn't it? This metagame had a very positive feedback despite these frustrations occurring every battle; winning by three votes ahead of 350 Cup with a total of 48 votes. This metagame was submitted by <a href="/forums/members/snaquaza.184862/">Snaquaza</a>!</p>

<h4>Other Metagame of the Month for October: Hidden Type</h4>
<p>Hidden Type was OMotM in October and was submitted by an Other Metagames mod, <a href="/forums/members/the-immortal.62285/">The Immortal</a>. Hidden Type highlights a feature rarely tweaked in OMs: IVs. IVs determine the Hidden Power of a Pok&eacute;mon, and the type of this Hidden Power is now a type added to the Pok&eacute;mon using it. For instance, if a Blissey was sent into this format without any adjustments, it would become a Normal / Dark type because 31 IVs across the board is equivalent to a Dark-type Hidden Power. This metagame had an active ladder and was a very positive topic of discussion. Although this metagame did not receive a permanent ladder, it is still available through challenge. This metagame had a very large vote count of 47, compared to 350 Cup, the runner-up, which only had 25 votes.</p>
