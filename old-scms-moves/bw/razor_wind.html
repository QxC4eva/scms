<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage on the turn after it is used. If the move is prevented from being used after the user has charged up, then the entire move is canceled, but PP is still deducted. If the user holds the item Power Herb, the move will not require a turn to charge. Assuming there are no other critical hit modifiers in play, this move has a 1/8 chance to get a critical hit instead of a 1/16 chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Razor Wind should not be used competitively, because it is a two-turn charge up Normal-type move. Return or Double-Edge should always be chosen over Razor Wind in a competitive battle.</p>
