<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3455879">The Scramble Challange MkII</a></strong> is a community driven challenge for in-game playthroughs. Scramblers are only allowed to use Pokemon that are randomly assigned by users on the forums.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/forums/threads/the-nuzlocke-challenge-mark-2.3487856/">The Nuzlocke Challenge MkII</a></strong> only allows users to catch the first Pokemon they run into on each route. Furthermore, should that Pokemon faint at any time, it can no longer be used for that game. Make up your own rules to give the challenge a little boost in difficulty!</p>

<p><strong><a href="/forums/threads/the-gauntlet-challenge-2-0.3514488/">The Gauntlet Challenge 2.0</a></strong> is similar to Scrambles, but instead of being assigned Pokemon, challengers are assigned gauntlets that vary from full playthrough restrictions to one-time area or battle challenges.</p>
