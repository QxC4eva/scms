<p>Welcome back to Trivia, fellow Smogon students. What? I'm not Level 51?  Well, he's off searching for the ever-elusive Zystral. It seems Birkal  couldn't hold him back any longer. Let's just ignore the fact that I  have no idea what I am doing and move on to what you guys are really  interested in.</p>

<p>As you know with Trivia, the winner of each issue can claim the prize of a custom title by PMing an administrator! This issue, ahEe8olB3EkWRgT, PMIT, and TheCanadianWifier are all tied up as winners! Congratulations to them, and maybe if you PM <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/private.php?do=newpm&amp;u=32443">The Smog</a> with your answers, you'll be the next winner! Here are the answers:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>As of Gen IV, TMs have been  color-coded according to their type.  However, in BW, two TMs were  colored incorrectly. Which two were these?</strong><br />
TM67 Retaliate appeared as a Dark-type TM in the Japanese versions;  meanwhile, TM94 Rock Smash appeared as a Rock-type TM in both the  Japanese and International releases.</li>
<li><strong>Traditionally, move animations involve minimal movement of the   Pok&eacute;mon sprites themselves. However, some animations involve the user   moving all the way to the other side of the field (where the opponent   is)! Name one of these moves.</strong><br />
Any Pok&eacute;mon using Snatch will be seen to move across the  opponent's side of the field in earlier generations such as RSE. Other such moves include Fly, Sky Drop, Bounce, Brave Bird, U-turn, and ExtremeSpeed.</li>
<li><strong>Let's say you're battling in a VGC tournament. On your side is   Pok&eacute;mon X, which is a Trick Room setter, and an Amoonguss; on your   opponent's side is a Hitmontop and an Infernape. With this data in mind,   you are completely sure that you will be able to set up Trick Room  this  turn. Which Pok&eacute;mon could X be?</strong><br />
Assuming both sides use standard or close-to-standard movesets, Hypno,  Cofagrigus, Jellicent, Dusclops, and Dusknoir can all take Choiced Flare  Blitz and Fire Blast fairly easily while also being immune to Fake Out  (Jellicent can survive a ThunderPunch). Note that Hitmontop's turn is  wasted using Fake Out on Amoonguss, so it can't use Rage Powder. If we're  going to send hax into the equation, the only way you can guarantee  Trick Room is with a Choice Scarf Rage Powder Amoonguss and an Inner  Focus Hypno (since Ghost-types can still be flinched by Rock Slide and  stuff like that).</li>
<li><strong>Which starter Pok&eacute;mon in the main games did not have a move super   effective against Magneton in the generation it (the starter) was   released?</strong><br />
In Generation I, Venusaur's offensive moveset consisted only of  Grass- and Normal-type moves. Thus, it was unable to hit Magneton super  effectively. Pikachu does not have any super effective move against Magneton in Yellow as well.</li>
<li><strong>In the Pok&eacute;mon World Tournament, you can download tournaments involving the top 4 players at the 2012 VGC from each division. Which   item is used the most, and on which teams does it not feature? (Note   that we are not including World Finalist Brendan's initial team, which   was distributed from Oct. 21 to 23, 2012 and was erroneous.)</strong><br />
With only Abram's (Junior), Brian's (Junior), Henry's (Senior), and  Abel's (Master) teams not featuring it, the Sitrus Berry was the most  common item among the 12 teams.</li>
<li><strong>Which floor of the Kanto Victory Road always holds at least one TM regardless of which version you are playing?</strong><br />
Floor 2 holds TM05 Mega Kick and TM17 Submission in RBY, TM26 Earthquake  in GSC and HGSS, and TM07 Hail and TM37 Sandstorm in FRLG.</li>
<li><strong>How many dual-type Pok&eacute;mon are immune to at least one of their STABs?</strong><br />
There are 33 such fully evolved Pok&eacute;mon&mdash;Stunfisk,  Landorus, Landorus-T, Houndoom, Heatran, Chandelure,  Poliwrath, Lapras, Lanturn, Mantine, Quagsire, Seismitoad, Jellicent,  Sawsbuck, Emolga, Gastrodon, Thundurus-T, Claydol, Flygon, Gligar, Gliscor, Houndour, Litwick, Lampent, Chinchou, Mantyke, Wooper, Palpitoad, Frillish, Deerling, Baltoy, Vibrava, and Shedinja.</li>
<li><strong>If I have a Rotom-C with Leaf Storm and Thunderbolt, its moveset  will revert to simply Thunderbolt when I change it back to its original forme. What happens when I convert a Rotom-W with only Hydro Pump back  to its original forme?</strong><br />
It will have a moveset consisting of only ThunderShock.</li>
<li><strong>Name all the moves of non-zero priority in Generation I.</strong><br />
Quick Attack and Counter.</li>
<li><strong>I send in a Musharna with Forewarn into an opponent's Gastrodon with Return/Earthquake/Waterfall/Mirror Coat. Which move am I alerted to?</strong><br />
Because Forewarn treats it as a 120 Base Power move, I will be alerted to Mirror Coat.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I've found a little sticky note on Level 51's desk aside his  "Birkal cannot stop me anymore, I will find Zystral!" message. So you  can attribute (and blame) the first question on him. A fellow friend of  mine, Mack the Knife, has joined me, and you can attribute (and blame)  questions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on him.</p>

<ol>
<li>Name all the abilities which affect wild encounter rates.</li>
<li>What are the towns of Johto named after?</li>
<li>Who is the only Elite 4 member to use an Eeveelution introduced in Generation 1?</li>
<li>Who voiced Flannery in the Japanese Anime?</li>
<li>What is the only Pok&eacute;mon used by Pike Queen Lucy that is not based on a serpent?</li>
<li>Name all abilities that affect accuracy.</li>
<li>What characters can you play as in the most recent Pokémon Mystery Dungeon game?</li>
<li>Which anime character made a baseball reference nearly every time he/she appeared on screen?</li>
<li>Name at least two Pok&acute;mon in the TV show that have appeared at one time or another at a size larger than usual.</li>
<li>What was the English name of the first BW anime episode?</li>
</ol>
