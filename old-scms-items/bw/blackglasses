Raises power of Dark-type moves 20%.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the power of all of the holder's damage-dealing Dark-type attacks by 20%.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>BlackGlasses aren't bad, but they aren't that good either. While a 20% boost to Dark-type attacks is decent, it's not quite as excellent as the 30% boost to all attacks that you get from Life Orb. If you don't like Life Orb's recoil damage, or want to try to bluff a Choice item, then Expert Belt is typically a better overall choice for its added damage to all super effective attacks. Even if you are running a mono-attacking set with Dark coverage (not recommended), either Leftovers or Life Orb would probably be better for your purposes, depending on your build.</p>
