<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user copies all the target's stat changes exactly. This move cannot be blocked by Protect or Detect. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Psych Up is a very situational move. Copying the opponent's boosts is great and all, but the effect is ultimately under the opponent's control. Psych Up's most likely area of success is probably in combating Bulk Up and Calm Mind users. All in all, though, there are plenty of other, less contrived ways to prevent a setup sweeper from going out of control.</p>
