<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As you hopefully know, LC is a tier filled only with baby and  first-evolution Pokémon, and naturally, like all other tiers, it has  some very effective Pokémon and some not so effective. Every now and  then, you will verse someone on the LC ladder saying something like:  "This team is the baby version of my OU team!" These same people end up  scratching their head after a battle wondering why they lost. The reason  is that not all LC Pokémon have the same level of success as their  fully evolved OU counterparts. However, in this article you will find a  few Pokémon that take after their parents, having around the same amount  of success in LC as their fully evolved counterparts have in OU.</p>

<h2>The Baby-Parent Pairs</h2>

<h3>Staryu and Starmie</h3>

<p>Staryu and Starmie have the exact same asset, which is the reason why  they are both so effective in their respective tiers. That asset is  being arguably the best spinner in their respective tiers. Staryu is  blessed with a great base 85 Speed, letting it reach the awesome Speed  tier of 19 and hence outspeed all unboosted Pokémon with the exception  of Voltorb, Elekid, and Diglett. Its base 70 Special Attack is also good  by LC standards, and along with its great Speed and good special  movepool including Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt, Staryu is a great  spinner. Eviolite and Recover help to boost its longevity, allowing it  to Rapid Spin throughout the game. Like Staryu, Starmie is also blessed  with a great Special Attack and Speed, having base 100 and 115  respectively. Starmie is commonly seen using a more offensive Rapid Spin  set than its pre-evolution, using 252 EVs in Special Attack and Speed, a  Life Orb, and 3 special attacks (usually Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and  Thunderbolt). However, due to the release of Keldeo and rain's dominance  in general, defensive Starmie sets with Recover, Psyshock, Scald, and a  more bulky EV spread have started to rise in popularity. One thing is  certain: these two Pokémon are very effective spinners and are quite  easy to fit on any team that doesn't have like 3 Water-types.</p>

<h3>Ferroseed and Ferrothorn</h3>

<p>Our spiky friends over here have both been quite successful in their  respective tiers, being two of the best Steel-types and hazard setters.  Firstly, they are both able to learn Stealth Rock and Spikes, the best  entry hazards available, and they both have the bulk and typing to set  them up quite easily. Grass / Steel is a very good defensive typing,  giving the two only two weaknesses, the least out of any Grass-types.  However, it's one of these two weaknesses that makes Ferroseed and  Ferrothorn not as "tough" as they initially seem. Fighting-types are  everywhere in OU and LC, with Pokémon like Mienfoo, Croagunk, Timburr,  and Scraggy being quite common in LC and Terrakion, Keldeo, Breloom, and  Conkeldurr on many OU teams. Not only can Ferroseed and Ferrothorn use  their mighty bulk to set up hazards, but they also have other forms of  support in Leech Seed to drain away their opponents' health and heal up  their teammates, and Thunder Wave to cripple the opponents Pokémon by  paralyzing them. Rain is very common in OU, so Ferrothorn is a good  Pokémon to fit on your team if you are looking for a Water-type resist.</p>

<h3>Riolu and Lucario</h3>

<p>Unlike the first two pairs of Pokémon in this article, Riolu and Lucario  function very differently. However, they share one thing in common:  being top-tier threats! Riolu, unlike its older brother, is blessed with  potentially the most annoying ability in the game: Prankster. This, in  tandem with the move Copycat, grants Riolu the position of the most  unique Pokémon in Little Cup. This allows Riolu to have priority on the  most recently used move. When combined with Protect, Riolu can both  avoid strong hits such as Scraggy's Hi Jump Kick, Misdreavus's Shadow  Ball, and Murkrow's Brave Bird and have priority in using them himself.  Offensively, these moves can be used to revenge opposing threats, while  defensively, Riolu can copy support moves such as Stealth Rock, Spikes,  Knock Off, or Recover / Slack Off. Riolu likewise has access to Roar,  meaning when all conditions are right, it can use Copycat to give it a  priority Roar. Finally, it utilizes its good bulk and defensive typing  to take advantage of all these traits to harass the enemy. Lucario on  the other hand does not have Prankster but makes up for it in sheer  sweeping potential. With access to good priority moves in ExtremeSpeed  and Bullet Punch, an awesome base 110 Attack, and decent base 90 Speed,  Lucario can threaten to pick off even fast threats in OU like Terrakion  and Latios if it has grabbed a Swords Dance boost. Its STAB Close Combat  is also extremely powerful, and to round it off, Lucario can run either  Crunch or Ice Punch to help cover either the Ghost-, Flying-, or  Psychic-Types that resist Close Combat.</p>

<h3>Hippopotas and Hippowdon</h3>

<p>When someone looks at Hippopotas or Hippowdon, the thing they probably  think of right away would be SAND STREAM! This ability defines a whole  playstyle, so naturally, anytime you verse a Hippopotas or Hippowdon,  you have to prepare for a few things. Firstly, everything but Steel-,  Rock-, and Ground-types will have 6.25% of their health taken off at the  end of each turn. Secondly, you have to watch out if your opponent is  carrying a Sand Rush Pokémon, which commonly happens if they are using  Hippopotas or Hippowdon. Sand Rush Pokémon get their Speed doubled in  sand, turning them into very dangerous sweepers; Drilbur and Sandshrew  both use it in LC, while Sandslash and Stoutland do so in OU. Sand is  not the only reason why these two Pokémon are viable in their respective  tiers. They also have immense Defense and a wide array of support moves  to go with it, including Whirlwind, Yawn, Toxic, and Crunch. They both  can also recover health using Slack Off. All in all, they are both quite  good Pokémon, but Hippowdon does face competition as a Sand Stream  Pokémon from Tyranitar, and there are also other permanent weather  effects in OU with Politoed providing Drizzle, Ninetails providing  Drought, and Abomasnow providing Snow Warning. All you have to worry  about in LC if using Hippopotas is Snover's Snow Warning. The two hippos  also are not slouches offensively as they both pack a powerful  Earthquake and can run other coverage moves too. Hippowdon is sometimes  seen carrying Ice Fang so it can punish Dragon-types or even Grass-types  that think they can hit it super effectively. Hippopotas on the other  hand is commonly seen with Crunch, to hit Natu super effectively, which  might try to bounce back Toxic or Stealth Rock due to Magic Bounce. It  also hits Misdreavus super effectively, one of the tier's biggest  threats. Rock Slide is also seen quite regularly because it provides a  pseudo EdgeQuake combo with Earthquake and can hit Murkrow super  effectively, one of the biggest offensive threats in the tier. Of course  it can punish Pokémon like Natu too!</p>

<h3>Magnemite and Magnezone</h3>

<p>Magnemite and Magnezone both have great Special Attack stats of base 95  and 130 respectively, and they both have the amazing ability, Magnet  Pull, which prevents Steel-types from switching out when they are on the  field. Since they both have very high Special Attack, Magnet Pull  allows them to trap and beat down many Steel-types. Magnezone is a bit  luckier that it has more Steel-types to trap than Magnemite with  Ferrothorn and Forretress both having a 4x Fire-type weakness for it to  exploit with Hidden Power Fire. Magnemite, on the other hand, can trap  Ferroseed and Bronzor. Magnemite also acts as a good Snover and Murkrow  check, which are two of the biggest offensive threats in the tier.  Magnemite resists both their STABs and can hit both of them with its own  STAB moves. Flash Cannon hits Snover super effectively while  Thunderbolt / Volt Switch hits Murkrow super effectively. The ability to  check common Pokemon such as Lileep and Pawniard along with the above  traits makes Magnemite one of the most common pivots on a Little Cup  team, used as a bulky wall or a strong Choice Scarf Pokemon.  Furthermore, access to Magnet Rise lets Magnemite check Hippopotas,  Drilbur, and Sandshrew (assuming it has used it before facing either  mole), while also allowing it to avoid Bronzor's Earthquake.  Magnezone also has some functions aside from trapping Steel-types,  mainly being a potent Choice Specs user that can threaten a lot of rain  teams with its powerful Electric-type STAB.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thank you for reading! I hope this article helps encourage OU players to  play LC and aids them in teambuilding and vice versa! For those LC  players that find it hard building OU teams, you could perhaps try out  the OU Pokémon in this article. If you guys use the Pokémon in this  article correctly, regardless of if they are LC or OU I am sure you will  not be disappointed&mdash;unless you're using LC Pokémon in OU,  which you should never EVER do. Oh, except trolling with Prankster Riolu  in OU; that is actually quite fun!</p>
