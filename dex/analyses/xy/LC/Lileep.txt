Overview
########

- Has access to Stealth Rock, more important in this generation than ever what with Sturdy + Berry Juice and Murkrow, Fletchling, Larvesta, SR weak Pokemon etc., turning 2HKOs to OHKOs
- Can wall special attackers that don't have a set up move, ie Abra, Chinchou, Misdreavus, Staryu, Gastly, Ponyta
- Walls most if not all the Chlorophyll Sweepers and can at least 2HKO them back with HP Fire
- Grass-Type is immune to Sleep Powder, Spore, and Stun Spore
- Can Wall physical attackers that don't set up and lack a super effective move on it, even some that do, ie Ponyta, Murkrow (LO BB does 50% to it though so you can't switch in but you can recover stall), Fletchling, etc.
- Can Toxic stall some walls that most Pokemon can't get through, ie Calm Mind Spritzee
- Weak to Steel and Fighting-Type moves, so Meditite, Mienfoo, Timburr, Pawniard, Magnemite which of whom are very common :/
- Is set up bait to Misdreavus and other Pokemon

move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Recover
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Ancient Power / Toxic
ability: Storm Drain
item: Eviolite
evs: 228 HP / 140 Def / 140 SpD
nature: Bold / Calm

Moves
========

- Stealth Rock is an important hazard move and Lileep is one of the few walls with a recovery move that get it
- Giga Drain is STAB and recovers HP, as well as threatening Staryu and Drilbur, 2 of the most common Rapid Spin users, for SE damage
- Recover for longevity
- Hidden Power Fire is a good coverage move and hits Foongus, Ferroseed, Chlorophyll sweepers, and hurts Pawniard and Magnemite
- Ancient Power is STAB with a fun 10% chance as well as hitting most Defog users (Vullaby), Murkrow, Larvesta, and Fletchling for SE damage. Also makes it a good check to Mixkrow.
- Toxic wears down walls it would be otherwise unable to harm
- Earth Power and Hidden Power  Fighting could be cool for Fire- or Steel-Type coverage, namely  Magnemite and Pawniard, but offer less coverage on other important Pokemon and often won't OHKO Magnemite or Eviolite Pawniard back

Set Details
========

-  EVs grant maximum defense, Bold is if you want Murkrow to do about 50% or less to you, Calm is if you want to take on Special attackers a bit better, the max HP helps you survive certain 2HKOs you otherwise wouldn't be able to at full HP

Usage Tips
========

- Use sparingly, Stealth Rock is Lileep's main purpose, the second is to wall or pivot against Pokemon that other Pokemon usually can't, namely Foongus, Abra, Staryu, Chinchou, Ponyta, and etc.
- It can often be the weakest link on a team, despite having great niches, sometimes it is better to just use Stealth Rock and then sacrafice it to get in another Pokemon safely

Team Options
========

- Slowpoke and Ponyta/Mienfoo/Timburr make a great pivot core, being able to switch in on most Pokemon in the metagame
- Use it with Pokemon who hate the Pokemon that Lileep walls/pivots into and/or appreciate Stealth Rock
- Likes things that can take on steel- or fighting-types. your own Fighting-types can easily take on Pawniard and other steels, whilst a Larvesta or Ponyta can help switch into fighting-types and also still take on Pawniard.


Other Options
########

- Amnesia, Barrier, Stockpile, Curse, Swords Dance are alright, but it really doesn't help you beat most of Lileep's common checks or counters and you end up wasting a turn you could have used Stealth Rock on
- Mirror Coat could be a fun surprise, but is too situational
- Rock Slide and Bullet Seed are alright if you want to use physical-type moves, but Giga Drain's recovery is superior
- Hidden Power Rock is an option as this allows it to not be PP Stalled by SubRoost Murkrow.


Checks & Counters
########

- Meditite, Mienfoo, and Timburr all threaten it with an SE STAB Fighting-Type move and the latter two can use Knock Off if they predict a switch
- Pawniard and Magnemite both resist Giga Drain, Ancient Power, and Toxic, and have a SE STAB Steel-Type move that they can 2HKO Lileep with, but watch out for Hidden Power Fighting and Earth Power respectively
- Misdreavus can set up on it and beat it one on one
- Fletchling can set up on it if it lacks Ancient Power and beat it one on one
- Calm Mind Spritzee can set up on it and beat it one on one, but hates Toxic
