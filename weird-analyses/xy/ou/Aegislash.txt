Aegislash Skeleton

Overview
########
- Amazing bulk and power makes Aegislash great tank
- It is a wallbreaker that checks a ton of Pokemon and can spinblock.
- Good boosting moves in Swords Dance and Autotomize, allowing it to take a sweeping role.
- It has priority and King's Shield to check physical attackers.
- Low Speed hurts it.
- It is weak to common offensive types, namely Fire and Ground. Furthermore, Earthquake, the most common physical Ground-type attack, doesn't activate King's Shield's Attack-dropping effect.
- It is reliant on King's Shield to go into Shield forme, which can be taken advantage of.

########
name: SubToxic
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: King's Shield
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Substitute
ability: Stance Change
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 244 HP / 252 SpA / 12 Spe

Moves
========
- King's Shield helps Toxic stall, cripple physical attackers, and revert to Shield Stance after attacking.
- Shadow Ball is your main source of damage, while also dealing good enough damage to most Steel-types, making sure that they can't switch in for free to block Toxic.
- Toxic cripples many of Aegislash's common switch-ins, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Mandibuzz, Hippowdon, and Zapdos, and can lure and cripple Defog users.
- Substitute stalls for Toxic damage and protects from status.
- Sacred Sword and Iron Head can be used over Substitute for coverage purposes.

Set Details
========
- Obvious spread
- Max Speed + Timid instead of Special Attack to avoid WoW from Rotom-W and Leech Seed from Mega Venusaur with Sub, outspeed any BD Azumarill, and is also useful to outspeed and OHKO Adamant Bisharp with Sacred Sword if you are using it. Also, outspeeding stuff like Landorus-T and defensive Excadrill can come handy.

Usage Tips
========
- This set is a great tank, wallbreaker, and staller.
- If the opponent's best answers to Aegislash are susceptible to Toxic, use it as they switch in; otherwise, spam Shadow Ball. 
- Use Substitute whenever needed either to avoid status moves or help Toxic stall the opponent.

Team Options
========
- Wish support is helpful to keep Aegislash healthy. All the good Wish passers have great synergy with Aegislash, so pick whichever you like more.
- Pokemon to cover its defensive weaknesses are important.
- Pokemon that like bulky Ground-types weakened appreciate this Aegislash's support.

Tank
########
name: Tank
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Sacred Sword / Iron Head
move 3: Shadow Sneak / Iron Head
move 4: King's Shield
ability: Stance Change
item: Leftovers
nature: Quiet
evs: 244 HP / 252 SpA / 12 Spe

Moves
========
- Shadow Ball is the nuke of this set; everything else on the set is a means of assisting it.
- Sacred Sword covers Heatran, Excadrill, Tyranitar, Bisharp, Mega Lucario, Greninja, and Blissey.
- Iron Head takes care of most Fairy-types and 2HKOes Tyranitar.
- Shadow Sneak can be used over Sacred Sword or Iron Head, depending on your team's needs, and is useful for picking off frail offensive Pokemon and getting 2HKOed against Pokemon that siwtch into you when combined with Shadow Ball. - Shadow Sneak is also good to 2HKO Deoxys-S leads after hitting them with Shadow Ball.
- King's Shield is a must to be able to change formes reliably and check a ton of physical attackers.
- Toxic can be used for Mandibuzz, Chesnaught, specially defensive Hippowdon, and Zapdos.

Set Details
========
- The EV spread plays Aegislash to its strengths, making it a great tank that can take a lot of damage and hit back hard.
- 12 Spe EVs outrun Sassy 0 Speed Tyranitar
- Leftovers help Aegislash stay healthy, especially with King's Shield.
- SpA is maxed instead of Atk as Shadow Ball is the main source of damage, while the physical attacks do their job even with no investment. Also, a Quiet nature is used so that Aegislash's bulk or power is not jeapordized.
- Shadow Sneak + Iron Head + Sacred Sword + 252 Atk EVs + Adamant is an option if your team needs some strong priority and a way to get past bulky special walls easier (think Goodra and Chansey).

Usage Tips
========
- This set plays as a hit and run Pokemon, so make sure to bring it in whenever you can.
- Use King's Shield with caution, as it can give free switches to dangerous Pokemon or result in Pokemon that you thought were harmless getting free boosts (eg. The Azumarill you thought was locked into Waterfall using Belly Drum).
- If you see hard counters to Aegislash (specially defensive Hippowdon, Mandibuzz), you are better off double switching after bringing Aegislash in.

Team Options
========
- Use Pokemon that can deal with bulky Ground-types with this set, such as Rotom-W (which actually beats every single good switch-in to Aegislash) and Greninja.
- Mega Venusaur checks Rotom-W and most Ground-types.

Other Options
########
- Offensive Swords Dance can wallbreak.
- Autotomize can boost its Speed and sweep weakened teams.
- Metal Sound + Hidden Power Ground + Flash Cannon + Shadow Ball can bust through Skarmory, SpD Heatran, Mandibuzz, and a few others things that threaten Aegislash defensively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Ground-types**: Specially defensive Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Zygarde, Krookodile, Excadrill, Quagsire, and Landorus are all can handle Aegislash to some degree.

**Physically defensive walls**: Mandibuzz resists Shadow Ball and takes pittance from anything else. Heatran, Chesnaught (Bulletproof makes it immune to Shadow Ball), Rotom-W, and Zapdos all work.

**Offensive Pokemon with STAB super effective attacks**: Bisharp, Crawdaunt, Greninja, Hydreigon, Diggersby, and Fire-type attackers all threaten Aegislash greatly.
