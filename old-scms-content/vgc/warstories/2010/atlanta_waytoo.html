<p>i might be a smogon nobody but i showed up anyway seeing as its not that long a drive. i first started caring about the VGCs about a month ago when i heard there was a regional in my town this year. So i spent a week or so planning then another testing on a VGC server battle sim (under the Russian alias Wavtu) and finally i spent this week getting things ready in game.</p>

<p>Now the stuff you care about, the team:</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/195.png" alt="Quagsire" /><br />
Quagsire@Leftovers<br />
(Water Absorb)<br />
Bold 252 HP 252 SP Atk<br />
-Toxic<br />
-Recover<br />
-Protect<br />
-Icy Wind</p>

<p>it started as a kyogre check but then i added icy wind...<br />
it hits both opponents and lowers speed and best of all no one expected it</p>


<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/145.png" alt="Zapdos" /><br />
Zapdos@Charti Berry<br />
Bold...i forget but some big investment in bulkiness with a little speed<br />
-Discharge<br />
-Heat Wave<br />
-Detect<br />
-Roost</p>

<p>gets some synergy with quag, and after an icy wind or two alternating detect and roost can stall pretty well</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/150.png" alt="Mewtwo" /><br />
Mewtwo@Expert Belt<br />
Timid 252 Sp Atk 252 Spd<br />
-Grass Knot<br />
-Aura Sphere<br />
-Ice Beam<br />
-Protect</p>

<p>more or less what youd expect with protect</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/488.png" alt="Dialga" /><br />
Dialga@Sitrus Berry<br />
Modest 240HP 252 Sp Atk 16 Spd<br />
-Aura Sphere<br />
-Thunder<br />
-Flamethrower<br />
-Dragon Pulse</p>

<p>again almost standard with enough speed to beat other dialgas and a few slower things. sitrus helped me more than i thought with dialgas bulk</p>

<p>unfortunately i didnt save any battles...anyway here goes</p>

<p>Round 1: faced a casual player i talked to in line...nothing interesting<br />
4-0</p>

<p>Round 2: this guy seemed to know a bit more and i remember toxicroak and palkia. my team doesnt like toxicroaks but at some point it dawned on me that i had PP stalled him out of Sucker Punch and then i finished up<br />
3-0 i think</p>

<p>Round 3: so, remember one of the in-game trades where you can get a kadabra? i think it was named Kazza and i think my round 3 opponent was using it. so he led with psychic...and followed next turn with..psybeam?<br />
4-0</p>

<p>Round 4:another palkia-kyogre team (man these things are popular) luck smiled on me because at one point i got frozen...and then thawed next turn<br />
3-0</p>

<p>so i was the last finalist to qualify partly because i was in the back of the line and partly because this team is less offensively inclined. after a short break we were on to the finals</p>

<p>Finals Round 1: this was a matt (mattj?) and he wasnt bad zapdos got a paralyze that helped and saw another palkia<br />
3-0 again</p>

<p>Finals Round 2: anoooother palkia-kyogre team from what i remember the important key part was when mewtwo who already had taken a hit survived an ice shard to KO palkia when it was 2-2<br />
2-0</p>

<p>Finals Round 3: palkia-kyogre (sensing a theme?) the difference being me not switching quagsire when i shouldve and taking a grass knot early on, without that things were against me and things went downhill from there on<br />
this was the son of the father son duo (the Arnold family?)<br />
0-2</p>

<p>im quite happy for a first VGC and may go to the nationals, i havent decided yet. it was pretty fun because 3 of my battles were on the screens and at some point someone was hosting the japanese movie arceus on wireless and i snagged one before the VGC people shut it down<br />
gg everybody</p>

<p>PS you may have seen me, i was the white guy with the fro and metroid shirt </p>
