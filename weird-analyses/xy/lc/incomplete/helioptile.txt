Moves
========
Volt Switch helps gain momentum for the team, in and out of sun. It can help safely bring in Chlorophyll users to sweep or Vulpix to set up sun.
Thunderbolt is Helioptile’s strongest option in sun, and gives it a chance to sweep when the opponent is weakened.
Dark Pulse is Helioptile’s strongest coverage move, hitting Misdreavus for super effective damage.
Hidden Power Fire gives Helioptile near-perfect coverage (only Deino not hit neutrally). It is boosted by sun (which is essential given its low base power) and hits Grass-types hard.
Hidden Power Grass is also an option to hit incoming Chinchou and Ground-types, while Hidden Power Ice hits Ground- and Grass-types.
Set Details
========
Although Helioptile has decent speed, a Choice Scarf is necessary because of Helioptile’s lousy defenses. It also doesn’t mind being locked onto a move much because of Volt Switch and its lack of good secondary options.
The listed EV spread maximizes Special Attack and Speed. The remaining EVs are used to boost Helioptile’s defenses.
A Modest nature is recommended because Helioptile needs all the extra power it can get, but with a Timid nature, Helioptile outspeeds Carvanha after a Speed Boost.
Solar Power recoil means Helioptile can’t really take any hits.
Usage Tips
========
Doesn’t hit as hard as other sun abusers (like Chlorophyll users/Charmander), so recklessly hurling off Thunderbolts is inadvisable.
It is best used early in the battle to deal some damage while maintaining momentum (which is usually difficult on sun teams) and to take out specific counters (Vullaby/Misdreavus).
When to bring it in: as opponent recovers HP (e.g. as Vullaby Roosts), on any Ghost move, Thunder Wave.
Very important to keep Vulpix healthy (which, to some extent, Helioptile helps you do), or have backup setters. Helioptile is very pedestrian outside of sun.
Can perform as a late game sweeper if opponent’s team is sufficiently weakened. Its Flying resistance is good for Fletchling’s priority Acrobatics (which gives Chlorophyll sweepers problems).
Team Options
========
Vulpix is the obvious teammate. It can set up sun for Helioptile, while Helioptile can help bring in Vulpix safely (which is particular important for Heat Rock and Choice Scarf variants).
Larvesta is another good teammate. It can set up Sunny Day and forms a VoltTurn combination with Helioptile.
Chlorophyll users like Oddish, Bulbasaur, and Bellsprout appreciate Helioptile’s ability to threaten Vullaby.
Archen, which carries a handy immunity to the Ground type attacks that threaten Helioptile, can use Defog to eliminate Stealth Rock for your team’s Fire-types (most notably Vulpix) or use Stealth Rock to wear down Vullaby. It also has U-turn, so it can form a VoltTurn combination with Helioptile if that is desirable.
Other Options
########
Surf is unfortunately weakened by sun, but is a good secondary option outside of sun.
Helioptile gets another solid ability in Dry Skin, which allows it to switch into Water attacks and threaten with STAB Thunderbolt/Volt Switch, but Dry Skin sets are outclassed by Chinchou.
Parabolic Charge is basically an Electric Giga Drain that could theoretically help offset Solar Power recoil, but it's far too weak.
Only LC Electric type to get Sandstorm, which could theoretically be useful since it threatens Water-types and has Volt Switch.
Glare is the best paralysis move in the game now, but with Gligar gone it's hardly better than Thunder Wave.
Too frail to use any of its support moves.
Gets Agility, Charge Beam, Rain Dance, Thunder, but outclassed by Chinchou.
Has some decent physical moves (Wild Charge, Rock Slide, Dragon Tail, weirdly U-turn), but horrible Attack.
Basically nothing else is really viable because defenses suck, speed isn’t awesome and special attack isn’t anything special outside of sun
Checks & Counters
########
Chinchou is the bane of Helioptile’s existence. Not only does it outclass Helioptile, but it also walls the hell out of it unless Helioptile carries Hidden Power Grass.
Bulky Normal-types like Munchlax, Lickitung, and Porygon can take any attack with relative ease.
Snover changes the weather and resists Helioptile's STAB. However, it must watch out for HP Fire.
Ground-types can switch in to prevent Helioptile from using Volt Switch. Diglett in particular can trap and KO Helioptile (as well as Vulpix).
Fighting-types can KO easily with STAB Fighting moves, although none of them enjoy switching into STAB Thunderbolt in sun. Timburr and Croagunk deserve special mention because they can switch in and hit with Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave.
Anything with priority can do a good chunk of damage to Helioptile before taking a hit.
