[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the power of all of the holder's damage-dealing Psychic-type attacks by 20%. If Mr. Mime breeds while holding Odd Incense, a Mime Jr. Egg will be produced as opposed to a Mr. Mime Egg.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Odd Incense is practically identical to TwistedSpoon, as they both boost Psychic-type moves by 20%. In any case, Odd Incense is not used much in competitive battles. It is often outclassed by items such as Choice Band and Choice Specs, which boost the power of physical and special moves by 1.5, respectively, and Life Orb, which boosts the power of all moves by 1.3. Although these three items do come with negative effects, it is generally better to use them over a Odd Incense.</p>
