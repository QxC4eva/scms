<h2>The Backdrop</h2>

<p>It's been a long fall from grace for the Stag  Beetle&mdash;it was once one of the most important Pokémon in DPPt  OU, but for the past year or so, Heracross has been desperately clinging  onto its OU status, hovering at about #47 in usage for quite a while.  Alas, in September the inevitable could no longer be delayed, and the OU  list did not have Heracross's name on it for the first time in Gen  4.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in UU, speculation had been rife for months about  Heracross. UU players had expected the drop for two metagames, some  players even more. At the time, UU had a stable metagame; however, this  wasn't to everyone's liking, and most people relished the prospect of a  metagame with Heracross. </p>

<h2>Heracross's Impact</h2>

<p>The greatest change that Heracross brought about was the  shifting of the metagame from balance-centric to being dominated by  offensive teams. Stall is now nearly non-existent on the ladder,  although some top-level players are continuing to use stall  teams.</p>

<p>Weezing usage had already been on the rise, once people  discovered that it made a great counter to Venusaur. After Heracross  came down, Weezing usage skyrocketed, since it is one of the few Pokémon  that can take two hits from Heracross and live. In August, Weezing was  29th in usage; it is reasonable to expect that it rose a few places in  September.</p>

<p>Arcanine has always been popular in UU, due to its superb  utility in checking various threats and posing a great threat itself.  However, its stock has never been higher than in this metagame.  Arcanine's Intimidate and STAB Flare Blitz are godsends to teams that  need a way to take care of Heracross, and Arcanine seems set to break  into the top 5.</p>

<p>In times of great danger, often ordinary people rise to the  occasion and do themselves proud; apparently, this happens with Pokémon  as well. In this case, the Pokémon that answered the call of duty is  Gligar. Gliscor is often called the best Heracross counter in the game;  its little brother Gligar does the job just as well. With great physical  defense, resistance to both of Heracross's STABs, and STAB Aerial Ace,  Gligar is capable of switching into any of Heracross's  moves&mdash;even a Guts-boosted Facade&mdash;and scare it out,  or KO it if it stays in. It also helps that Gligar has the same base  Speed as Heracross.</p>

<p>Scyther, considered the best Bug-type in the UU metagame before  Heracross showed up, has not suffered a drop in usage. In fact, UU  players (coughHeysupcough) have discovered that Scyther makes a great  teammate for Heracross, luring in Heracross's checks and using U-turn to  both deal damage and switch out to an appropriate counter, ensuring  that Heracross has an easier time later on.</p>

<p>One would expect Spiritomb usage to have decreased once  Heracross turned up. Heracross is strengthened by Will-O-Wisp, resistant  to Dark-type attacks, and doesn't take much from Shadow Sneak. Oh,  yeah, did I mention that Heracross can OHKO Spiritomb with Megahorn?  While Spiritomb's usage may have decreased a little, it shouldn't be too  drastic, especially when you consider that Spiritomb efficiently  Pursuits Rotom and Mismagius, allowing Heracross to spam Close Combat  without fear later in the game.</p>

<p>Heracross has certainly made its presence felt. Only time will tell if it overdid it.</p>

<h2>Analysis of Sets</h2>

<p>Heracross @ Toxic Orb<br />
Guts<br />
252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Megahorn<br />
- Facade<br />
- Night Slash</p>

<p>Status Orb Heracross is one of the best Heracross sets in the  metagame. The aim of this set is to activate Guts and then fire off  brutally powerful attacks. A powerful Facade is one of the best things  about the set, since it hits common switch-ins for large amounts of  damage&mdash;Moltres, Scyther, and Weezing all come to mind. This  set is really all about coming in and hurting things, sweeping be  damned. Heracross really appreciates Stealth Rock support, since a  Guts-boosted Megahorn can OHKO Rotom and Mismagius after Stealth Rock.  This is pretty important, as otherwise your opponent can try to play  around Heracross with clever switching, waiting for Toxic damage to  build up.</p>

<p>Weezing and Arcanine are as close as you will get to counters  for this set. Physically defensive Weezing takes 42% &ndash; 50%  from Facade, but considerably less from Heracross's other moves, and can  use Fire Blast to dent Heracross.</p>

<p>Heracross @ Choice Scarf<br />
Guts<br />
252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Megahorn<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Façade / Night Slash / Sleep Talk</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Heracross is not as great as other Heracross sets  against stall teams, but fortunately, with the inclusion of Heracross in  the tier, stall is now rarely found. This Heracross set takes advantage  of that fact as it is able to plow right through offensive teams late  game. It is able to outspeed everything in the tier save Electrode. The  best reason to use this set is its simplicity; all it really needs to do  is fire off Megahorn or Close Combat to scout for counters, then switch  out and wait until those counters are weakened enough that they won't  be able to come in. Guts is also very effective if Heracross can switch  in on Toxic or Will-O-Wisp, effectively giving it +1 Attack and Speed.  Stealth Rock is important for this Heracross as it doesn't deal as much  damage as the other sets, so it appreciates the entry hazards quite a  lot. Scyther and Moltres, who would otherwise counter this set, fail to  do so with Stealth Rock in play.</p>

<p>The best way to beat this set is through smart switching, which  is easier to do here than against other Heracross sets. Arcanine has  Intimidate and resists Megahorn. It can also take advantage of Close  Combat's Defense drop to threaten with an Extremespeed. Ghost Pokémon  such as Rotom, Spiritomb, and Mismagius can all switch in on Close  Combat, but all take massive damage from Megahorn. Weezing can switch in  on any attack and defeat Heracross.</p>

<p>Heracross @ Choice Band<br />
Guts<br />
252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Megahorn<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Façade / Night Slash / Sleep Talk</p>

<p>Unlike the Choice Scarf set, this definitely has the power to  break through stall teams while still remaining a threat to offensive  teams. If this switches in on a status move, then something is probably  getting knocked out. This is a great Pokémon that gets in, knocks  something out, then switches out for later use.</p>

<p>Examples of how strong this Heracross is:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>Guts Activated Megahorn vs 252 HP 252 Def Impish Spiritomb – (105.3% &ndash; 124.3%)</li>
<li>Guts Activated Close Combat vs 252 HP 252 Def Impish Arcanine  with Intimidate – (68% &ndash; 79.9%) 34% chance to OHKO with  Stealth Rock in play</li>
<li>Guts Activated Megahorn / Close Combat vs 252 HP 252 Def Bold  Weezing – (44.6% &ndash; 52.7%) 2HKO with Stealth Rock in  play</li>
<li>Guts Activiated Megahorn vs 4 HP 0 Def Modest Moltres – (39.8% &ndash; 46.9%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Without Choice Scarf, some Pokémon now outspeed Heracross and  can threaten it with a super effective attack. Moltres, Scyther, and  Arcanine can all switch in without Stealth Rock on the field and force a  switch. Weezing can force out Heracross when it hasn't activated Guts,  while Dugtrio can OHKO it with Aerial Ace.</p>

<p>Heracross @ Leftovers<br />
Guts<br />
252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Megahorn<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Substitute</p>

<p>Using Heracross with Substitute is like playing with a Choiced  Heracross but without having to predict. It is able to scout using  Substitute to see the initial switch-in, and respond accordingly after. It beats would-be  revenge killers such as Moltres and Dugtrio with ease. It doesn't hit  nearly as hard as the Choice Band set, so it has a bit of a problem with  stall. If it gets in safely against an offensive team, it can usually  nab a KO.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the advantages of this set is also its downfall  to an extent; Heracross loses valuable HP with no way to recover it.  Pairing it with a Pokémon capable of learning Wish is therefore of a  great benefit to this Heracross. As for counters, Weezing is probably  the best out there. Arcanine with Intimidate is an effective way to  check it. Gligar is an unusual but surprisingly effective counter as  well.</p>

<p>Heracross @ Life Orb<br />
Guts<br />
252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Megahorn<br />
- Sleep Talk<br />
- Rest</p>

<p>The RestTalk Heracross reaps the benefits of Choice Band  without being locked in on one attack, and the ability to recover HP is a  huge boon for Heracross. This comes at a price, however; the Guts  effect only lasts two turns and it cannot pick the correct attack  guaranteed. Maximum HP gives Heracross a surprising amount of bulk and  the ability to take on threats such as Weezing better. It is an  effective status absorber that can dish out pain at the same  time.</p>

<p>The drop in Speed doesn't affect Heracross too much, but  anything that resists its STAB attacks, such as Moltres, Scyther, and  Gligar,  can switch in without problems. Predicting a Rest and switching  in a Pokémon that can OHKO Heracross, such as Houndoom, is an effective  way of forcing it out as well. The unreliability of Sleep Talk is this  set's downfall, and can be taken advantage of.</p>

<h2>Argument for Banning</h2>

<p>Heracross has quite often been compared to Gallade, who was  banned from UU due to its ability to decimate stall teams and, at the  same time, hold its own against offensive teams. In fact, people have  argued that Megahorn, superior Speed, Guts, and the absence of the  detrimental  Psychic-typing make Heracross a better Pokémon than  Gallade, and therefore it should be banned immediately.</p>

<p>However, even if you ignore the fact that Heracross is similar  to Gallade, there's a lot of evidence that Heracross does the same  things just as well as Gallade, if not better. It can be shown by damage  calculations that Heracross is better at breaking stall than Gallade  (and everyone knows how good Gallade was at that), due to Guts and a  STAB Megahorn. The main question to be answered is: what can Heracross  do against offensive teams?</p>

<p>The answer is that it can do quite a bit. Scarf Heracross  outspeeds and heavily damages, if not OHKOes, most members of an  offensive team. Even a Choice Band or Life Orb Heracross can come in on  one of the slower members of an offensive team&mdash;Venusaur or  Sceptile after a drop from Leaf Storm, for example&mdash;and proceed  to unleash powerful Close Combats / Megahorns. Of course, Heracross is  dealt with far more easily as well, since Pokémon like Alakazam and  Swellow can force it out. But Heracross is nevertheless adept at netting  KOes against an offensive team.</p>

<p>At the end of it, Heracross doesn't really attempt to sweep.  Heracross is more of a wallbreaker, and by coming in, getting a KO,  switching out, and repeating it again and again, it shows us that maybe  it does deserve to be banned.</p>

<h2>Argument Against Banning</h2>

<p>Heracross is indeed a very powerful force in the metagame, but  not really any more threatening than other offensive Pokémon, such as  Torterra and Rhyperior. It does have a lot more Speed than those  Pokémon, but  unfortunately, it is sitting at an intermediate Speed  tier. Heracross outspeeds most walls but fails to outspeed the many  Pokémon that sit at base 80 if it runs an Adamant nature; if it goes  with a Jolly nature it loses a ton of attacking power.</p>

<p>Heracross also has no access to viable priority and no  Speed-raising moves. This severely hinders its sweeping ability,  practically forcing it to come in, get a good hit in, and then switch  out again. With the prevalence of Stealth Rock and Spikes in the  metagame, this becomes very taxing on Heracross, especially if it is  holding a Toxic/Flame/Life Orb.</p>

<p>The Bulk Up sets, while powerful, possess the same problem, in  that they can nab a KO well enough, but with so many powerful Fire and  Psychic attackers outspeeding Heracross and threatening a KO back,  Heracross cannot sweep very well at all. The Choice item sets can become  set-up bait and rely greatly on prediction to work. The RestTalk set is  underwhelming because it is not reliable enough to get the job done.  Heracross really suffers from having no means of reliable  recovery.</p>

<p>Players must keep Heracross in mind when building their teams  but that's no different than any other major threat such as Milotic and  Venusaur. It is a top-tier threat for sure, but it needs a lot of  support in order to be an effective tool in a team.</p>

<h2>As it Stands</h2>

<p>Heracross has been on the ladder for a while now, but due to  the transition from Shoddy Battle to Pokémon Lab, the testing period for  Heracross hasn't officially started yet. However, people have played  with and against it, and are trying out many different sets. Opinion on  Heracross is split very evenly, and Heracross might just remain in UU  for a while.</p>
