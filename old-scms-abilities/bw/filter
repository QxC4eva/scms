[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Whenever a super effective move is used on the wielder, the damage is decreased by 1/4. Basically, 2x effective attacks are treated as though they were 1.5x effective, and 4x effective attacks as if they were 3x effective.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Filter is a simple <a href="/bw/abilities/solid_rock">Solid Rock</a> clone, although its limited distribution holds it back. With Filter, the user takes decreased damage from super effective attacks, meaning that <a href="/bw/pokemon/mr_mime">Mr. Mime</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/mime_jr">Mime Jr.</a> are a bit harder to take down than normal with moves such as <a href="/bw/moves/pursuit">Pursuit</a>. Feel free to use Filter on one of Mr. Mime's offensive or <a href="/bw/moves/baton_pass">Baton Pass</a> sets if you dislike <a href="/bw/abilities/technician">Technician</a> or <a href="/bw/abilities/soundproof">Soundproof</a>, respectively.</p>
