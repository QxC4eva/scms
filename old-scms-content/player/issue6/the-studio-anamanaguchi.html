<p>If you are reading this article, then chances are you've played a video game before. Alright. Cool. So, assuming you've played a video game before, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that you've also experienced video game music. Obviously, there's some video game music that everyone knows (maybe except for the people who haven't played video games but are still reading this article; go play a video game). We all know the Mario theme, and, along with this, the unique blip-y sound that is used to create the melody. What if I told you that there's an entire genre centered around using these 8-bit sounds?</p>

    <p>Meet Anamanaguchi. Pioneers of this genre, called "chiptune," Anamanaguchi has captivated the ears of hundreds of thousands of people by combining chugging guitars, frantic drumming, and soaring melodies with the nostalgic blooping of video game music. Anamanaguchi is famous for using a hacked NES to generate these sounds, and the results are incredibly impressive. Anamanaguchi's sound is sugary, energetic, and just all-around good. While their earlier efforts stay closer to the sound of video game music, even doing the soundtrack for the game <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</em>, their latest record, <em>Endless Fantasy</em>, builds onto their already distinctive sound, adding elements of punk rock, J-pop, and cats meowing. I fell in love with this band a few weeks ago, and I haven't been able to stop listening. I've got a musical sweet tooth, and Anamanaguchi satisfies these cravings for feel-good, pump-up energy. Like last article, we'll leave you with five Anamanaguchi tracks that I personally think are important and showcase their unique sound.</p>

<h2>Anamanaguchi- Airbrushed</h2>

</div>
<p>Their breakthrough single, Airbrushed, is a prime example of all of the best qualities of Anamanaguchi's work. Frantic guitars and drums serve as a backdrop for a glowing 8-bit lead synth that drives the song, soaring in the chorus and filling up every empty sonic space.</p>



<h2>Anamanaguchi- Endless Fantasy</h2>

</div>
<p>More poppy than Airbrushed, Endless Fantasy is progressive, moving along and working off of a specific theme, without relying on a consistent chorus to return to. It starts off slow, and builds up to a euphoric beat drop, piling synths over similar, Anamanaguchi-style guitars. It's almost impossible for me to keep from nodding my head whenever this comes on.</p>



<h2>Anamanaguchi- Meow</h2>
<div class="video">

</div>
<p>I'm still not sure how I feel about this one. It definitely lets Anamanaguchi's personality shine through; they're known for goofiness and general shenanigans. The part that's conflicting to me is how the song is driven by a high-pitched "meow" sample. On the one hand, it's funny as hell; on the other hand, it's, well, annoying. But bold. The struggle. See for yourself what you think of it.</p>



<h2>Anamanaguchi- Pop It</h2>
<div class="video">
<iframe width="500" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/scmQ6iN8hKM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>The latest single that the band has released, Pop It actually deviates somewhat from their chiptune sound and forays into the world of dance pop. Cutesy female vocals chant and synths flare; vocals are manipulated and feet move. Pop It hits home and shows that Anamanaguchi is versatile in what they're able to do. I highly recommend this one for anyone who may not have enjoyed the previous tracks listed.</p>



<h2>Anamanaguchi- This is the End</h2>

    <p>As I mentioned before, Anamanaguchi did the soundtrack for the <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</em>e video game, and to close out this article, I thought it would be appropriate to end with the credits song from the game. This track is (gasp) pretty slow. Laden with nostalgia, it winds everything down very nicely. Perfect for riding off into the sunset, maybe in a speed boat, with a pretty girl and a glass of orange juice. I'm not sure where I'm going with this.</p>


<p>Once again, thanks for reading! Apologies for the hiatus this segment of The Player took - a combination of business and exhaustion kept things on hold for a while. I hope you'll tune in with me next time for some more music that might appeal to you, and which probably won't suck. Unless it does, for which I'd be deeply sorry. Peace!</p>
