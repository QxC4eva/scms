<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Psychic-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed during the damage calculation. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Psychic-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Payapa Berry is a type-resist Berry that reduces the damage taken from super effective Psychic-type moves by 50%. Since Psychic-type moves are rather uncommon in a metagame infested with Steel- and Dark-types, Payapa Berry will almost always be outclassed by another item. Toxicroak in particular might seem like a good candidate for a Payapa Berry, being 4x weak to Psychic, but due to its general frailty, it appreciates Leftovers to aid in its recovery in the rain, or an attack boosting item such as Choice Band, Choice Specs, or Life Orb to bolster its offenses.</p>
