<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts user's Special two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful boosting moves ever, RBY Amnesia. In one single turn, you are doubling your Pokemon's Special, meaning a it's both doubling its offense and defense on the special side. Using this move twice lets Mewtwo cap Special at 999, making it virtually unbeatable unless it critical hits and gives you a chance to paralyze it. The most notable OU users are Slowbro and Snorlax, who, paired with Rest, become defensive behemoths able to deal high chunks of damage. The best option to deal with Amnesia users is to use Explosion or Selfdestruct on them before it's too late, since both OU users won't mind getting paralyzed.</p>
