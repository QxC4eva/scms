<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The Smogon Live Tournaments are a weekly series of fun quick tournaments that focus around Nintendo's VGC rulesets, though that is not all that is played. For the January 2011 - March 2011 Season the metagames are 2009 VGC, 2010 VGC, 2011 VGC, and 6v6 OU.</p>
