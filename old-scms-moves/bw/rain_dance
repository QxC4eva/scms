[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This move generates the rain weather condition for five turns. Any weather condition previously on the field is removed. While this condition is active, all Water-type moves have their Base Power increased by 1.5x, and all Fire-type moves and SolarBeam have their power decreased by .5x. Synthesis, Moonlight, and Morning Sun will only recover 1/4 of a Pokemon's maximum health. The moves Thunder and Hurricane have their accuracy raised to 100%. Pokemon with the Dry Skin ability will regain 1/8 of their maximum health at the end of every turn. Pokemon with the Swift Swim ability double their Speed. Pokemon with the Rain Dish ability recover 1/16 of their maximum health at the end of every turn. Pokemon with the Hydration ability are cured of any status ailment immediately. If the user of this move holds the item Damp Rock, the duration of the weather becomes eight turns rather than five. Weather Ball becomes a Water-type move with 100 Base Power. Pokemon with the ability Forecast become Water-type. If Rain Dance is used while the rain weather condition is already active, the move will fail.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rain Dance summons rain, one of the most useful weather conditions in Pokemon. With rain in play, Water-type moves increase in power, and Pokemon such as Starmie can do tremendous damage to the opponent with their STAB attacks. Pokemon with the Dry Skin ability, most notably Toxicroak, recover 12.5% of their maximum health every turn, allowing them to set up Substitute freely. Rain Dance is also one of those moves that most Pokemon can learn even if they're not Water-type Pokemon. Additionally, Pokemon who can use Thunder, such as Rotom-W, can utilize the move while under effects of rain as it has 100% accuracy. Hurricane can also be utilized by Tornadus and Dragonite, for it also has 100% accuracy. While it is true to a certain extent that Rain Dance is obsolete because of the existence of Drizzle Politoed, there is a very good reason to use Rain Dance in standard OU instead, and that's Swift Swim. It is illegal to have a Pokemon with Swift Swim and a Pokemon with Drizzle on the same team in Smogon's standard OU; however, no such restriction applies to Rain Dance. Pokemon with Swift Swim can seriously exploit the effects of rain, because not only does it double the Pokemon's Speed, allowing it to outrun almost any Pokemon, but it also boosts their Water-type STAB moves through the roof, turning Pokemon like Kingdra and Kabutops into absolute monsters. Rain Dance is most easily set up by Prankster Tornadus, who can also capitalize on the rain with its STAB Hurricane.</p>
