<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the power of all of the holder's damage-dealing physical attacks by 10%.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Muscle Band is the physical equivalent of Wise Glasses, and can be pretty useful as an alternative to Life Orb which does not cause recoil. Even though it is a lot weaker than Life Orb—and yes, the difference in damage is significant—it boosts the damage of all your attacks, unlike Expert Belt, which occasionally will not boost them. Expert Belt is typically the favored item, as most Pokemon who want to be switching attacks will have enough coverage to make better use of Expert Belt, and most Pokemon who are relying on STAB attacks will want Life Orb or Choice Specs for the maximum possible power. Muscle Band is typically used less than Expert Belt both for attacking and for bluffing a Choice item, but the potential is there, if you want to risk it.</p>
