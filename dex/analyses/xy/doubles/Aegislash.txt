Overview
########

- A wonderful Ghost / Steel typing allows it to stop many, common Fighting-, Dragon-, Steel-, Bug-, and Fairy-types in the tier, as well as the majority of Trick Room setters in the tier
- Thanks to its ability Stance Change, it can effectively switch between dual 150 offenses and 60 / 150 / 150 defenses, giving it great bulk and offensive presence simultaneously and can attack from either side of the spectrum
- Access to Wide Guard allows it to block Heat Waves and Earthquakes that would otherwise ruin its day
- Low speed; this is actually more of a blessing because if it were to move first the opposition would then be able to hit its much weaker Blade Forme.
- Biggest problem it faces it the frequency of Fire-types in the tier; this means it will often need team support to handle threats like Charizard-Mega-Y and Heatran. Ground-, Dark-, and Ghost-type weaknesses don't help it out very much either

Wide Guard Tank
########
name: Wide Guard Tank
move 1: Wide Guard
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Flash Cannon
move 4: King's Shield
item: Sitrus Berry / Lum Berry
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Quiet

Moves
========
- Wide Guard allows Aegislash to block harmful spread attacks, which is especially useful when you consider that Aegislash's most common weaknesses will be in the form of spread attacks. It also allows it to support any teammates that hate spread attacks, such as Heatran.
- Shadow Ball provides a strong Ghost-type STAB, which is great because it hits everything except for Dark- and Normal-types at least neutrally.
- Flash Cannon is the other STAB move of choice, striking down Fairy-types like Togekiss for your teammates.
- King's Shield is a given on any Aegislash, reverting it back to Shield Forme while also blocking it from harmful attacks. Unfortunately it will not block status moves so be alert for Taunt, Thunder Wave, Spore, etc

Set Details
========
- Speed is minimized to help you move last, as Aegislash will tend to work best when it moves after both opponents. It also helps Aegislash counter opposing Trick Room, which thanks to its high offensive stats and prized Ghost-type STAB is a role Aegislash will often fill (i.e. Anti-TR)
- Sitrus Berry provides Aegislash with reliable recovery, utilizing Aegislash's Shield Form to turn many 2HKOs to 3HKOs
- A Lum Berry can be used to patch up King's Shield's weakness to status, specifically allowing Aegislash to donk annoying sleep inducers.

Usage Tips
========
- This set will typically be used to support other teammates with Wide Guard, protecting them from EQ, Heat Wave, Blizzard, Icy Wind, etc
- When Wide Guard isn't necessary, Aegislash fires off its STAB attacks do deal solid chunks of damage to the opponents.
- It will also typically be the way your team will be taking out Fairy-types, so you'll want to keep it alive if you see things like Togekiss in Team Preview
- It is generally a safe idea to use King's Shield when Aegislash is in its offensive form so it can take more attacks.
- Just because you can block Heat Waves and Earthquakes doesn't mean you are untouchable by Fire- and Ground-types. Things like Charizard-Mega-Y may run Overheat to avoid Wide Guard so you'll need to be cautious when around them.

Team Options
========
- Usually you'll be using this set when your teammates are in need of Wide Guard support.
- One of the big partners is Heatran, as it can usually easily get up a Substitute when Aegislash is blocking Earthquakes with Wide Guard. From there Aegislash can either continue to protect the pair from Earthquake or proceed to attack alongside Heatran
- Terrakion is another good ally, as it can eliminate Dark- and Normal-types for Aegislash while Aegislash eliminates Fairy-types for Terrakion and can guard Terrakion from Earthquake and Muddy Water. Several other Fighting-types like Breloom, Virizion, Conkeldurr, and so forth work alongside Aegislash similarly
- Charizard(-Mega-Y) and Landorus-T also appreciate this set's support so they don't have to worry about respective Rock Slides and Icy Wind/Blizzards (Lando-T can also use EQ while Aegi uses Wide Guard which is useful). The pair of Charizard-Mega-Y and Aegislash tends to have trouble with Heatran though, so be aware of that.

Offensive Pivot
########
name: Offensive Pivot
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Flash Cannon
move 3: Shadow Sneak / Sacred Sword / Substitute
move 4: King's Shield
item: Weakness Policy / Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpA
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Quiet

Moves
========
- Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon provide Aegislash with two solid, reliable STAB attacks.
- Shadow Sneak allows Aegislash to pick off threats that have accumulated much damage. It can get pretty terrifying after a Weakness Policy Boost.
- Sacred Sword allows Aegislash to hit Bisharp, who otherwise can walk all over this set, and hurts specially bulky Pokemon, such as Assault Vest Pokemon, a wee bit harder.
- Substitute can be used to take advantage of the switches Aegislash forces, granting Aegislash protection from status (that King's Shield doesn't) as well as more offensive leverage.
- King's Shield converts Aegislash back to its Shield Form after attacking (granting it much more bulk), ruins physical attackers, stalls field conditions, scouts for attacks, and messes up offensive strategies.

Set Comments:
========
- The EVs and IVs lower Aegislash's Speed so it can reliably check Trick Room teams or it can thrive in one itself.
- Weakness Policy takes advantage of Aegislash's fantastic bulk in Shield Form, easily sponging a hit and then retaliating with +2 STAB attacks in its Attack Form. If Aegislash is using Shadow Sneak or Sacred Sword, this is the preferable item.
- If Aegislash is using Substitute, Leftovers is a great item choice due to the amount of survivability King's Shield+Substitute brings. Also, if Substitute is being used, the 4 Attack EVs should be put into either Defense of Special Defense.

Usage Tips
========
- Bait in attackers with super effective hits to activate Weakness Policy. Non STAB super effective coverage is perfect, such as random Knock Off's and Earthquakes.
- However, Aegislash can only comfortably take one STAB super effective attack in Shield Form, so timing is important.
- Getting up Trick Room is really helpful early game because it eases prediction and keeps momentum on Aegislash's side.
- It is common to rotate between and attack and King's Shield so its frailer Attack Form is rarely exposed.
- It works decently if Trick Room isn't up thanks to its bulk and Shadow Sneak.
- If Aegislash is using Leftovers, just use its typing and bulk to switch in on helpless Pokemon, set up Substitutes, and spam its STAB attacks as its heart desires.

Team Options
========
- This set really loves Trick Room support, because it turns Aegislash into a ridiculously fast monster after acquiring +2 offensive boosts. However, Aromatisse is one of the few viable Trick Room setters that doesn't share a Ghost- or Dark-type weakness. Teambuilding will have to compensate for double weaknesses, but other great Trick Room setters are Cresselia, Gourgeist, and Chandelure.
- If Aegislash isn't using Sacred Sword, Mach Punch partners such as Conkeldurr (Trick Room buddy <:) or Breloom are appreciated to reliably counter Bisharp.
- Hitmontop offers Intimidate and Fake Out support and can protect Aegislash from lethal Heat Waves and Earthquakes with Wide Guard.
- Outside of Trick Room, Terrakion can take all of the Dark-type attacks aimed at Aegislash as well as threaten popular Heat Wave users such as Charizard Y and Heatran.
- Bulky Water-types such as Slowking and Milotic function well in Trick Room and can threaten the Fire- and Ground-types aiming at Aegislash.

Other Options
########

- Spooky Plate lets Shadow Ball net some important 2HKOs/OHKOs that couldn't be achieved otherwise and is more reliable than Weakness Policy
- While Aegislash can theoretically run a full physical set with Shadow Claw and Sacred Sword, this is not preferred due to the abundance of Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate in the current metagame
- Swords Dance works alongside Aegislash's natural bulk, allowing it to potentially snag a +2 Attack boost. However, practice has proven this ineffective due to the prevalence of Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp in the metagame, as well as the fact that a +2 Shadow Sneak will not be OHKOing much outside of frail Psychic-types (Latios) and Ghost-types (Gengar)
- Gyro Ball is an option and generally hits hard since Aegislash is so slow. Iron Head tends to be more consistent, however
- Reflect can be used if your team really hates physical attackers
- Rock Slide is an option if you have a huge grudge against Talonflame and Charizard-Mega-Y
- HP Ice to lure Landorus-T
- Air Balloon to switch into Earthquakes.
- Rest w/ Chesto Berry can be used for recovery. Aegislash struggles to find room for such an option in its moveset, unfortunately.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive-Type Advantages**

- Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Excadrill, and others can sponge an attack switching in while threatening it with their STAB attacks. They tend to have a bit of trouble doing much against the Wide Guard set, however.
- Fire-types like Talonflame (who must worry about King's Shield as well), Charizard-Mega-Y, and Heatran can also switch in and threaten Aegislash. Charizard-Mega-Y will have trouble with the Wide Guard set if it only has Heat Wave, as will Heatran though it can still fall back on Earth Power to hit Aegislash.
- Finally, Ghost- and Dark-types such as Scrafty and Mega Gengar check Aegislash, though they will need to watch out for Sacred Sword /Shadow Ball, respectively
- If Aegislash packs Sacred Sword switching in on it will require either skilled prediction or something with a lot of bulk that isn't weak to Ghost- and Fighting-type moves, such as Suicune (maybe Rotom-W but it will still take quite a bit from Shadow Claw/Shadow Ball)
- If it runs a Steel-type move instead it is easier to switch in on and handle defensively. Bisharp can come in on either move and doesn't care about King's Shield's Attack drop thanks to Defiant. Other Dark-types not named Tyranitar also do a pretty good job. Bulky Water-types like Suicune (again) and Gyarados (especially if it has Mega Evolved) also handle it pretty well
- Knock Off is common coverage that cripples Aegislash. At least it activates Weakness Policy!

**Utility**

- Taunt in general can prevent Aegislash from reverting back to Shield Forme and using Substitute or Wide Guard, which is useful.
- Encore is good to expose King's Shield, Wide Guard, and Substitute as well.
- Tanks with Assault Vest usually have an easy time against Aegislash

**Status**

- Spore and Thunder Wave do a decent job at stopping Aegislash, since it cannot block those respective moves with King's Shield. Since most Aegislash will be Special Attackers Will-O-Wisp isn't as affective as the other two options
