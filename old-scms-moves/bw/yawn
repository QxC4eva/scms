Puts the target to sleep after 2 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Causes one adjacent target to fall asleep at the end of the next turn. If the target is still on the field and does not have a major status problem at that time, it falls asleep, and this effect cannot be prevented by Safeguard or Substitute. Yawn will fail immediately if the target is already behind a Substitute when the move is used. If the opponent falls asleep through some means other than Yawn, and then wakes up, Yawn's effect will put the target to sleep again at the end of the following turn. Fails if the target cannot fall asleep or if it already has a major status problem. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p> 

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Yawn's greatest perk is its ability to force switches; as such, it works very well with entry hazard support—your opponent will be forced to choose between switching and taking damage, or having one of their Pokémon falling asleep. Yawn has a decent distribution, as well. It should be noted that if a Pokemon falls asleep (due to any other method) while being affected by Yawn and wakes up before Yawn takes place, then it will fall asleep again. This means that ChestoRest Kingdra among others is not entirely safe.</p>
