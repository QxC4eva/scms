<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>Before battling your opponent, make sure to follow these rules:</p>

<ul class="long_list">
<li>All matches must be played on Pokemon Showdown! or Pokemon Online (if you are playing ADV).</li>
<li>All battles will be standard XY OU, BW2 OU, DPP OU or ADV OU.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to use Pokémon, abilities, ability combinations, moves, or items classified as "Uber."</li>
<li>All tiers are based on Smogon tiers. The current status of the appropriate standard ladder will function as the prevailing tier list.</li> 
<li>Species Clause: A player cannot have two of the same Pokémon on their team. For example, a player cannot have two Koffing on his or her team.</li>
<li>Sleep Clause: A player cannot put two or more different opposing Pokémon to sleep using attacks that induce sleep to opposing Pokémon.</li>
<li>Evasion Clause: A player cannot increase their Pokémon's evasion stat with a move that specifically increases evasion. Items or indirect boosts do not break this clause.</li>
<li>OHKO Clause: Players cannot use moves that have a chance of instantly KO opposing Pokémon. For example, Horn Drill is an illegal move to have on a Pokémon's move set.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi Clause: Team preview must be turned on when playing BW2 OU and XY OU.</li>
<li>Moody Clause: No Pokémon using the Moody ability may be used.</li>
<li>If a battle ends in a draw, a rematch will occur with the option for both players to change teams.</li>
<li>Timed Battle must be enabled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Violating these rules will earn a loss for your team and may result in you being banned from all future World Cups.</p>
