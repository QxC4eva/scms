Overview
########

- Talonflame's main niche in Doubles revolves around its ability Gale Wings which grants priority to its Flying-type attacks.
- Priority STAB Brave Bird makes Talonflame a fantastic revenge killer. The ability to perform well as a revenge killer inside almost every Speed strategy in Doubles including Trick Room, Swift Swim, Chlorophyll, and Tailwind just makes it even more fantastic.
- STAB Flare Blitz and good Speed let Talonflame keep offensive pressure against even more of the metagame.
- It has a cool movepool outside of its STAB attacks, including U-turn, Tailwind, Roost, and Will-O-Wisp.
- Sadly, Talonflame's defenses are not good and its Attack stat is lower than average. This means that many threats can take a hit and KO back. Intimidate, which is common in Doubles, only adds to Talonflame's offensive burdens.
- Both of Talonflame's STAB attacks have large recoil damage, so combined with its defenses, Talonflame isn't going to last long.

item: Life Orb / Choice Band
evs: 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
- Brave Bird is a high-powered, priority STAB attack that deals a solid chunk of damage.
- Flare Blitz is another high-powered STAB attack that allows Talonflame to hit Steel-types that wall Brave Bird super effectively as well as hitting Electric-types harder.
- U-turn allows Talonflame to keep momentum against the opponents team while getting rid of Attack drops from Intimidate (which attract to Talonflame like no other).
- Tailwind is also a great move that allows Talonflame to support the team. Because of Gale Wings, Tailwind is +1 priority, so Talonflame is almost guaranteed to set it up.
- Protect is commonplace in Doubles; it allows Talonflame to scout attacks, block Fake Out, stall field conditions, and mess up offensive strategies.

Set Details
========
- Adamant is preferred over Jolly because Talonflame's Attack stat is lower than average, so it needs all the power it can get. It is faster than most threats it may want to Flare Blitz or U-turn against, anyway. The only perks for Jolly and 252 Speed EVs are outspeeding Choice Scarf Tyranitar and beating other Adamant Talonflame.
- The current spread outspeeds Thundurus-I and below.
- Going off of the first point, Talonflame needs all of the power it can get. Life Orb is the most reliable item because of the increased damage output.
- Talonflame works well with a Choice Band also as it allows Talonflame to KO many more Pokemon. However, being locked in any move is risky business in Doubles.
- Will-O-Wisp allows Talonflame to check threats that it cannot take out with its STABs, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Tyranitar. But, they are still able to KO Talonflame anyway, so it shouldn't rely on Will-O-Wisp unless it has nothing better to do against the team.

Usage Tips
========
- Talonflame's main job is to revenge kill, coming in to KO fast threats to the team.
- Because Brave Bird is priority, it is typically the main STAB Talonflame uses. Flare Blitz should only be used against Steel- and Electric-type Pokemon.
- U-turn is great early game so Talonflame's team can keep momentum. If Talonflame is using a Choice Band, especially, U-turn is the primary attack of choice.
- If an attack doesn't KO, it is wise to switch out or use U-turn (depending on how fast the threat is) and let partners do more damage first.
- Later in game, if Talonflame has Tailwind and the opponent has a lot of offensive pressure against you, it is wise to sacrifice Talonflame and set up Tailwind because it immediately switches the momentum to Talonflame's side of the field.

Team Options
========
- Talonflame needs teammates such as Venusaur, Amoonguss, Trevenant, and Breloom that can handle Rotom-W and other bulky Water-types.
- Teammates that can eliminate Landorus-T quickly really help, such as Mamoswine, Weavile, Suicune, and Rotom-W, so Talonflame doesn't have to constantly switch out to avoid the Attack drop.
- Bisharp makes it really hard for Intimidate users to switch in on Talonflame, and it really enjoys Tailwind. Other partners that love Tailwind include Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Heracross.
- Rock-type Pokemon wall Talonflame's STAB attacks and can easily take it out, so teammates such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, Hitmontop, and Conkeldurr make great partners in that regard.
- Feint partners such as Hitmontop and Mega Pinsir allow Talonflame to hit through Protect and Quick Guard, two moves that easily stop Talonflame.
- Wide Guard support from partners such as Hitmontop and Aegislash protect Talonflame from threatening attacks such as Rock Slide and Discharge.

Other Options
########

- With a Shuca Berry and Natural Gift, Talonflame can do a lot of damage to Heatran, who completely walls Talonflame otherwise.
- Substitute can allow Talonflame to take advantage of the many switches it forces, but residual damage is already a pain in its rear.
- A Sitrus Berry can make up for some of Talonflame's residual damage, but it's usually not enough health to make much of a difference.
- Acrobatics can be used with a Berry to activate the power boost, or by being itemless, to avoid residual damage. The power loss still stinks, though.
if the recoil damage is too bothersome, Sharp Beak is a reliable substitute, considering Brave Bird is the attack Talonflame uses most of the time.
- Swords Dance can also be used over U-turn / Tailwind to make Talonflame more of a win condition. However, it finds a hard time setting up, its STAB attacks are walled by Rock-types, and the utility of U-turn / Tailwind is much more consistent.
- Quick Guard is an option to beat Fake Out and to support its team against priority attackers.
- Taunt can be used to support its teammates against strategies such as Trick Room, Tailwind, and Sleep. However, Talonflame itself doesn't need it so much.

Checks and Counters
########

**Intimidate**

A weakened Attack stat severely cripples Talonflame, leaving its offensive supporting capabilities to be near useless. Intimidate users that can switch into Talonflame remotely easily include Landorus-T, Gyarados, Salamence, and Mega Manectric.

**Offensive Typing Advantage**:

- Rock-types, such as Tyranitar and Rhyperior wall Talonflame's STAB attacks and can easily KO with their own. Scarf Tyranitar can also surprise Adamant Talonflame by outspeeding and KOing with Rock Slide while it tries to U-turn out.
- Electric-types resist Brave Bird and threaten Talonflame with their STAB attacks. Mega Manectric can outspeed and it weakens Talonflame's Attack with Intimidate. Rotom-W and Rotom-H resist both STAB attacks and can KO with Thunderbolt. Scarfed Electric-types can also surprise Talonflame attempting to U-turn out.
- Heatran completely walls Talonflame and can set up Substitutes easily.
- In general, many bulkier Pokemon can take a hit and do enough damage to take out Talonflame, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and Garchomp.

**Opposing Weather**

- Politoed in particular threatens Talonflame because it can easily take a Brave Bird and KO with a Water-type STAB. Rain also weakens Talonflame's STAB Flare Blitz.

**Utility Moves**

- Fake Out really hurts Talonflame, because every bit of residual damage adds up. Mega Kangaskhan in particular makes a great Talonflame revenge killer.
- Quick Guard completely ruins any Brave Bird strategy, allowing a teammate to take Talonflame out. Popular users include Terrakion, Keldeo, and Machamp.
