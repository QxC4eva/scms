<h3>Current Events</h3>
<h4>Posted by Jukain on <strong>August 17, 2013</strong></h4>

<p>This week has been quite eventful in the OverUsed forum. Get the scoop on the latest events and discussions below!</p>

<p><a href="/forums/threads/looking-ahead-to-gen-vi-mark-ii-megapokemon.3487182/"><strong>Looking Ahead to Gen VI Mark II</strong></a> has been opened thanks to <a href="/forums/members/gcschris.171429/">GSCChris</a> with a spin on the old version&mdash;there will now be a focus each week! Originally created as a place for competitive X&amp;Y discussion and speculation, the thread will now be given a topic with some confirmed aspects for an engaging and insightful discussion. The first topic is <strong>Mega Pokemon</strong>, which are basically evolved formes of normal Pokemon that have a similar design but increased stats, different abilities, and sometimes even different typings! They evolve when holding a species-specific Mega Stone through an in-battle command, after which they can use their attacks. You can only have one Mega Evolution occur each battle. This all means enhanced strategic play and a surge of NU Pokemon like the new Steel/Fairy Mawile with Pure Power and increased defenses as well as a Dragon/Electric Ampharos. Don't miss a beat&mdash;participate!</p>

<p><a href="/forums/members/c05ta.42544/">C05ta</a>, <a href="/forums/members/soul-fly.174191/">Soul Fly</a>, and <a href="/forums/members/xknightx.74826/">XKnightX</a> have all advanced to the finals of the <a href="/forums/threads/3486030/">sixth OU mini-tournament</a>. Mini-tournaments are basically standard tournaments that are contained all in one thread and have a twist on the normal banlist. This time around, the auto-weather abilities, including Drizzle, Drought, Sand Stream, and Snow Warning; VoltTurn, or U-turn and Volt Switch; and Stealth Rock were all banned. C05ta has already lost to XKnightX&mdash;who will win? Best of luck to the three in a round robin-style finals!</p>

<p>The <a href="/forums/threads/3486297/">OU Community-Create-A-Team</a> aims to create a viable team for the OverUsed tier via community submissions and voting. Specially defensive Rotom-W was just selected for the team, and the fourth round of submissions has begun! Great work, everyone who has participated.</p>

<p>Rounding out this week's Current Events we have <a href="/forums/threads/the-ss-class-warstory.3487282/">The SS-Class Warstory</a>, a warstory by <a href="/forums/members/scotti.191872/">scotti</a> and <a href="/forums/members/subject-18.137683/">Subject 18</a>, has been posted! It features a bulky offensive rain team with a Kabutops on scotti's end and a weatherless offensive team on Subject 18's. Filled with thoughtful plays and predictions, it comes down to the wire at the end with Subject 18, barely hanging on after Kabutops's rampage, smartly switching around his Forretress and Terrakion, cleaning house with his Choice Band Terrakion. The commentary by both players makes the warstory exciting to read. Be sure to give it a read and post your thoughts&mdash;you won't be disappointed!</p>

<p>That wraps up this edition of current events. See you next week!</p>

<h3>Keldeo is Now a Suspect</h3>
<h4>Posted by Jukain on <strong>August 14, 2013</strong></h4>

<p>To anyone who has been following the OverUsed forum lately, or more specifically has even taken a peek inside <a href="/forums/threads/keldeo-evaluating-a-potential-suspect-test.3486689/">this thread</a>, it should come as no surprise that it is Keldeo's turn on the chopping block. That's right, Keldeo is Round 12's suspect! Before we reconsider Landorus's ban, it's going to get its second turn in the spotlight, and judging by the opinions of many players, might even get banned. Back in January when Tornadus-T was banned, Keldeo was also a suspect. It wasn't really given any attention though, as it lacked the gargantuan Speed and Regenerator of the dastardly kacaw. Now, it is finally going to receive everyone's attention, being at the forefront of the discussion. <a href="/forums/threads/np-bw-ou-suspect-testing-round-12-keldeo.3487169/"><strong>This thread</strong></a> will contain all of the discussion about whether or not Keldeo is really bad enough to be banned. You have until <strong>September 2<sup>nd</sup></strong> to achieve a rating of <strong>2000 Glicko2</strong> with a <strong>60 deviation</strong> on both of the <strong>OU suspect and current ladders</strong>. Participate in a suspect test that will determine whether one of the metagame's top threats is here to stay or will be booted out&mdash;vote on Keldeo!</p>

<h3>The Future of Suspect Testing: Identifying a Design Philosophy</h3>
<h4>Posted by Jukain on <strong>August 13, 2013</strong></h4>

<p>Any avid player of Smogon's tiers knows about the suspect testing system. Pokemon suspected of negatively impacting the metagame in some way are discussed and put up to a vote that will decide whether they stay in OU or are banished to Ubers. Participation in these votes is given by laddering to a certain ranking and deviation, and casting votes in four separate suspect tests nets you the Tiering Contributor badge, which is show in your postbit and grants various privileges.</p>

<p>If you participate in the np threads, or threads that discuss the brokenness and non-brokenness of the suspect at hand, you will notice that drama quickly ensues. Players of all skill levels approach the suspect from various angles with conflicting philosophies. This makes it difficult to determine anything truly conclusive about the suspect. The <strong><a href="/forums/threads/identifying-a-design-philosophy.3487083/">Identifying a Design Philosophy</a></strong> thread, posted by <a href="/forums/members/crux.39278/">Crux</a>, aims to alleviate this issue. Players of various pedigrees are often on one camp or another&mdash;can a Pokemon be strategically handled in a reasonable way, or can it be tactically handled in a reasonable way? The outcome of the consensus decided by this thread will help <strong>determine the future of suspecting testing in X&amp;Y and generations to come</strong>. Make your opinion heard and help shape the next generation of competitive Pokemon!</p>

Alkinesthetase is a great overall presence who is active, knowledgeable, and willing to help out (not to mention one of the most friendly people you'll ever meet), while Jimbon brings in his experience as a team rater to give people meaningful and in-depth conjectures on the OU metagame. ganj4lF was one of the best posters in <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3470573">Counter This Pokemon</a> and is continuing his streak of excellent in other projects. Check out their posts to see exactly what we're looking for in Overused, and make sure to send them your congratulations!</p>
