<h2>The Trip</h2>
<p>I left for San Mateo Friday 14th around 10pm so i was asleep most of the 8 hour trip. We arrived at my cousins house around 5 am I couldnt go to bed anymore so i just let my mom and uncle get some rest while i filled out my team info sheet and helped my brother test his team. we had breakfast and left around 10:30am. the 40 min trip to San Mateo felt long since i was soo excited. my uncles navigator or direction thingy got us lost and couldnt find the place for a good 20-30 mins so when we did find it we got inline towards the end. my brother and I met a nice kid named miles while waiting he was cool but sadly not a great player</p>

<p>Finally the line started to move and about 1:40pm i was registered</p>

<h3>Round 1</h3>
<p>I was sent to box 15 and was paired against my brother but we didnt want that now did we so we explained and i was sent back to the line to wait for another matchup. So my new matchup was agaisnt a kid who was behind me in line when i arrived and all he could talk about is how much his palkia and metagross were going to own :\ So Before i began I asked the ref if i could record my battles since i had my camcorder he called over marriland and he said "no." and explained why and was like okay w/e. So I led with my rain and he led with Metagross + Infernape seemed legit to me but I ended up KOing both with water spout then he sent out Palkia + another pokemon idk who which were taken out with surf and water spout So 1st round was a breeze</p>

<h3>Round 2</h3>
<p>I was paired up with another little dude but this one knew how to play. We both led with rain him with kyogre and toxicroak he knew what was going to happen he saw fake out coming but wasnt prepared for what i did over fake out i Grass knoted his Ogre and Thundered his Toxicroak, next turn I grass knoted what was left of Toxi and Thundered Ogre he came out with Palkia and Someone else (iforgetwho) I send in a grass knot and protect Ogre he spacial rends Ludi and it gets knocked out. I send out Tina to Shadow force his other pokemon and Thunder his Palkia with ogre his Palkia was Scarfed but missed spacial rend on Tina(phew) a shadow sneak and water spout later I won.</p>

<h3>Round 3</h3>
<p>I was paired with a large/older fellow kinda intimidating at first and was messing with his pokemon quite a bit so I knew i was in for a battle
well we both Led with Rain again! He led with Ogre + Milotic I decided not to fake out again and go for grass knot on Ogre and thunder on milotic well before the thunder hit his Milotic used hypnosis :O but missed dodged a bullet there and i got Para Hax :D next turn I surf and Water Spout to KO and he then sends out Dragonite + ???I keep thinking its Mewtwo but i dont remember. Well soon enough its down to dragonite and he Dragon Dances one turn then KO's Ogre I win later with a shadow sneak and Surf</p>

<h3>Round 4</h3>
<p>I was paired up with a fellow member on the TPT forums who that friday asked for a giratina :O this felt bad I already knew he was a good player but to battle him in this round was like WUUUT! So we shake hands and agree we would have a rematch on the forums whoever wins :) So for the 3rd time its Rain battle He leads with Ogre and palkia(i think) I begin by my last tactics of Grass knot early and thundered his other pokemon he pridected the thunder on his ogre to quickly switch over to E-Vire but it only got Grass knoted (phew) I got paraHax on his other pokemon. I Grass Knot and water spout to take out them out but he managed to get a t-punch in but wacan berry keeps me alive :D his last 2 with ogre and ???(bad memory too much excitement) I won with Ludi and Gira out and we shaked hands and GG all around</p>

<p>MADE IT TO THE FINALISTS LOUNGE yeah!</p>

<p>so while im there i do notice Huy, duy and other smogonites but im wayyy to intimidated to talk to them since im like a nobody i barely have rep for the Wifi forums</p>

<p>so a few battles and an hour later the top 29 people are sent to their battle stations and i got paired against Deagle</p>

<h3>Finalists Round 1</h3>
<p>Deagle led with Toxicroak + Palkia I led with my usual two and I can already see he was expecting Rain somewhere along the way</p>

<p>First turn<br />
I Protect Ogre + Grass Knot Palkia<br />
Deagle: Fakes Out + Thunders Kyogre</p>

<p>Second Turn<br />

<p>Afterwords I had a chance to film the Duy Battles and Talk to Magickzzl and DarksoulSP and someone else i dont remember his smogon acc but his name was james Although i wanted to go further i was happy where i made it. It was awesome meeting all those people one of the few places where i can jump in a convo and know wtf im talking about yeah good times cant wait for next year </p>
