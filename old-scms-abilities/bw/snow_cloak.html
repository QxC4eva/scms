Evasion increases 25% in hail.

[LONG DESC] 
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If hail is the prevailing weather condition, the wielder gets a 25% evasion increase. In addition, if a non-Ice-type Pokemon has this ability, it will not take damage from hail.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>God, this ability can be annoying. Anyway, on hail teams, you can expect to see <a href="/bw/pokemon/froslass">Froslass</a>, who will have Snow Cloak. Along with <a href="/bw/items/brightpowder">BrightPowder</a>, this can allow Froslass to survive for longer than she ordinarily would, and thus can get up an extra layer of <a href="/bw/moves/spikes">Spikes</a> or another attack off. Other Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/mamoswine">Mamoswine</a> will have Snow Cloak too, though they won't necessarily be on a hail team, so you may not have to worry about Snow Cloak unless you are running it yourself.</p>

<p>On October 15th 2012, Snow Cloak was <a href="/forums/showpost.php?p=4428479&postcount=83">voted to be banned</a> from Smogon's OU metagame as well as all tiers below it, so is currently unusable in all Smogon metagames bar Ubers and Little Cup.</p>
