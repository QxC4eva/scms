Overview
########

- With access to Fake Out, Wide Guard, Feint and many more support options he seems to be made for doubles
- Intimidate is a fantastic ability
- Although 90/110 defenses are great, his bad HP prevents him from tanking many hits
- Fighting isn't exactly the best defensive typing out there
- Outisde of the unreliable Sucker Punch, Hitmontop has no way of dealing with Ghost types and Psychic types

Utility
########
Name: Utility
Move 1: Fake Out
Move 2: Close Combat
Move 3: Wide Guard / Quick Guard
Move 4: Feint / Detect / Sucker Punch
Ability: Intimidate
Item: Sitrus Berry
EVs: 252 HP / 136 Atk / 60 Def / 60 SpD
Nature: Adamant

Moves
========

- This set maximizes Hitmontop's utility, being able to disrupt, tank hits and hit back
- Fake Out is invaluable for disrupting the opposing team
- Close Combat is Hitmontop's strongest and most reliable STAB, hits common threats like Heatran and Tyranitar for huge damage
- Wide Guard protects Hitmontop and his ally from dangerous spread moves, which are everywhere in doubles
- Quick Guard is a viable alternative if your team struggles with priority users like Talonflame
- Feint is perfect for breaking Protect and with +2 priority, it's great for picking off opponents with a few % HP left
- Sucker Punch forms better coverage with Close Combat and hits harder, but it doesn't break Protect and is slightly unreliable

Set details
========

- 252 EVs in HP and 60 EVs in Defense and Special Defense are there to ensure that he's never 2HKO'd by 0 SpA Cresselia's Psyshock or Psychic and to make him bulky enough to tank a few hits
- The rest of the EVs is dumped in Attack for extra damage output
- A more offensive spread of 124 HP / 252 Atk / 132 Spe is viable, as it outruns Rotom-W and hits harder, but Hitmontop usually prefers the bulk
- Sitrus Berry helps Hitmontop in recovering some health, which is always useful
- Will-o-Wisp is commonplace, so Lum Berry is an alternative

Usage Tips
========

- Hitmontop is an excellent Pokemon to lead with, as he pairs well with a lot of common leads like Mega Kangaskhan, who can together form a double Fake Out core
- Hitmontop hates to be burned, so Will-o-Wisp users must be removed early on
- Ghost pokemon are especially annoying, as they don't really care about anything Hitmontop throws at them and commonly carry Will-o-Wisp
- Use Close Combat with care: Once his defenses have dropped, Hitmontop can't take hits well at all anymore and prefers to switch out
- Fake Out is great for stopping non-Ghost Trick Room setters

Team Options
========

- Hitmontop fits on nearly any team due to the massive amount of support he provides
- Pokemon who appreciate his Wide Guard like Charizard-Y, Heatran and Scizor all love to pair up with this guy
- Pokemon with powerful spread moves like Mega-Gardevoir like the Fake Out and Feint support, as it allows them to sweep without the fear of being cockblocked by faster opponents or Protect spam
- Hitmontop is very self-sufficient so he doesn't need much support himself. As long as his teammates takes care of Cresselia and Ghost-types, he performs excellently

Other Options
########

- Helping Hand is an excellent move if you can find the room for it, as Hitmontop's common partners tend to carry strong spread moves that love a boost
- Stone Edge can be used to catch Flying-types off-guard
- An Assault Vest set with Fake Out / Close Combat / Stone Edge / Feint or Sucker Punch is a cool option, although it faces competition from Scrafty, who trades power for durability and more diverse utility for a Dark STAB move in Knock Off
- A gimmicky offensive set with Life Orb and Technician can be used with his plethora of priority attacks, but it doesn't hit very hard still, and giving up Intimidate usually isn't worth it
- Rest in conjunction with Chesto Berry can increase Hitmontop's longevity, allowing him to support his team for a longer time, although finding room for it on Hitmontop's moveset can prove to be difficult
- Expert Belt can be used over Sitrus Berry to score a couple of important KOs, such as an OHKO on Heatran and a big chance of OHKOing Chople Tyranitar. Stone Edge pairs especially well with this item, as it gives a guaranteed OHKO and 2HKO on 4 HP Thundurus and Intimidate Salamence, respectively

Checks & Counters
########

**Attack Control**: 

Landorus-T and Gyarados can weaken Hitmontop with Intimidate and resist Close Combat. Will-o-Wisp cripples Hitmontop, Ghost-type users like Dusclops and Trevenant are especially dangerous, since Hitmontop can't do anything to them in return

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: 

Bulky Psychic-types and Fairy-types can easily switch into anything Hitmontop can throw at them and retaliate with a super-effective move. Togekiss deserves a special mention, as she not only 4x resists Fighting, but she can even redirect Hitmontop's Close Combat thanks to Follow Me, meaning that Hitmontop has no means of doing much useful while she's on the field. Much like Psychic-types, Flying-types can switch in safely because they resist Hitmontop's STAB and can threaten it with powerful moves. Notable examples include Talonflame (if Hitmontop lacks Quick Guard), Mega Pinsir and Mega Charizard-Y

**Utility Moves**: 

Taunt users such as Thundurus-I and Aerodactyl can prevent Hitmontop from using Wide Guard and Quick Guard and thus prevent him from doing his job successfully. Encore is an even better utility move to stop Hitmontop with, but it's really rare. Rage Powder users like Amoonguss and Volcarona can redirect its Close Combats, hindering Hitmontop's performance. Amoonguss can even put Hitmontop to sleep.
