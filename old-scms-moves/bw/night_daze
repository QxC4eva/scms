<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 40% chance to lower the target's accuracy by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Night Daze is an exclusive move to the Zoroark line. It's a decent STAB choice with reasonable Base Power and good (albeit not perfect) accuracy. Its added effect to lower the opponent's accuracy is just icing on the cake. When added with a Fighting-type attack such as Focus Blast it gives Zoroark almost perfect neutral coverage on the whole UU tier. However, should the imperfect accuracy be seen as a detriment, Dark Pulse is usually chosen as the safer option, especially if the slightly higher Base Power is not needed.</p>
