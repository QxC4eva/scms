After each turn, the wielder may receive the Berry it used at a 50% chance (100% if in sun).

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At the end of each turn, the wielder has a 50% chance to receive a Berry that it had already consumed. If sun is the prevailing weather condition, Harvest will always activate at the end of the turn. If Harvest restores a Berry at the end of the turn, the Berry can activate immediately if the requirements are met (for example, if the restored Berry was a <a href="/bw/items/sitrus_berry">Sitrus Berry</a> and the wielder is below 50% HP at the end of the turn, it will activate). Harvest will only activate once per turn. If a Berry is removed via <a href="/bw/moves/bug_bite">Bug Bite</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/incinerate">Incinerate</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/knock_off">Knock Off</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/pluck">Pluck</a>, or taken by the effect of <a href="/bw/abilities/pickup">Pickup</a>, the Berry cannot be regenerated.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While having a 100% success rate in the sun sounds tempting, it is important to note that using Harvest means <a href="/bw/pokemon/tropius">Tropius</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/exeggutor">Exeggutor</a> will lose <a href="/bw/abilities/chlorophyll">Chlorophyll</a>, which has a more useful effect. As well as this, very few Berries outside of <a href="/bw/items/chesto_berry">Chesto</a> and <a href="/bw/items/lum_berry">Lum</a> will have any decent effects worth recycling.</p>
