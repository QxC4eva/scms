<p>To apply to be a tutor, you must send a Private Message to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=21476">Limitless</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=79509">Ojama</a>, and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=19420">Plus</a> with the following information:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Pokemon Showdown Nick:</strong></p>

<p><strong>References:</strong> These people should be well known community members who can vouch for your Pokemon skills and personality.</p>

<p><strong>"Write-Up for why you should be a Tutor."</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>An example application would be as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Pokemon Showdown Nick:</strong> Aeolus</p>
<p><strong>Time Zone:</strong> Central</p>
<p><strong>Tiers:</strong> DPP OU / BW OU</p>
<p><strong>Regular Online Hours (in EST):</strong> 2:00pm - 7:00pm</p>
<p><strong>References:</strong> Bloo, Setsuna.</p>
<p>I think I'd be a great fit for the tutor program because I've devoted my life for the past several months to studying the intricacies of competitive Pokemon as it has developed after the release of DPP. As such, I am extremely knowledgeable when it comes to team-building strategies and battling tactics. Additionally, I am an extremely affable person and I get along well with everyone I meet. People recognize my expertise, respect my knowledge and look to me for advice and direction. Further, I've been looking for a way to contribute to this excellent community; this would be a great way for me to do so. Please consider me for a tutor position!</p></blockquote>
