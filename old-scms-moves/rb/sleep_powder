<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Puts the target to sleep.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sleep Powder, despite its imperfect accuracy, is a great competitive move and one of the best sleep inducing moves. Sleep is arguably the best status in the game, practically eliminating a Pokemon from the match. Once Sleep Powder hits, Venusaur can easily set-up Swords Dance to start the Body Slam party or Exeggutor lets a stronger Pokemon get a free switch in. Exeggutor is one of the main OU sleep leads, using this move to great results.</p>
