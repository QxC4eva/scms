<li><a href="/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=149"><strong>The Ubers Analyses Forum</strong></a> is the place to go for writing analyses. You may reserve an analysis in the <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3468516">Index Thread</a> or comment on analyses that are a WIP.</li>

<li>Arceus has many formes&mdash;17 to be exact&mdash;but not all are given enough credit. <strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3481350">Arceus: Deity Of Underrated Sets</a></strong> project brings up Arceus's most obscure sets and forms to public recognition and explains how to use them, in order to give Arceus its much deserved credit.</li>

<li><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3466707">Project Ubers 2.0</a></strong> was brought up by Theorymon back in DPP, and was created to increase creativity in our static tier. This did not change when the fifth generation was released; Ubers is still a static tier, and Project Ubers gives creativity a shot. The sets in the project's database have been tested and are viable in the tier.</li>

<li>In the <strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3449887">Ubers Combination Thread</a></strong>, much like Ubers Teambuilding, we showcase and collect the tier's greatest combinations of Pokemon. If you want to build a new team and are looking for inspiration, this is the thread to go to!</li>

<li>The <strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3471695">Ubers Teambuilding</a></strong> thread assembles many of the tier's top-notch Pokemon and organizes them according to their roles so you can simply search the thread for a Pokemon that fits in your team!</li>

<li>Much like the Ubers Teambuilding thread and the Ubers CCAT, <strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3483063">Team Study</a></strong> showcases Ubers' best teams provided by Ubers' most skilled battlers, in order to bring up discussion and improve the teambuilding skills of the Ubers battlers.</li>

<li><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3473976">The Ubers Viability Ranking Thread</a></strong> asks to rank Ubers' common Pokemon, be it from Kyogre up in S-Rank to Shedinja in E-Rank, every Pokemon that you find viable in Ubers should be listed. If the Pokemon in your mind is not listed&mdash;feel free to bring it up to discussion!</li>

<li><strong><a href="/forums/threads/the-ubers-role-comparison-project.3484561/">The Ubers Role Comparison Project</a></strong> compares and contrasts duos or trios of viable Pokemon in the metagame that have similar roles. If you are trying to decide which sweeper should you use&mdash;like Rayquaza or Arceus, or which wall should you use, this thread is just for you!</li>

<h2>Recall</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3472091">TUberline Bridge [Done]</a></strong> is a special place where five notable Ubers battlers are ready to take you on during your journey to become the Holder of the Rainbow Tuber! Beat all five in order and you shall win the title!</li>

<li><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3465982">Counter That Uber Pokemon Teambuilder</a></strong> is no ordinary teambuilder. The goal of this thread is to build two teams that are supposed to do nothing but beat the other when both are revealed!</li>

<li><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3463225">Teambats</a></strong> are basically small, live tournaments, that involve two teams and a special rule of teambuilding. Both teams have a specific amount of time to build their team, and when that time is gone, to the battlefield they go!</li>

<li>Many people find it hard to build an Ubers team. Thus, the <strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3462087">Ubers CCAT2</a></strong> can be helpful! CCAT is an acronym for Community Create-A-Team, which, like the name suggests, is a team made by the entire Ubers community! In this specific CCAT, we have a special rule: we may not use any form of entry hazard support.</li>
