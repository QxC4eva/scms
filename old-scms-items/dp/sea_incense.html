Raises power of Water-type moves 20%.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises the power of Water-type moves 20% when this item is held.</p>

<p>If Marill holds Sea Incense while breeding, an Azurill Egg is created.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Although a 20% boost sounds good when coupled with STAB, few Pokemon are able to use Sea Incense effectively. Even those whose analyses mention its clone (<a href="/dp/items/wave_incense">Wave Incense</a>)&mdash;Floatzel and Empoleon&mdash;hardly ever hold it. This is because there aren't many movesets that focus primarily on Water-type attacks. Most Pokemon would be better off getting their power boosts from more conventional items, such as Life Orb or Choice items. These items boost all of the attacks in a moveset instead of just attacks of one type, making them superior choices over Sea Incense.</p>
