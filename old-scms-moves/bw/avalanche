[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of -4. Base Power doubles if the user was hit with an attack that would deal damage to it, even if zero damage was dealt after the attack hits, this turn other than Pain Split.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Avalanche is used primarily as a helpful coverage attack on tanks that care little about Speed. Users of Curse like Swampert, Tyranitar, or the occasional Rhyperior will be able to deal massive damage to the target after a Curse as they're nearly guaranteed to move last, and are dangerous enough that the opponent will almost always attack first. Beyond this niche however, Avalanche is rarely seen. The move has lost its TM status, which greatly hinders its distribution. Avalanche's -4 priority is also somewhat unwelcome as this prevents fast but frail sweepers from utilizing the move in a similar way to Payback. Still, Avalanche can prove itself to be very helpful if you find yourself with a slow attacker and an open moveslot.</p>
