<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to burn the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Lava Plume is an excellent move for defensive Fire-types, such as Heatran. The ability to burn the opponent while attacking is quite useful, as it can ward off physical threats such as Landorus, and deal additional residual damage to Fire resistant switch-ins. However, the move has low distribution, so one would more commonly see Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p>
