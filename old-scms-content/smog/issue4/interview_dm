<p><em>"You're seventeen, I'm not letting you in here."</em></p>
<p><em>"Really, I'm not here to drink, I'm here for an interview." I flashed the large bouncer a Koffing Pokemon card. "I was told to meet here."</em></p>
<p><em>"Sorry, kid, no dice. I'll have to ask you to leave&mdash;"</em></p>
<p><em>Suddenly a tall, handsome man who could only be described as the law-student version of James Bond appeared from behind the bouncer.</em></p>
<p><em>"He's with me," he said. His voice flowed more seductively than Edward's.</em></p>
<p><em>"Sorry, Mr. Lutalo." The bouncer quickly turned and let me in.</em></p>
<p><em>I walked in, sat down at the bar with a glass of hot chocolate in hand, and started interviewing DoomMullet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Okay, first off, could you introduce yourself and tell us a little about yourself?</p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: Sure thing. My name is Adam, better known as DoomMullet or DM (or Lutalo, if you count that failed experiment). I'm a 26-year-old law student at the University of Buffalo, living in the Buffalo, NY area.</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: On the note of Buffalo, I wanted to make a quick note &mdash; our normal interviewer Sarenji has been consumed by freshmen year at RIT, where I've been told you went.</p>
<p>How'd you like it there? Any words of wisdom for our fallen interviewer?</p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: Hmm, I suppose I have plenty, but unfortunately they wouldn't do him any good, he's already there!</p>
<p><em>In the distance, I can hear Sarenji groan as he finishes yet another Multimedia Project.</em></p>
<p>But seriously, it's a wonderful school and the name on the diploma carries a lot of weight. Sarenji's a real bright kid, so I'm sure he'll do very well. He just shouldn't expect much female interaction. At all.</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: He'll appreciate that! Anyway, how'd you come to Smogon? You've been here a while!</p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: Yeah, it's been... 5 years or so? Wow. I honestly just kinda fell into it. It's a VERY long story that I wrote in my 4k thread (in Greatest Hits), but long story short:</p>
<p>I was on a message board for a webcomic when some guy posted about another message board that needed members. It turned out to be the Uber boards, where I met Jumpman and some other notable Pokemon old schoolers.</p>
<p>From there, I ended up at Azure Heights and met more people, and then finally the spring after Smogon opened, I heard about it from Dweedle and joined up. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Well I can probably speak for everyone when we say we're glad to have you! Now Smogon is, at heart, a competitive Pokemon site. Have you ever played, or wanted to play, Pokemon?</p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: That's the funny part about me being in this community... I never played Pokemon, and yet became a big part of Smogon. Back in the summer of 2006 everyone kept hassling me about not playing, so I finally broke down and got a GameBoy emulator and a FireRed ROM.</p>
<p>I didn't get very far and eventually lost interest. I think not playing the game as a younger child probably had something to do with that: it just didn't hold the allure it does for everyone else.</p>
<p>But I did briefly get involved on NetBattle and had some fun with those randbats. My record was 7-42, so... yeah, I'm pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Yeah, randbats are probably the best thing about Pokemon... Back to what you said before about being here a while, do you have any specific fond memories or anecdotes about "old Smogon" that you'd like to share?</p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: Oh man, how much time do you have? The first thing that always comes to mind when I think about my early Smogon days is the summer of 2006. I didn't have a job and would stay up on IRC until 4:30am every night.</p>
<p>And then in August was JAA. Smogoners kept winning all the stops and getting trips to NYC, so Articuno64, Fish, and I went out there and met up with Jumpman16 and had the time of our lives for 5 days, meeting TONS of people.</p>
<p>That was the first Smocon, a tradition which we continued the next year in Toronto and then in Las Vegas in 2008. Unfortunately Arti and I had no money this summer so we were unable to put together a trip, but other people have been getting together, so I just hope that trend continues.</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: That does sound like a lot of fun. Maybe soon I'll be able to get to a Smocon myself!</p>
<p>Now we have a question from tennisace, who couldn't be here, "how bout dem bills"?</p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: Ugh.</p>
<p><em>DM's face transforms into a frown, his eyebrows furrow, but of course he is still impossibly beautiful. I scribble down, Note to self: punch tennisace.</em></p>
<p>Don't even get me started about that Pats game, I've seen that garbage ever since Jauron became coach. The whole "let them walk down the field while holding a late lead" thing is going to lead to me killing myself or others.</p>
<p>Trent Edwards, aka Captain Checkdown, can't throw more than ten yards down the field. Evans and TO are being wasted in this godforsaken offense.</p>
<p>The defense is so much better than the stats line says, it's just hard to give up less than 400 yards when you're on the field for 40 minutes!</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Heh sounds like you're a big sports fan. Are there any other sports/sports teams you really like.... or don't like?</p>
<p><em>Just then a young british boy, woodenman, wandered into the bar, looked at DM in awe, and ran off.</em></p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: I'm huge into the Buffalo Sabres as well. I was raised a Buffalo fan and I'll be diehard about the Bills and Sabres for the rest of my life. I do NOT like the Cowboys and Pats, because the teams always beat mine and their fans are arrogants a-holes.</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Do you like to play any sports in addition to watching them?</p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: I played lacrosse and football in high school, lots of roller hockey with my buddies, and also grew up playing in the town soccer league for 8 years. I really miss organized sports, because I love to get competitive and I feel like, looking back, I had a lot of untapped potential I never capitalized on.</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Sounds like fun (and you can always take up a sport later in life to blow off steam!!)</p>
<p>Now moving in a different direction... Anyone that pays attention to your posts, especially in Internet Renaissance, could see that you're very interested in music.</p>
<p>What facets of music interest you? (Writing, singing, playing instruments, listening, etc)</p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: I was raised in a very musical family. My two uncles and various cousins play guitar, one even in a band that was big in Buffalo back in the 90s. I picked up guitar myself and have been playing for about 10 years, and in the past few years I've been writing my own songs and recording them.</p>
<p>I just love the way music can be used to express emotions. That's why I listen to the music that I do: I feel that if the music doesn't move me internally, what's the point in listening to it? That's also why I avoid like the plague all the trite garbage on the radio and TV.</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Yea I can definitely see what you're saying. Do you plan to make any money off of your musical abilities?</p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: Not really. I've never written anything with anyone else in mind. If other people enjoy my music, I'm happy, but in the end I'm just doing it because I enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Sounds reasonable enough! Now you said you were a law student. What specifically do you want to do after law school?</p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: I worked at a firm in Rochester for the past two and a half years before starting law school. I would love to go back and work there; I've really put down roots in Rochester, I love the city and I really liked the people in that office. It's also a very large firm, and I'd be making some pretty sweet cash!</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Well that's always important.</p>
<p>Now the last question, most likely the most important. I know you said you don't play Pokemon, but you must have a favorite. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>DM</strong>: Hahaha, well, that's an easy question to answer. <strong><em>GOLBAT</em></strong>.</p>
<p><em>Somewhere deep in a cave, RB Golbat snickers.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Haha alright.</p>
<p>Well thank you for making time to get interviewed! You've been great.</p>
<p><em>As I leave the the bar, I think to myself. "How am I going to format this interview.... Maybe I can have it based in a bar. Yea, that's funny. Man, I miss Sarenji..."</em></p>
