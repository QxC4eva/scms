Moves
========
     
Fire Blast destroys everything while in a drought. Solar Power and the sun boost combined power up Fire Blast by 2.25x without need for setup. Nearly nothing is capable of switching into it and many bulky targets such as Kyurem-B, and Clefable can be OHKO'd. Dark Pulse confers useful neutral coverage, flinch chance, and  some nice and clean KOs on Fire-type resists such as Latias. Solar Beam is very useful for getting past Water-types and Rock-types such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Rotom-W that which otherwise check Houndoom. Destiny Bond is a useful fourth move that works well on Houndoom. It's fast enough to pull it off, succesful use retains momentum for the team, an important part of sun offense, and Houndoom is usually near death thanks to Solar Power recoil. Hidden Power Fighting is viable in the last slot only for Tyranitar, though it fails to achieve a 2HKO.

Set Details
========
     
Max Speed and Special attack optimize Houndoom's offensive ability. A Timid nature is used as without a boosting nature a large number of important Speed tiers are missed. Four Defense EVs as opposed to four HP gives more favorable hazard and solar power damage. Flash Fire is the ideal ability as the Flash Fire boost persists after mega evolution, and gives Houndoom a free switch in if played correctly
     
Usage Tips
========
     
With such power behind Fire Blast often resists to the move, even bulky ones such as mega Gyarados are cleanly 2HKO'd, there is no need to "overpredict". Trying to Solar Beam when an opposing Tyranitar or Politoed is alive and well is tantamount to suicide, don't do that. Houndoom is one of the best sun wall breakers, and as such it will be very valuable to your team. Destiny Bond should be used late game when the opponent's team has been weakened enough for other win conditions to be in sight. Destiny Bond can also be an early game backup solution to very important sun counters like Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Politoed should other ways of beating these Pokemon fail. Simply put this set is not functional outside of dedicated sun teams and should only be used there.
     
     
Team Options
========
     
Dugtrio is the most important, and nearly mandatory partner for Houndoom as beating Tyranitar and Heatran is incalculably valuable to Sun teams. In Tyranitar's presence, without Dugtrio Houndoom will be unable to scratch the opposing team. Chlorophyll Venusaur is a very, very useful partner being able to not only cleanly beat, but safely switch in on Houndoom's checks and counters such as Keldeo, Azumarill, and Breloom. Stealth Rock is a serious issue for Houndoom, and defog/rapid spin support is a fantastic option, Scizor performs this relatively well as it lures Will-o-wisp and offensive fire moves for HOundoom's flash fire, as well Scizor is a reasonable switch into one of Houndoom's best counters; Tyranitar. Excadrill is also a good partner to Houndoom, as in general it is a good Rapid Spin user to clear the field of rocks, and can attract some fire moves for Houndoom to gain a boost from. With rock slide, and a Choice Scarf Excadrill is capable of checking Talonflame as well. Latias is another excellent defogging partner being able to easy beat Keldeo, and switch in to WAter-type and Fighting-type attacks in general. Latias also has Healing Wish which can be used to give new life to Houndoom. Drought Ninetales with Heat Rock is what makes Sun viable, and as such it is a mandatory partner to Houndoom unless competent Heat Rock wielding Sunny Day users can take its place. With the Sun Houndoom is very, very strong. Without it, it is weak. Simple as that.
     
     
     
Other Options
########
     
Sucker Punch is Houndoom's only option for priority, and can mitigate issues against opposing priority and Choice Scarf users, though it is quite weak without investment. Will-O-Wisp screws with some switch ins, Tyranitar, Hippowdon, Azumarill and Terrakion most prominently, however some others like Heatran and Guts Conkeldurr can benefit from it. Sludge Bomb is a mildly useful move that can break through Azumarill without sun, and does the most damage to any fair. Flame Charge is an option, it lets Houndoom boost its speed to clean up late in the game.
     

Checks & Counters
########
     
**Strong Choice Scarf users **: Garchomp, Keldeo, Landorus-T, and Terrakion are easy checks to Hundoom if they have a Choice Scarf.

**Strong Priority Moves**:  Breloom, Conkeldurr, Talonflame, and Azumarill are a pain for Houndoom, they are easily capable of checking it.

**Tyranitar**: It replaces sun with sand, resists Houndoom's STAB moves, and has the bulk to take anything else while retaliating with Stone Edge. Tyranitar is Houndoom's biggest counter.

**Politoed** : Politoed replaces sun with rain and easily absorbs any of Houndooms attacks subsequently, answering with a boosted water move.

**Specially Defensive Hippowdon**: Again replacing weather is a bother for Houndoom as it relies on it to get past walls. Specially defensive Hippowdon avoids the 2HKO from Fire Blast and easily OHKOs with Earthquake.

**Blissey / Chansey**: These two sponge almost anything and cripple with status, however Sun Boost Fire Blasts can overwhelm them.
