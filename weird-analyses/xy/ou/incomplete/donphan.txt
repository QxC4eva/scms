
Overview
########

-Access to Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock
-Knock Off buff allows it to more easily threaten spin blockers
-Great 90/120 Physical Bulk
-Solid 120 Attack
-Resists the ever present Stealth Rock
-60 Special Defense leaves it vulnerable to almost any special attacker
-Assault Vest allows its Special Defense to reach a solid 328
-Slow base 50 Speed
-Lacks immunities to hazards unlike many other hazard removers
-No reliable recovery causes other walls to often outclass it
-Weak to now even more common Ice and Grass types
-Largely outclassed by other popular spinners in the current meta-game, especially on offense-based teams

Set 1: Leftovers
########
name: Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: Stone Edge/ Knock Off
ability: Sturdy
item: Leftovers
evs: 252HP/4Att/252Def
nature: Impish

Moves
========

-Rapid Spin is the reason Donphan is actually used so it's a must
-Earthquake is the mandatory stab and deals a decent amount of damage off of Donphan's Base 120 Attack
-Stealth Rock is one of the main draws of using Leftovers over Assault Vest
-Stone Edge creates the popular EdgeQuake combo and threatens many foes that would normally set up on Donphan
-Knock Off threatens any spin blockers not threatened by Earthquake (Gengar, Jellicent, etc.) and adds even more utility to the set

Set Details
========

-The EV spread and nature maximize physical bulk giving Donphan a lot of sustainability
-Leftovers adds to Donphan's sustainability and allows for more switch-ins
-Sturdy helps ensure that Donphan will get in at least one move, and is useful in situations where taking a strong special attack like Ice Beam then spinning is completely necessary
-Investment into attack is also an option if you want Donphan to fill more of a bulky attacker role and surprise opponents with a fairly potent STAB Earthquake but this detracts from Donphan's durability which is its main draw

Usage Tips
========

-Switch Donphan in on a physical attack
-Spin or use an attack against a predicted spin blocker, then spin
-Set up Stealth Rock if possible.
-Donphan can get the occasional KO but spin and run tactics are his main draw.

Team Options
========

-Usually added to teams that need a physically bulky spinner to aid sweepers
-Special walls help account for its abysmal Special Defense
-Anything weak to hazards (Charazard, Talonflame, etc.) benefits from its ability to control hazards
-Anything that resist its three weaknesses (Ice, Water, and Grass) helps
-Can also fit in somewhat well on a stall team if it runs Roar
-Donphan's low speed, average attack, and respectable bulk leave it better suited for defensive or balanced teams than offensive ones.

Set 2: Assault Vest
########
name: Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Sturdy
item: Assault Vest
evs: 252HP/4Att/252SDef
nature: Careful

Moves
========

-Again, Rapid Spin is Donphan's claim to fame so use it
-Earthquake is the mandatory stab and is a great counter to Aegislash on this set as Donphan can survive a Shadow Ball with Assault Vest and OHKO in return
-Stone Edge rounds off Donphan's coverage and allows it to OHKO Zard-Y as its Assault Vest set can eat a sun-boosted Solar Beam or Fire Blast
-Knock Off threatens any spin blockers not threatened by Earthquake (Gengar, Jellicent, etc.) and adds even more utility to the set


Set Details
========

-The EV spread and nature maximize special bulk to take full advantage of the Assault Vest
-Assault Vest allows Donphan to absorb special hits such as HP Ice from Thundurus-T, a Flash Cannon or Aura Sphere from Mega-Lucario, a Giga-Drain from +1 Volcarona , and even a Solar Beam or Fire Blast from Zard-Y. It tends to only be able to take one super effective hit, even with AV but can still check threats weak to EdgeQuake.
-Sturdy helps ensure that Donphan will get in at least one move, and is useful in situations where taking a strong super effective attack then spinning or using a super effective coverage move is completely necessary
-Investment into attack is also an option if you want Donphan to fill more of a bulky attacker role and surprise opponents with a fairly potent STAB Earthquake but this detracts from Donphan's durability which is its main draw

Usage Tips
========

-Switch Donphan in on a resisted attack if possible as it has no leftover recovery and less physical bulk
-Spin or use a coverage move against a predicted spin blocker then spin
-Set up Stealth Rock if possible.
-Donphan can get certain KOs with this set and due to his mixed bulk functions as a great lead

Team Options
========

-Usually added to teams that need a bulky spinner to aid sweepers
-Anything weak to hazards (Charazard, Talonflame, etc.) benefits from its ability to control hazards
-Anything that resist its three weaknesses (Ice, Water, and Grass) helps
-Donphan's low speed, average attack, and respectable bulk leave it better suited for defensive or balanced teams than offensive ones.

Other Options
########

-Ice Shard can sometimes net KOs on weakened foes and helps account for Donphan's abysmal speed. Only use this on a fully attack-invested Donphan.
-Head Smash can KO a number of threats the QuakeEdge combo can't with some attack investment, though the low accuracy makes it even more of a gamble than Stone Edge
-Can act as a decent phaser using Roar
-Can use Rock Slide over Stone Edge for better accuracy
-Toxic can be used to cripple a number of common switch-ins but is often inferior to Knock-Off

Checks & Counters
########

-Most Special Attackers, especially anything with Ice Beam and sometimes even Hidden Power Ice counter the Leftovers set
-Pokemon such as Rotom-W that aren't weak to the EdgeQuake combo and can easily KO in return
-Bulky water types
-Sweepers can easily break through the limited mixed bulk of Donphan's Assault Vest set, especially if they hit it on the switch or have Stealth Rock support to break sturdy
-Very strong Physical and Special attackers check Donphan, especially if they hit it on the switch
