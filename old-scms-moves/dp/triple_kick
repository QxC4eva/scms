[SHORT DESC]
Attacks up to 3 times in 1 turn.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Attacks up to 3 times in one turn. Has 10 power for the first kick, 20 power for the second, and 30 power for the third and final kick. Each kick has its own accuracy check, and the move ends as soon as one of the kicks misses. As it is technically 3 attacks in a single turn, rather than a single attack with up to 3 hits, Skill Link will not guarantee 3 hits.
