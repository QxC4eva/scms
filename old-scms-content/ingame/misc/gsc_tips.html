<h3><a name="gsc_cloning">The Cloning Glitch</a></h3>
 
<p>Go to a computer and save the game. Deposit the Pok&eacute;mon that you want to clone. Then change boxes, and during the stage where the message "Saving... Don't turn off the power." appears, soft reset your game. When you turn your game back on, the Pok&eacute;mon you deposited will be both in your box and in your party. Any items held by the Pok&eacute;mon will also be duplicated. Be very cautious when using this glitch, as it may result in the loss of saved data.</p>
 
<p>In order for this glitch to work on Crystal cartridges, you must reset when the game as soon as the last period of "Saving... Do not turn off the power." shows up.</p>
 
<h3><a name="starter_glitch">All three Starter Glitch</a></h3>
 
<p><strong>Note: Preforming this glitch will require an unsaved game file.</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
 
<ol>
<li>After going through the introductory information but before receiving a starter Pok&eacute;mon, save the game.</li>
<li>Without saving, progress through the game until it is possible to catch Pok&eacute;mon.</li>
<li>Catch any Pok&eacute;mon and travel to Cherrygrove City's Pok&eacute;center</li>
<li>Preform the <a href="#gsc_cloning">Cloning Glitch</a> on the starter, making sure not to save the game</li>
</ol>
<p>After completing the glitch, the player will be back at their save point before choosing their starter; however, the clone of their starter will still be stored in the PC. Simply repeat these steps with the other two starters to obtain all three.</p>
 
<h3><a name="celebi_glitch">The Celebi Glitch</a></h3>
 
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beat the Elite Four.</li>
<li>Have a Sneasel with the move Beat Up as its third move.</li>
<li>Have an unfilled box in Bill's PC with a Pok&eacute;mon that can be deleted in it.</li>
</ul>
 
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
 
<ol>
<li>Go to a PC and use the <a href="#gsc_cloning">Cloning Glitch</a> on Sneasel four times.</li>
<li>Incorrectly clone Sneasel once by shutting off the game when the "a" in "Saving... Don't turn off the power." appears (the chances of doing so correctly are fairly slim.</li>
<li>Place the original Sneasel in the first slot of your party followed by the four regular clones and the one glitched clone.</li>
<li>Go to the Pok&eacute;mon Daycare and deposit the glitched clone.</li>
<li>Immediately withdraw to glitched clone and place it in the first slot of your party.</li>
<li>Start the Daycare's computer and access Bill's PC.</li>
<li>Select "Move PKMN w/o Mail", choose the Pok&eacute;mon to be deleted, and place it in the first slot in your party.</li>
<li>Return to the Daycare man and redeposit the glitched clone that has been moved to the second party slot.</li>
<li>Restart the Daycare computer and deposit the four good clones and the Pok&eacute;mon to be deleted in Bill's PC.</li>
<li>Take back the bad clone and have the Daycare man raise the original Sneasel (if its name has changed, this is normal).</li>
</ol>
 
<p>Once you withdraw the original Sneasel it will turn into a Celebi; however, it will not be recorded in the Pok&eacute;dex and its level may be abnormally high. All other characteristics will be normal.</p>
 
<p>Note that the third and fourth Sneasel clones will also have their species changed, but their sprites will remain the same until they are deposited and withdrawn from the Daycare.</p>
 
<h2><a name="c_only">Crystal-Only Tips</a></h2>
 
<h3><a name="stones">Receiving Evolutionary Stones</a></h3>
 
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
 
<ul>
<li>Have the Daylight Savings Time (DST) feature turned on</li>
<li>Have the Pok&eacute;Gear</li>
<li>Record the stone-giving NPC's phone numbers in your contacts</li>
</ul>
 
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
 
<p>After meeting all of the prerequisites listed above, return to New Bark Town and talk to your mother. When she asks you if it is Daylight Savings Time, say "Yes" to change the clock by one hour. When the clock changes, you should get a phone call from a random contact in your Pok&eacute;Gear. If a stone-giving NPC does not call you, keep switching DST on and off until they do call. This can be done repeatedly as long as you pick up the item offered before trying again. Note that if changing the DST settings were to force the day to move forward or backward, your mother will simply say that she lost the instructions to the Pok&eacute;Gear and the time will not change. This is to prevent players from changing the day prematurely in order to activate time-sensitive events. Wait until after the next hour and try again.</p>
