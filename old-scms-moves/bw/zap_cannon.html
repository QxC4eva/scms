Paralyzes the target.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 100% chance to paralyze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Zap Cannon looks highly promising at first, sporting 120 Base Power and causing sure-fire paralysis; however, its accuracy is a huge letdown at only 50%, so that it's an effective coin flip as to whether it hits or not. As such, to use Zap Cannon to its fullest extent, one must patch up its accuracy. Ways to do this include holding Wide Lens or Zoom Lens, or using the move Gravity. Unfortunately, Galvantula, who has both Electric-type STAB and Compoundeyes, does not have access to Zap Cannon. Eelektross can also try to use Zap Cannon in tandem with Coil's accuracy-boosting effect.</p>
