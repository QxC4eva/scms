<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello! I'm posting my final RMT in the 4th Gen. Its only best if I post my favourite team in my favourite metagame of all time. I'm going to be straight up honest and say I didn't use this to peak #1 in the ladder, but I'm just sharing this anyways because its more interesting and less dull than the one I laddered with! And.. I'm too lazy for conclusions so I'll just say thank you uu people for giving me good matches outside of the ladder! also shoutout to M-BLADE</p>

<p>Judging from the title, you can already guess that this team is built around the monstrous sweeper known as Calm Mind Alakazam. How my team was constructed was a very simple thing I had in a hindsight. The formula was: 1 Alakazam lure + strong defensive core + Alakazam (lategame sweeper!). Mismagius was my main choice because it lured in Alakazam's counters from the get-go and it can either cripple them or hurt them p badly. A strong defensive core is required so I can only switch between 5 Pokemon instead of 6 - an unrevealed Alakazam is perhaps one of the best strategy at fooling your opponent from thinking you lack a strong offensive force. Let's face it, outside of Mismagius, my entire team is extremely shit from an offensive standpoint. Ultimately though, with everything scouted and removed (priority users + tomb mostly), I can sweep with ease for the most part.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Mismagius</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Will-o-Wisp</p>

<p>My lead of choice and a very simple one too - shut down Spiker leads, while dealing with the omnipresent pixies at the same time! We can thank that village idiot folgorio for accidentally discovering what a gem this set is. The simple premise is to shut down many leads by damaging them or either shutting down their attempts with Taunt. Will-O-Wisp makes quick damage to gutsy Spiritomb leads attempting to Pursuit her (which is the likely case). However, this is all part of my important strategy in a hindsight - scout out Alakazam's counters. With Mismagius luring in Spiritomb, it will either be weakened or restrained to a good extent with Will-O-Wisp.</p>

<p><strong>Milotic</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Marvel Scale<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Surf<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Hidden Power Grass<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>There's nothing new here and we absolutely love our underwater sea snake and her ability to cover nearly every single threat in the game! especially the dangerous Fire-types. Not many players enjoy using three attacks Milotic on a defensive set, but I simple enjoy using it to maintain a strong pressure on my opponent. Ice Beam is obviously the standout move in this set, it allows me to scare away Venusaur, Leafeon, and Sceptile instead of giving them a scot free switch-in! With this set, Milotic provides optimal coverage and can hit nearly everything for neutral damage.</p>

<p><strong>Weezing</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 240 SpD / 16 Spe <br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Sludge Bomb<br />
- Sleep Talk<br />
- Rest</p>

<p>Ever since I discovered the importance of this set, I have never turned back and I've been putting MiloWeez on every single team I have! no joke. It's a very promising defensive core in tandem with a "ghost-buster". Weezing's role is to bather out Venusaur from easily shredding my team to pieces. I need something that can switch into a Venusaur set and take Sleep, I mean sure, I can have Arcanine but I don't think it will enjoy Sludge Bomb at all. Will-O-Wisp and Sludge Bomb are my primary attacking moves. The 16 Speed EVs allow me to outpace 88 Spe Azumarill - a true son of a bitch of a Pokemon if Milotic is weakened.</p>

<p><strong>Arcanine</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Extremespeed<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- Morning Sun</p>

<p>To put the icing on the cake, I added Arcanine as a back-up check to Venusaur as well as checking random physical threats. Intimidate is such a nice ability in the game and it can really make sponging hits for my other walls easier! This is quite basic: Toxic predicted Milotic switch-ins because Torterra is oftentimes shaky due to its x4 weakness to Ice! Extremespeed provides useful priority to weakened Dragon Dance threats and such. Morning Sun obviously keeps Arcanine alive the entire match.</p>

<p><strong>Torterra</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Overgrow<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Synthesis<br />
- Wood Hammer<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>This is actually a pretty neat set and it is rarely used! Remember when I said that Milotic + Weezing core will only work wonders if paired in conjunction with a ghost-slayer? Well Torterra + Weezing + Milotic is actually one solid defensive unit and it allows me to check a super majority of the metagame. This means I don't have the reveal Alakazam at any point of the match at all! except for lategame where it should clean up. The spread allows me to survive onslaughts of Shadow Balls from Mismagius and Rotom. Outside that, Torterra is actually a solid Slowbro check and Milotic check without Ice Beam. Moveset wise, Earthquake and Wood Hammer are my primary attacking moves. Earthquake ensures that Fire-types don't switch in scot-free. Stealth Rock is obviously required for dealing easy twenty-five percents or sometimes 50!</p>

<p><strong>Alakazam</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Inner Focus<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- Grass Knot<br />
- Psychic</p>

<p> I present you the greatest sweeper of all-time! and an underrated one at that. Let's face it, Alakazam holds the key ingredients for fooding niggas: high Speed and monstrous Special Attack stat. Let's add Calm Mind to the mix and we have ourselves a motherfucking disaster. The team is built precisely around Alakazam and it involves switching in with my strong defensive unit without me having to reveal Alakazam at any point in the match. Once priority users and Spiritomb are removed from the match, the chances of victory on your side becomes very slim because like I said, nothing can really revenge it, and even Special Defensive juggernauts like Registeel can easily faint from +1 LO Focus Blast! Some common questions though: Where do you find time to set up? It's actually very easy, Milotic is my primary choice I can easily Calm Mind and take around 30 percent from Surf and from that point I can steamroll stuff with good coverage. Grass Knot deals with Tomb if needed and additionally allows me to hurt Specially defensive Milotic! That's just one Pokemon, I can find loads of more opportunities. Psychic + Focus Blast are pretty self explanatory. The only concern I have with this is Uxie completely walls this, and Mesprit to a lesser extent.</p>
