Raises power of Water-type moves 20%.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises the power of Water-type moves 20%.</p>

<p>If Mantine holds Wave Incense while breeding, a Mantyke Egg is created.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Although a 20% boost sounds good when coupled with STAB, few Pokemon are able to use Wave Incense effectively. This is because there aren't many movesets that focus primarily on Water-type attacks. Most Pokemon would be better off getting their power boosts from more conventional items, such as Life Orb or Choice items. These items boost all of the attacks in a moveset instead of just attacks of one type, making them superior choices over Wave Incense.</p>
