<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder's accuracy cannot be lowered. Keen Eye does not block the effects of <a href="/bw/moves/haze">Haze</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/heart_swap">Heart Swap</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Keen Eye is a poor ability as nobody uses accuracy reducing moves competitively. Therefore, the times that Keen Eye would even see use are very few. Always use a more consistent or reliable ability over Keen Eye.</p>
