- Such a shit poke
- Don't use it

Extreme Killer
########
name: Extreme Killer
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Shadow Claw / Shadow Force / Magic Coat
move 4: Earthquake / Magic Coat / Overheat
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb / Silk Scarf
nature: Adamant
evs: 240 HP / 252 Atk / 16 Spe

Moves
=========
- SD for power
- ES is for awesome priority
- Shadow Claw hits ghosts reliably, Shadow Force hits them hard as crap but is easy to play around
- EQ is best because it smashes Rockceus which is everywhere
- Magic Coat is epic as it reflects WoWs, Toxics and phazing
- Recover sucks don't use
- BB can be used for Ferrothorn but is shit weak otherwise, can also be used to hit Skarm, but Shadow Claw is almost as strong, and Shadow Force actually hits it way harder now.
- Overheat roasts Skarm in the sun, as well as (Mega) Scizor
- Return over a coverage for strong

Set Details
=========
- Such a shit set
- Weak as balls
- Totally not worth it
- But seriously, there really isn't much to say - SD combined with the strongest priority attack (Sucker Punch is balls) makes Ekiller a pretty good late game cleaner, as well as being able to revenge weakened sweepers
- Can revenge kill weakened sweepers
- EV spread lets you outspeed Adamant Rayquaza

Usage Tips
=========
- Don't use it
- Don't be a total dumbshit and bring out before turn 10 and attempt to sweep with it. That said, just because it's turn 11 doesn't mean bringing out Ekiller is going to automatically win you the game when its checks are still alive, you dumbass
- Lum Berry lets completely demolish all those ridiculous Defogging Rock Arceus's by pissing all over WoW and smashing the crap out of it with EQ followed by ES
- 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe Jolly @ Life Orb is probably the 2nd best spread if you don't like how piss weak you are with Lum - Rockceus needs to hit WoW AND win the speed tie to beat you, which is only a 42.5% for him
- Make sure you lure out its checks - Ekiller is actually a shit sweeper without everything busted open for him already

Team Options
=========
- Mega Gengar traps most of Ekiller's checks, apart from Giras
- SD Lum Groudon, Knock Off Blaziken, Calm Mind Kyogre with Ice Beam either severely weakens or outright kills Giras
- Ho-oh can come in on WoWs and phazing moves with virtual impunity if you can give it Defog/spin support
- Xerneas pairs pretty well with Ekiller, resisting Fighting moves and laughing at Giratina formes
- Darkrai also forces out Giratina and Lugia
- Mewtwo can also switch into Fighting moves directed at Ekiller
- Oh look Ekiller + Xerneas + Darkrai + Mewtwo + Groudon + Blaziken the biggest combo of misplayed Pokes ever
- Hazards are good if you're using Lum because it's shit weak, but is hard to keep up due to Defog and stuff like that.
- Sticky Web is fun to screw with offense even more by slowing down their revenge killers (eg Mega Gengar, Scarf Terrakion). Unfortunately, the only (semi)-viable Pokemon to set it up are Smeargle, Galvantula and (MAYBE) Ariados. If you are using Sticky Web, make sure you're using Jolly, since you don't want to slow down Terrakion and STILL get outsped, lol.


########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Extreme Speed
move 2: Trick
move 3: Shadow Claw / Shadow Force
move 4: Swords Dance / Earthquake
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 200 HP / 252 Atk / 56 Spe

Moves
=========
- ES is quite strong with ES - OHKOs Mega Blaziken after SR and about 5% prior damage, great revenge killer (Adamant CB is almost like adding an extra LO onto Jolly LO)
- Trick lets you cripple most of Ekiller's counters, eg Giratina, Lugia - be careful Tricking onto Ho-oh and Groudon though because they hit hard as fuck
- Shadow Claw hits Ghosts and in particular Mega Gengar, while Shadow Force for power but easier to play around, especially on a CB set
- SD lets you sweep after you cripple something with Trick, while EQ gives you better coverage
- Return can be used over Trick if you cbf using Trick

Set Details
=========
- Best set, I would have put number 1 if Ekiller wasn't so influential
- Not only is it strong without a boost (unlike Ekiller), allowing it to revenge kill a bunch of things but it can also cripple common counters with Trick
- Sacrifices a coverage move, which is a bit of a letdown, but the initial power and Trick are really nice to have

Usage Tips
=========
- Don't be too keen on Tricking CB and then attempting to play it like Ekiller - I know you fools would probably end up doing that
- CB plays very much like a Scarfer - revenge kills mid game and cleans late game, what sets it apart is (positively) ability to set up after Trick and being able to revenge kill priority users and (negatively) only one move being used to revenge kill things as well as crappy coverage


Team Options
=========
- CB is pretty self-sufficient, like most Scarfers are
- Pokemon that benefit from counters being Tricked Choice Band are good, eg Groudon, Blaziken, Terrakion


########
name: Wallceus
move 1: Will-O-Wisp
move 2: Recover
move 3: Return / Extreme Speed
move 4: Roar / Defog / Perish Song
item: Leftovers
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 200 Def / 56 Spe

Moves
=========
- WoW to fuck physical attackers
- Recover to stay healthy
- Return to inflict relatively good damage, although ES is pretty cool to revenge kill shit in an emergency (eg weakened Blaziken/Xerneas/Darkrai/etc)
- Roar is cool
- Defog is almost a staple on any defensive Arceuses these days
- Perish Song can fuck with last mons
- Shadow Claw or Earthquake can be used just so you don't get totally raped by Mega Gengar

Set Details
=========
- Good set, only Arceus set to be able to hold Leftovers
- Even more effective this gen due to Fighters being relatively meh this gen (exception of Blaziken, which has trouble sweeping with ES)
- Just send in this thing against physical attackers like Groudon, burn it and laugh at it
- Can take most unboosted hits anyway, so it's not a bad Poke to just pivot with
- Stone Edge to kill Ho-oh

Usage Tips
=========
- You are completely fucked against Mega Gengar unless you run something else like EQ or Shadow Claw, it'll just Taunt you and you can't do crap (if the Mega Gengar wanted to play around with its food, it could do that)
- Isn't much to say, just that it's a good idea that you're not using Defog to put another Defog user or a strong spinner since Wallceus is very much hazard fodder
- Can run a fast spread (252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe Jolly) to spread burns faster but you lose a lot of bulk
- Can run a specially defensive spread instead of physical, can easily take on stuff like Palkia and Xerneas (can Roar out a +2 Moonblast with relatively good health), can still burn physical attackers
- Don't be stupid and spam Perish Song when Mega Gengar is around


Team Options
=========
- Xerneas is a good switch into Fighting-types, so is Giratina(-O)
- Again, Defog works well if Wallceus doesn't carry it himself
- Heal Bell/Aromatherapy is nice to have to get rid of surprise Toxics/WoWs which really screws Wallceus - Xerneas is a good Aroma user that synergises well with Wallceus
- Special walls are good to use since Wallceus is mainly a physically bulky Pokemon - SpD Kyogre takes on shit like Reshiram pretty well, Gastrodon can beat SpecsOgre
- Needs something to take on Ho-oh, and since you don't have the ability to use Rockceus, you could use Heatran, as well as shit like Carbink and Rhyperior. Obviously keep SR up as much as possible


Other Options
=========
- Calm Mind - pointless
- Grass Knot for Groudon/Hippowdon
- Specs - CB does Choice Tricking better in general
- Work Up - what a shit move

Checks & Counters
=========
- This Poke is so shit that everything counters it :D
- Just note - I don't care how good the Poke may be in this metagame, I'm putting these Pokes in here as because they counter Arceus, nothing more, nothing less

- Ekiller may look incredibly intimidating, but one thing you really need to keep in mind is that it can't run everything at once
- In general, unboosted Arceus is a weak-ass fucker (LO is a bit stronger, but that comes with cost), which means it'll need to set up before it does anything remotely intimidating - never let it set up for free: hit it really hard with your powerful move, or get WoW/Toxic/Leech Seed onto it
- Even when boosted, it tends to not hit bulky Pokemon TOO hard. If it catches you on something like Scarf Thunder from Kyogre, go to your defensive wall and Dragon Tail/Roar it out, limit the amount of times that Ekiller can come in and set up
