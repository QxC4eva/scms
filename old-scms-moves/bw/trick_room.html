[SHORT DESC]
Slower Pokemon move first for 5 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When Trick Room is activated, normal Speed priority is reversed for the move's duration. So Pokemon who usually go last will go first. Using Trick Room while the effects are already active will cause the effects to cease. Trick Room has a priority of -7. If a Pokemon with Prankster uses Trick Room, it has a priority of -6. Under Trick Room, move priority of all moves remains the same, so a Scizor using Bullet Punch will always move before a Snorlax using Fire Punch. Any Pokemon with over 1809 Speed will be unaffected by Trick Room.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Trick Room is the centerpiece of an entire offensive playstyle, admittedly one that has gone out of favor, but can still present a credible threat. The basic idea behind it is to set up Trick Room with a bulky Pokemon such as Bronzong or Dusknoir, and then to tear apart the opponent's team with bulky, powerful, and slow sweepers such as Rhyperior, Snorlax, and Marowak. As these Pokemon are able to move first, they have a good chance to sweep; however, it takes quite an effort to set up Trick Room since it has a priority of -7, meaning it will almost always go last regardless of the user's Speed stat. While it is looked down upon in Standard OU for its short duration compared to other strategies such as weather offense, it is a common strategy in metagames where a few turns is all you need, such as VGC, where many teams are built around the move, and it is imperative to have some way to counter the strategy.</p>
