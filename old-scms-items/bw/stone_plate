[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that increases the Base Power of all Rock-type moves by 20%. When held by a Pokemon with the Multitype ability, the holder's type will change to Rock.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rock Arceus's main use is to act as a counter to Ho-Oh and Reshiram, a feat no other Pokemon can truly claim. Rock Arceus also receives a boost to its Special Defense in sandstorm, making it into quite the tank and a very capable sweeper with Calm Mind or Swords Dance. Unfortunately, Rock Arceus's common weaknesses to Water-, Grass-, Ground-, and Fighting-type attacks hold it back somewhat from being a common threat.</p>

<p>However, it is generally useless aside from Arceus, as most other Rock-types find the power boost from Stone Plate to be too menial.</p>

<h2>Location</h2> 
<p>Abyssal Ruins, 1F.</p>
