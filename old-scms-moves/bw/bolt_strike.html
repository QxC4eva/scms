<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 20% chance to paralyze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Bolt Strike is easily the best and most powerful physical Electric-type attack in the game. However, this move is restricted to three Pokemon, only two of which are capable of using it effectively. Bolt Strike can do huge damage coming from Zekrom's 150 base Attack and a STAB boost, and has excellent coverage with Zekrom's STAB Dragon-type attacks. Meanwhile, Victini appreciates the additional coverage and power granted by Bolt Strike, especially on physically-based sets where Water-types threaten to wall it otherwise.</p>
