<h2>History</h2>

<p>Snorlax  has always been a really, really good Pok&eacute;mon. However,  there are two undeniable facts that one must consider when making an  assessment of its history: 1. The roles it has played have varied a ton  from generation to generation, and 2. It will never be as good as it was  in the past, relative to its own environment. Let's begin our journey  back in the dark ages known as RBY, where Snorlax was best known for  being a huge pain in the ass that was blocking your way to Fuschia  City.</p>

<p>Competitively, Snorlax was great in RBY. I'm certainly no expert in the generation, but my sources tell me it was essentially a tank that could beat almost anything one-on-one, and had STAB on Hyper Beam (which  was actually good back then) and Body Slam. I know even less about GSC,  but if there's one thing that you can be certain about, it's Snorlax's  absolute dominance over the entire competitive scene. Almost anyone you  talk to will tell you that if we were to go by today's tiering  standards, Snorlax would have been Uber without a question in GSC. Many  even agree that it was better than actual Ubers like Celebi and Ho-Oh.  With access to Lovely Kiss, Belly Drum, Curse, Earthquake, Fire Blast,  and STAB Body Slam and Selfdestruct, along with massive bulk and really  high Attack, it's no wonder this is the case. Snorlax could essentially  do anything it wanted to in GSC, and building a good team without Snorlax was, and still is, considered impossible.</p>

<p>Then came ADV, and with it, the fall of Snorlax. Well, not really. Many  still consider Snorlax a top tier Pok&eacute;mon in ADV, with its  ability to check or counter many of the metagame's top threats while  still posing a big offensive threat to the opposition via Curse or  all-out attacking sets. The true fall of Snorlax came in DPP, where its  great tanking abilities were just not quite enough to pull off its  classic Curse set effectively. Other sets were even worse off, being  mostly outclassed by other DPP titans such as Tyranitar.</p>

<p>Then  finally, the fifth generation rolled around and Snorlax found itself,  for the very first time, in the realm of Underused. While many consider  this unfortunate, we UU players have been loving it so far. In BW UU,  Snorlax is considered by many to be the best Pok&eacute;mon in the  tier, and even those who disagree are in no way contesting that it is  among the absolute best. Let's get into why.</p>

<h2>Qualities</h2>

<p>The  first thing worthy of note about Snorlax in BW UU is that it is the  only Pok&eacute;mon in the tier that can reliably switch into  Chandelure. This alone would be enough to make it great, but the fact is  there's a plethora of other reasons why Snorlax is good.</p>

<p>For  one, there's that amazing base 160 HP and 110 Special Defense that  allows it to brush off most special hits. Its Attack is nothing to scoff  at either, also sitting at an above average 110. The remainder of  Snorlax's stats are mediocre at best, sitting at 65 Special Attack and  Defense, and a virtually nonexistent 30 Speed. However, what's cool  about this stat distribution is that its absolutely massive HP allows us  to invest no EVs in it and only small quantities in its defenses to  improve its bulk exponentially. This frees up a lot of EVs to invest in  its Attack, ensuring its ability to really put the hurt on enemies.  </p>

<p>Then there's also the ability factor.  Typically, Normal-types are shunned because of their lack of  resistances, but Snorlax's Thick Fat changes this by giving it a  resistance to Ice- and&mdash;more importantly&mdash;Fire-type  attacks. Its movepool is also noteworthy, as what with its STAB Return  or Body Slam and Crunch, Pursuit, Earthquake, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and  even obscure options like Seed Bomb, Superpower, and Zen Headbutt, it  has no shortage of viable moves. Even its support movepool is also  decent, with moves such as Whirlwind, Yawn, and Curse being the most  noteworthy.</p>

<h2>Playing with Snorlax</h2>

<p>Its  most prominent role in high level UU play is similar to the one it  played in RBY: a tank that can beat nearly anything one-on-one, which it  accomplishes via its Choice Band set. With an EV spread of 252 Atk / 52  Def / 200 SpD / 4 Spe, it can tank all sorts of special hits from  offensive behemoths such as Zapdos and still have enough physical bulk  to tank a +1 Outrage from Kingdra after Stealth Rock. It should also go  without saying that with a Choice Band equipped, Snorlax OHKOes virtually  every offensive Pok&eacute;mon in the tier. A variation of this set  is also seen sometimes, the main difference being that it runs  Leftovers (and sometimes Protect) to try to prolong its lifespan.  </p>

<p>The next best sets are Snorlax's trademark Curse sets, which in BW UU, come in two variations: offensive and defensive. Offensive CurseLax uses a lot more Attack EVs and doesn't bother with Rest, opting to use three attacks instead. The idea is to scare something off as it sets up Curse and then proceed to go on a mini-rampage by simply being impossible to 2HKO and O-2HKOing almost everything in return. This set is typically used in bulky offense or more offensively-oriented balanced teams. Defensive CurseLax aims to act as more of an "all-game-long" tank that only sweeps late-game if presented the opportunity. With this in mind, it's obviously EVed in a much more defensive manner and is used on more defensively-oriented balanced teams. The main problem with these sets is that the UU metagame is so offensive that they find it hard to get a turn to set up.</p>

<p>Finally there's the old  standard RestTalk + Whirlwind set which was considered the best special  wall in the tier until the metagame shifted to a much more offensive  pace. The recent discovery of Foul Play Umbreon did it no favors either,  as it took away one of the few advantages Snorlax had over  Umbreon&mdash;the ability to actually hurt things. This set is  generally considered very mediocre now, mostly because it's a huge  momentum-killer.</p>

<h2>Playing Against Snorlax</h2>

<p>If  you're trying to hard-counter Snorlax with something that's actually  UU-viable, you can forget it, because it's not happening. Actually, I  lied; I guess Sableye counters it pretty reliably, but other than that,  you can forget about it. Dragon Tail Rhyperior is pretty close, but as  gimmicky as it sounds, Seed Bomb is sometimes seen on Snorlax precisely  for this reason. Taunt Gligar also beats most versions of it, as it  isn't even 2HKOed by Choice Band Ice Punch (but it has to Roost against  it to halve the damage done), which is rare to begin with. However, it  will lose against Leftovers versions if they land a paralysis with Body  Slam and use Ice Punch afterwards. However, these scenarios are all  pretty rare, so these two are still extremely safe options to deal with  Snorlax.</p>

<p>Choice Band versions are the hardest  to switch into, but also the easiest to play around. Their lack of  recovery and weakness to the very common Fighting-type attacks cuts  their lifespan shorter than any other version. CurseLax, on the other  hand, is quite a bit harder to play around because if it sets up a  couple of Curses, you're going to have a very hard time taking it down.  However, that initial setup is not very easy to achieve against a  well-constructed team, making it a lot less dangerous. This is the  primary reason for Rhyperior needing Dragon Tail if it plans to switch  into Snorlax often, as without it, it risks becoming set-up bait for  Curse variants.</p>

<p>In all honesty, the easiest  way of dealing with Snorlax is by simply hitting it hard enough that it  won't be able to come in and do its thing more than once or twice. Using  extraordinarily strong attacks such as Life Orb Rain Dance Kingdra's  Hydro Pump or Life Orb Zapdos's Thunderbolt will make it think twice  about switching in in the first place, as Snorlax usually plays a very  crucial role on people's teams, making it a bad idea to let it get worn  down that much before it actually does anything.</p>

<h2>Fitting Snorlax onto Your Team</h2>

<p>More  like "how do I avoid using Snorlax on all my teams", to be honest.  There are very, very few teams in UU that wouldn't benefit in one way or  another from adding Snorlax to their roster, and most of them are  extremely offensive ones that simply can't afford to run a  Pok&eacute;mon that slow. I'm not exaggerating, either; as of late,  many top players have noticed that the typical teambuilding style has  become: "start with Snorlax, add one or two good Snorlax partners, fill  in the gaps". </p>

<p>Who are these good Snorlax  partners, you ask? There's a few ways this question can be answered. If  you're looking for a two-Pok&eacute;mon core featuring Choice Band  Snorlax that can cover nearly the entire metagame pretty well, look no  further than Offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus. Snorlax tanks nearly all  the special attackers in the tier pretty well while Cofagrigus does the  same with physical attackers. Choice Band Snorlax is also a huge threat  under Trick Room to boot. Now, if you're willing to dedicate half your  team to such a core in exchange for a little more reliability, you can  go with both Slowbro and Nidoqueen as partners. The principle is  similar, except it eases pressure on the physical side of things by  letting Nidoqueen tank the most common Fighting-type in the tier,  Heracross, meaning double-Fighting-type strategies won't break through  your core as easily.</p>

<p>On the offensive side of  things, Fighting-types actually make good partners for Snorlax. Choice  Band variants, anyway. This is due to the fact that Snorlax is one of  the most effective users of Pursuit in the tier, and we all know how  much Fighting-types love Pursuit support. Paralysis support from  partners such as Slowking and Togekiss is also a great help to Snorlax,  as it will let it overcome its flawed Speed to rampage past enemy  teams.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There  isn't much to think about, really. You should already be using Snorlax,  and if you're not, then you were going to eventually. It's really that  good. Until next time!</p>
