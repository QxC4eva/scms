<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Defense by three stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Cotton Guard can transform almost any Pokemon into a formidably bulky wall on the physical side, and the sheer scale of the boost itself makes it more worthy of a moveslot than most other defensive boosting moves. However, it has a fairly poor distribution, with only six fully evolved Pokemon able to use it. The most prominent user is Altaria, thanks to its decent base stats and good typing. Whimsicott is also a notable user. In general though, defensive boosting moves are rarely seen due to their relative unreliability when compared to offensive boosting moves.</p>
