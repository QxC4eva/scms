<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This move should never be used competitively, due to its poor Base Power, low flinch chance, and poor distribution; the move is learnt only by Cubone, Smeargle, and Marowak, and of these, only the Bone Keeper line could possibly use it to any effect. However, not only are they rare sights, they would both prefer to use the more powerful Earthquake or Bonemerang.</p>
