<p>Have you ever had fantasies about being ripped, muscular, and desired by all genders? Were you never able to accomplish such goals due to lack of experience, motivation, or not even knowing where to start? Well, fret not, as there is now a place to go for such things on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown!, deemed the Health & Fitness room. Now, although the room's title is quite broad, the room itself entails more things than one might assume. It both encourages the discussion of fitness and delves into the various aspects of how one can achieve fitness. It revolves entirely around the userbase and helping each other with issues he or she might have while developing a healthy lifestyle. So, let us take this time and go over what exactly Health &amp; Fitness covers.</p>

<ul>
 
  <li><p>As one would expect, the room helps give people who are new to the life of rigorous training a place to start, whether it is a list of basic exercises that they should try in their free time or all the way down to a full dedicated regime to follow.</p></li>
 
  <li><p>Worry not, though, as the room also helps more experienced athletes or bodybuilders with helpful advice to help better their progress and improvement.</p></li>
 
  <li><p>Leaning more towards the Health side of things, the room also offers dietary advice for people looking to trim a few pounds or live a healthier lifestyle.</p></li>
 
</ul>

<p>As you can see, the room can expand into a variety of different topics regarding staying healthy or being in shape. I can bet you're certainly asking yourself by now, "Why is such a room on a Pok&eacute;mon simulator, of all things? That doesn't make much sense." While it may be seen as confusing after a brief look at the room, the reasoning behind it is quite simple: certain people need help and don't know where to look to. Many people in modern times dislike their body figure and feel uncomfortable going to a public gym, in fear that they will be mocked or look out of place. The appeal of having a place to anonymously confess your lack of exercise is tremendous, which is the reason why people take to online chatrooms such as the Health &amp; Fitness room.</p>

<p>Now, I am certain that many of you are already wondering, "Where can I start to get in shape?" Well, that's quite a broad question with a plethora of answers. One of the most simple responses would be to develop a diet riddled with important nutrients and lacking in unhealthy, sugary foods. After that, one can begin working on an exercise plan, since it is nearly impossible to become extremely fit without a proper diet. After you become comfortable with your current exercise and dietary plans, you can increase the intensity of the former, helping increase the gains you get. If you check out the room, the experienced regulars will be sure to cover these in more detail if you want more information.</p>

<p>We can now briefly touch on the more fun parts to give you a general idea as to what the room typically talks about: some myths and why they're wrong. As we all know, many a time people have tried persuading us into believing silly ideas in an attempt to make us look, well, silly. Here's just a few of the health-related myths that are discussed in the room, and just how they're bogus.</p>

<ul>
 
  <li><p><strong>Spot Reduction</strong> &mdash; A common myth in the fitness department, it has come to debate about whether or not focusing exercise on one area of the body can result in removing fat from that specific area.</p></li>
 
  <li><p><strong>Eating Before Bed</strong> &mdash; Many people have heard in the past that eating before bed can make you gain extra weight you may or may not want, but this is false. Weight gain only comes from a lack of exercise after eating, and has nothing to do with when it is eaten.</p></li>
 
  <li><p><strong>Women Becoming Overly "Buff"</strong> &mdash; Many times women forgo heavy exercise or weight lifting, fearing that they would become too "buff", though that is far from the truth. Many women (and men) lack the testosterone to yield extreme gains from weight lifting, only achieving such results when done in extreme circumstances with assistance from outside additives, such as steroids. What really happens when you weight lift is that your body begins to remove excess body fat while slowly building up muscle.</p></li>
 
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there are plenty of myths and facts in both health and fitness, and the room can help you figure out what's real in hopes to teach you about how to reach your body's potential. It's a worthwhile room that can help plant the seed of a new life or a new body into your world, and is definitely worth a check if you ever feel the desire to improve upon yourself. And while it may seem to be the exact opposite of what you would expect to find on a Pok&eacute;mon simulator, it is a friendly room that can harbor great advice, all while being backed up by a supportive and encouraging userbase.</p>
