<div class="aside"><p>I sat while sipping some coffee, waiting for blarajan to come back from the prestigious Little Cup convention.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>I am back.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>Ah, awesome. Well, thanks for agreeing to let me interview you.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>Yes sir.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>He tipped his Murkrow cap.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>So tell me, what was your plan going into World Cup?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>Well, I started WCoP way later than the other teams.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>Oh, really?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I leaned in. "This seemed interesting," I thought to myself.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>Asia was very dysfunctional until a week before r1 started. Originally, we thought our core members were getting removed, to the point where we didn't want the team at all. Then we got told we could keep the members, but at that point no one wanted to captain, so we went through like two captains until I stepped up to do it. That was about a week before r1, so really I didn't have much of a strategy. I was just sniping as many players as I could.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>Damn, sounds like a lot going on for you, haha.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>I got my Asia players back: PttP, Squirrel, and Dice. That would have secured Eo. I got Shakeitup to play for us. I also got FLCL to want to, so I thought we had some good stuff going on…but then drama happened. I couldn't have FLCL and Dice, and Eo didn't want to play, but player sniping was the goal/strategy, I guess.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>Haha, seems like even though it wasn't "all figured out," things really fell into place. Speaking of Shakeitup, what do you think about him leaving team USA East for Asia?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>Nah, they didn't, they did not fall into place.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>Why would you say that?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I felt like I hit a nerve of some sort.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>Because in the cases of FLCL and Dice, I was given permission on multiple occasions to have the players...but through TD 180s and whatever, I ended up losing them after integrating them into the team. Dice, sure, whatever, he's a lying piece of shit. But FLCL was a really annoying issue and I'm not happy with that one bit.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>Ouch, sorry to hear that.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I laughed a bit nervously, thinking I should change the subject.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>In regards to Shake:</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Thank God.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>I don't think much of that. He didn't think he would start for East. I let him start. :)</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I could see his smirk a mile away.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>Ah. Are you satisfied with the team's performance during Round 1?</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>He took a sip of his Yoo-Hoo before answering.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>I'm satisfied taking into consideration the amount of effort we put into r1 matches, ie, none. We would literally find teams minutes before our games…but going forward, we need to step things up.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>Speaking of stepping things up, are there any threats that you see in the coming round that you feel you must most prepare for?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>Your team. :(</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>I couldn't help but chuckle.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>East is the only beast we are particularly scared of because the amount of teambuilding talent on that roster is insane, only losing 1 XY game out of 15? Holy shit! We're confident that if we prepare well enough we can handle the other teams reasonably well, but East scares us the most.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>Shout outs to the based lord himself and HUGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. In regards to East, do you think a repeat of the finals Asia vs East is possible?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>That depends on seed. If we end up sixth seed, most definitely, otherwise, we're meeting up in semifinals!</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>He pounded his hands on the desk while saying this as if declaring that it is gonna happen.</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>I think that's how that works. East and Asia will meet up, it just might be semis instead of finals.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>That will be interesting. In regards to the tournament itself, what do you think about the multigen format as opposed to last years all BW?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>I'm mixed.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>How so?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>I'm grateful we don't have 8 people playing XY because that's just so annoying and it's just ALL matchup…but I feel multigen made the tournament itself seem more arbitrary and even less legitimate than it already was.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>Can you elaborate on that?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>I'm not really sure what I mean&mdash;I feel that the appeal of WCoP was the whole team coming together and working together on the current generation's OU. That’s how I started WCoP, first BW 1. I just feel as if splitting it up, while making the games more interesting, took away a big part of what made WCoP what it was.</p></div>

<div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" alt="" /><p>Ah, that's a really interesting point. Well, I asked everything I needed to. Thanks again for taking the time to do this. Do you have anything else you'd like to add?</p></div>

<div class="speaker bla"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_blarajan.png" alt="blarajan" /><p>Not particularly…neutral luck to all of the remaining teams and I hope the rest of the tournament is fun. We're coming out with the trophy though.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>With that he gave me one last look, grinned, and walked out of my office.</p></div>
