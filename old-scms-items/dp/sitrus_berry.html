<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Restores 25% max HP when the holder of this item is at 50% HP or less. One-time use. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Psychic-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Sitrus Berry brings back memories of the Gym Leaders, where just as you had there Pokemon into KO range, it would activate and bring them out of it, allowing them to KO you afterwards. Fortunately, you won't have to experience any of that stress, as a Sitrus Berry is often outclassed by more consistent items such as Leftovers, as Pokemon tend to switch around more, and Leftovers recovery often means more overall recovery over time than the ever popular Berries in-game.</p>
