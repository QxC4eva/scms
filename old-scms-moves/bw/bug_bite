User steals the effect of the target's held Berry.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Should the target be holding a Berry, the user steals this and immediately consumes it; if applicable, the user will experience the Berry's effect, for instance, recovering itself from status with a Lum Berry. The user will not experience the effects of a Custap Berry or Berry Juice consumed by this move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Bug Bite may not appear an especially useful move at first, but this move certainly finds it niche. Most notably, when boosted by Technician, this is Scizor's most powerful Bug-type attack, and hence finds its way onto most Swords Dance sets. Additionally, this move is useful in Little Cup, as even though Oran Berry usage has decreased this generation, Berries are still moderately common, and so this move's secondary effect becomes crucial. Otherwise, this move is entirely outclassed by X-Scissor and Megahorn.</p>
