<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is damaged by an Ice- or Fire-type attack, damage is reduced by 50%. It has no effect on burn, freeze, or hail damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Now that Thick Fat is legal with <a href="/bw/moves/superpower">Superpower</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/icicle_crash">Icicle Crash</a>, Thick Fat has become the ability of choice for <a href="/bw/pokemon/mamoswine">Mamoswine</a>, who can use it to remove its Fire-type weakness and grant it an Ice-type resistance. Gaining two resistances at no expense is a big advantage, and so other Pokemon that get it, such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/snorlax">Snorlax</a>, will often use it as their ability of choice. While Snorlax is no longer the force it once was in OU, it is still a greatly potent threat in the lower tiers.</p>
