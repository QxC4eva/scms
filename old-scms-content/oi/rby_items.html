 <h2>Introduction</h2>

 <p>Collecting items is a fundamental part of playing Pokemon. In most cases, collecting an item is as simple as finding it on the ground and picking it up. It isn't always this easy, however, as there are many items that are hidden from view. These items will often get overlooked unless you either have prior knowledge of the item or just happen to use an item-locating device in the right location. This guide will show you where you can find every hidden item in Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow.</p>

 <h2>The Itemfinder</h2>

 <p>The Itemfinder is a key item that allows you to detect nearby hidden items. If you are following this guide, then you probably won't need to use the Itemfinder to find the majority of the items, but it can still be helpful for certain areas, such as the Underground Paths and the Cycling Road, where the items tend to lack clear reference points for pinpointing them. The Itemfinder can even be used to confirm that you have already collected an item if you begin using this guide partway through the game.</p>

 <p>To get the Itemfinder, head over to the gate east of Vermilion City and talk to Professor Oak's aide upstairs. If you have caught 30 Pokemon, he'll give you the Itemfinder as a reward. The RBY Itemfinder is not able to pinpoint hidden items; however, it will make a sound if there is a hidden item on the screen somewhere. Once the Itemfinder does its work, you'll have to search for the exact location of the item yourself.</p>

 <h2>Hidden Items</h2>

 <p>Note that the items are listed in a rough order based on when players can access them. As anyone who has played the 1st generation games will tell you, the games tend to become less linear as you progress, especially compared to the later generations. This means that some items listed further down in this guide might be obtained before items listed above them, depending on what order you prefer to complete each task. Therefore, don't feel obliged to follow the order of this guide exactly if you prefer to do things in a different order to what is presented here.</p>

 <h3>Viridian City</h3>
