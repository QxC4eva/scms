Overview
########
- Great base 140 Attack and good offensive movepool with Earthquake, Rock Slide, Megahorn, Fire Punch and Ice Punch makes it a powerful attacker.
- Good Physical bulk and Solid Rock allows it to take physical hits with ease.
- However, poor Special Defense and bad defensive typing is easily exploited by common pokemon such as Rotom-W, Mega Charizard Y and Grass-types.
- Low Speed means that it needs Trick Room support
- Very weak to Intimidate and burn

Bulky Attacker
########
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Rock Slide / Stone Edge
move 3: Ice Punch / Stone Edge
move 4: Protect
ability: Solid Rock
item: Life Orb / Sitrus Berry
evs: 252 HP/ 252 Atk /4 SpD
nature: Brave
ivs: 0 Spe

Moves
========
- Earthquake is its most powerful STAB and spread move
- Rock Slide has good coverage with Earthquake, a good 30% flinch chance, and is a good spread move that does not hit teammates,
- Stone Edge bypasses Wide Guard, and can deal much more damage to Ground-type resists than Rock Slide
- Ice Punch hits Landorus-T and should be used with Life Orb to OHKO it. It also allows Rhyperior to OHKO Breloom. Note that Ice Punch should usually be used only for these two Pokemon, as most of the time Stone Edge / Earthquake hit harder.
- Protect allows it to last longer and gives its partner a turn to set up Trick Room

Set Details
========
- Max Attack and HP allow it to be a powerhouse under Trick Room to deal a lot of spread damage to the team.
- Life Orb can be used to boost Rhyperior's power, while Sitrus Berry gives it more longevity.

Usage Tips
========
- Rhyperior should smack things around with great offensive coverage and powerful STABs
- Rhyperior should stay out of the field until Trick Room is up, using Protect and switching out when necessary.
- Rhyperior is a great late-game sweeper in Trick Room, so it and a Trick Room partner should be kept until late-game to sweep.
- Rhyperior should Protect cautiously in Trick Room, as it needs to be offensive when it can.
- Rhyperior should switch out on Wide Guard users since he doesn't stand a chance.
- Since Rhyperior is very prone to burns and Intimidate, use smart prediction so that it stays healthy.

Team Options
========
- Light Screen support is great, and Rhyperior loves Trick Room.
- Grass-types are good for sponging the Water- and Grass-type attacks that Rhyperior hates, as well as resisting Earthquake. Trevenant is a good partner as it also has an immunity to Fighting-type moves and access to Trick Room. Amonguss can also Rage Powder Water-type attacks away from Rhyperior.
- Levitate users and Flying-types make great partners to Rhyperior as they are immune to Earthquake.
- Cresselia can provide Trick Room, Light Screen, and Helping Hand support, and can also do well against two Pokemon that threaten it: Landorus-T and Hitmontop with Ice Beam / Icy Wind and Psyshock, respectively. It also has Levitate.
- Tyranitar can be used to provide sand support for Rhyperior, boosting its Special Defense, but gives away team synergy.
- Feint users like Pinsir and Hitmontop allow Rhyperior to hit through Protect users, which would otherwise waste precious Trick Room turns. Feint also breaks Wide Guard.

Other Options
########

- Lightning Rod can be used to redirect Electric-type attacks from its teammates, but it sacrifices the bulk that Solid Rock gives.
- Explosion can be used, but is usually outclassed by other options which provide better coverage.
- Megahorn can be used to hit Cresselia and Grass-types.
- Lum Berry sets can be run to avoid burns and other status
- Assault Vest can be used to boost Rhyperior's low Special Defense at the expense of Protect.
- Weakness Policy can be run to take advantage of Rhyperior's many weaknesses and Solid Rock. This is very situational, however.
- Stealth Rock can be used to cut down the longevity of Charizard Y, Talonflame, Pinsir, Volcarona, etc.
- Swords Dance boosts Rhyperior's Attack to aid it in sweeping.
- Drill Run bypasses Wide Guard, hits harder than Earthquake, and does not affect your teammates.
- Rindo Berry and Passho berry allow Rhyperior to take a Water- or Grass-type attack and 2HKO most Water- and Grass-types back with Stone Edge.

Checks & Counters
########

**Speed Control**: 

Cutting Trick Room support from Rhyperior by means of Taunt or another Trick Room hurts it badly.

**Attack Control **: 

Rhyperior, as a physical attacker, does not like the Attack drop from Intimidate and will usually be forced to switch out. Hitmontop and Landorus-T are good examples of this and can switch into Rhyperior's STAB attacks easily. Will-O-Wisp users such as Dusclops and Gardevoir can burn it.

**Utility Moves **: 

Wide Guard prevents Rhyperior from using its two STAB spread moves, Rock Slide and Earthquake, but Rhyperior can bypass this by running Stone Edge or Ice Punch. Good Wide Guard users include Aegislash and Hitmontop, who both resist Stone Edge. Protect stalls out Trick Room turns.

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: 

- Ammonguss, with enough physical investment, can switch into any of its moves bar Ice Punch and 2HKO back with Giga Drain.
- Breloom can switch into Rhyperior's STAB attacks and threaten with Bullet Seed or Spore.
- Checking it is easier however, and Rhyperior's 4x weaknesses to Grass- and Water-type attacks and its low Speed are exploitable by Pokemon like Rotom-W and Mega Charizard Y.
