<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cures confusion. Activates when the Pokemon is confused. One-time use. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Ground-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There are very few reasons to use the Persim Berry. Dragon-types can use the Persim Berry to stop the confusion caused by Outrage (so they can attack again without the risk of attacking themselves). Lum Berry is usually a better option for this though, as it will also prevent other statuses from crippling your Pokemon.</p>
