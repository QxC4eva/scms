<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Water-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed during the damage calculation. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Water-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Passho Berry may look like a poor held item choice, however it has its uses. The most notable use is to lure in bulky Water-types with Heatran, avoid the KO using the Passho Berry, and then make them faint or at least severely dent them with Explosion. Other Pokemon that are weak to Water, such as Tyranitar, have better items or resist Berries to use, as they can't seriously damage most Water-types, which is the reason why Passho Berry is often shunned in favor of more useful items.</p>
