<div style="border: solid 1px #adadad; background-color: #ededed; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Man, has it been a while since I posted a team here&mdash;if I recall correctly the last one was Heavenly Star, a bulky offense team based on synergy to work. You may know me as a reckless offense player, but lately I've been into some other stuff (don't wrong think this, please). Basically, one day, when Latias was still around, a thought came to me after being slumping in standard OU for a while. What if I change my style for a bit? Seemed kind of hard to completely change how you play from one day to the other, but I was willing to take this shot. This team, which may be my most successful OU team, is based on the principle of layers and defense; call it "semistall" if you want (although I know some people rage at that term). Anyways, I'm basically retiring this, but feel free to shoot suggestions, as I'm sure there's some stuff that can be changed.</p>

<p>This team peaked #1 on the OU ladder, breaking 1710 CRE (and still rising!), with a mean rating of 1890+ and a deviation of less than 50 on the account "Espada Ulquiorra"; it also went undefeated R1 in the World Cup of Pokemon. As of today it has lost very very few matches, making it the most solid and consistent team I've used.</p>

Forretress @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP/4 Def/252 SDef<br />
Impish nature (+Def, -SAtk)<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Payback</p>

<p>Forretress may be my favorite lead in OU, and for a good damn reason: it can set up against a vast amount of other leads, come in later because of its massive resistances, and also provide spin support and a counter to stuff like no HP Fire Gengar.</p>

<p>In early game I really play cautiously with Forry, since layers are the main thing of this team; losing the set-upper would be a huge hit to how it works. Mid game, I play it to the opposite, mostly recklessly without switching too much and just caring about getting either those layers missing or removing my opponent's. Finally, on the late game I just use it as sacrificing fodder, since getting swept late game is more factible than either early or mid game, and Forry proves to be quite the set up fodder for offensive teams sometimes.</p>

<p>The EVs are from the Latias metagame, where Forries were supposed to run Special Defense in order to take on Specs Draco Meteors. Although both Latias and Mence are gone, I decided to keep this spread because you'd be surprised how amazing it is to set up on defensive and Shadow Ball-locked Rotom, most Vaporeon, Suicune, Jirachi, Celebi, Shaymin, and the like. The moveset talks by itself, using double layer there to hurt switch-ins as most as possible, with Rapid Spin support, and Payback to hit Ghosts. I have thought of using Gyro Ball in order to not only still hurt Gengar badly (in fact it hurts it more than Payback), but also hitting stuff like Flygon harder, yet Payback still appears as the most important option because of one thing, Rotom. I forgot something, Forry is usually the mon that goes to sleep against Breloom (god, I hate them) because it can't hurt them much, and I consider this to be part of his job.</p>

Heatran @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 248 HP/128 Spd/132 SDef<br />
Calm nature (+SDef, -Atk)<br />
- Lava Plume<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk<br />
- Roar</p>

<p>Look, whenever you ask me what is my favorite Heatran set or what is the best Heatran set in my opinion, you will know the answer: that one above is THE Heatran set. How it is so uncommon is beyond me, but, man, this thing is one of those Pokémon you would call "anti metagame". Steel typing is amazing, but couple it with Fire and you have a big Celebi, Shaymin, Scizor, Zapdos, Rotom, Blissey, and more counter. This guy used to have Toxic back in the day because things like Vaporeon, Suicune, Flygon, Gyarados, and Swampert loved to switch in, but with the removal of Latias, I decided to change it with Roar, which makes this Heatran my main defense against things like Calm Mind Jirachi (one of the things Latias covered) and also an amazing shuffler. Things usually go like this: I bring in Heatran on whatever, they switch expecting a Fire move, and they just get Roared eating layer damage and staying in a tough position too, which makes a lot of mindgames begin, and of those mindgames, none are risky for me.</p>

<p>The EV spread with Calm nature gives me enough bulk to the extent of not being 2HKOed by things like a Suicune Surf, which is really appreciated if Vaporeon goes down. Also it isn't 3HKOed by Rotom and Zapdos Thunderbolt, so you can imagine how much bulk this friend has. The speed is enough to beat 0 Speed Suicune, most Taunt Skarmory, Roar Gyarados, Modest Empoleon, Magnezone with max Speed, and Adamant Tyranitar. The moveset is also self explanatory. Picked Lava Plume over Flamethrower because a 50%~ chance of burning after 2 moves is awesome, plus now I can abuse the burn since I lack Toxic. It also helps as a pseudo-counter to Gyarados, Tyranitar, and Kingdra, who switch in thinking they are completely safe. Roar I already explained, phazing and layer purposes, and Sleep Talk makes this thing durable enough to last a whole game even if it appears on the first 3 turns.</p>

<p>Togekiss used to have this spot in order to beat Mixmence and Latias and be the status helper, but SpDef Tran took those way better, added key resistances, played much more easily, and also became the status absorber.</p>

<p>Some calcs:</p>

<pre>0 SpAtk Vaporeon Surf vs Heatran - (43.64% - 51.43%)
0 SpAtk Suicune Surf vs Heatran - (36.36% - 43.64%)

Flygon @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP/252 Atk/252 Spd<br />
Jolly nature (+Spd, -SAtk)<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Outrage</p>

<p>When making this team I definitely needed a Scarfed revenge killer, as do most teams. You may think this Flygon is just a revenger, but in reality, I like to call it the team's sweeper. You'd be very surprised at how this Flygon literally sweeps late game. Mence and Latias going out hurt this team in the sense it made Infernape and Breloom more common, which are troublesome mons, but they also did a blessing for the team&mdash;their removal caused a drastic change in how teams are built. It's going to be weird to see a time with more than 2 steels, and commonly one of those is a lead. From my experience using this team, Steels come out very, very early in the game, trying to stop Rotom or Jirachi, maybe sometimes Forretress in the case of Magnezone.</p>

<p>The deal with this is that if I have layers up, which is almost always, the only thing I have to do is play with 5 mons all the game tanking hits, and bringing Flygon sometimes to U-turn out, inflicting more layers damage. By the end, Flygon shall easily sweep with Outrage because his counters are damaged/dead, and this strategy has won me a lot of games that looked lost. You could say Flygon is the player of the team that loves layers the most. Also, Earthquake is amazing with no Latias / Mence, since I can actually spam it a bit without the fear of DD Mence setting up on my face or CM Latias doing the same! Fire Blast is for Skarmory and Forry mainly, Skarm is 2HKOd after SR which helps a lot in key situations, and Forry is OHKOd which is amazing when you pull it off. U-Turn is an obvious move. I have considered Thunderpunch or Stone Edge on Flygon, but hitting Skarm badly is helpful in many scenarios that I just cannot pass that. Flygon is my main answer to eveything with "Dragon Dance" in its name, as well as things like Infernape which need to be EQd to kill them, Agility Metagross and Empoleon, and is a valuable team player due to its ability to get in on stuff like Earth Power from Shaymin and Celebi. All around, it's usually the man who cleans the opponent's team.</p>

Rotom-w @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP/252 Spd/252 SAtk<br />
Timid nature (+Spd, -Atk)<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Trick<br />
- Hydro Pump</p>

<p>I bet when you read the team building process of this team, when I mentioned Rotom, you were all "blech, that damp Rest Talk Rotom again... so unoriginal..." Well, let me tell you something, this set is the best Rotom set ive ever used in my POKÉCAREER. Again, remember when I mentioned a team of choice in the Manaphy metagame? That's where Rotom comes from. I needed a spin blocker, and Gengar was too damn weak, so using Rotom seemed cool. Then I decided to slap on Specs just because I felt like it, and man, this thing is a beast with layers. Not only does it stop Rapid Spin like a pro (and does it even better due to Wish support from Vap), but it hits like a truck. Hydro Pump OHKeOs Heatran, Gliscor, Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and all the bunch, and it also OHKOs standard Scarf Tyranitar with Spikes and SR up&mdash;yeah, it's that strong. Thunderbolt doesnt get behind; it 2HKOs even the bulkiest Jirachi, Scarf Tyranitar, every Forretress and Heatran (up to 75% damage offensive ones), it does around 80% to standard Band Scizor, and it even 2HKOs Scarf Rotoms! Oh, but the best part isn't all that, but Thunderbolt has an inmense chance of OHKOing a Lucario after Stealth Rock, so this thing also acts as a Lucario counter; it also 2HKOs a Suicune that has +1, in case Vaporeon fails somehow. Also everything with similar bulk to Lucario or less will be OHKOed by Thunderbolt even if it's neutral. Shadow Ball is used for things like Shaymin, as even max HP Shaymin is 2HKOd after Stealth Rock; Celebi is a OHKO, it OHKOes even the bulkiest Rotom, hits Grounds when I don't feel like risking Hydro Pump, and the like. Trick is for Blissey and Snorlax; although I barely use it, between Roars from Heatran on Blissey/Lax and layer damage, Rotom can usually KO them when they try to get in on them. Trick also works as an "oh, crap" button in case a last mon set upper tries to beat me.</p>

<p>Although I already said Flygon acts as a cleaner, this thing is huge part of Flygon working. Due to being able to hurt everything that switches in, Flygon will have a much easier time. Also if Flygon is the cleaner, this thing is the sweeper really, since its the mon that takes advantage of layers the most.</p>

Vaporeon @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Water Absorb<br />
EVs: 180 HP/252 Def/36 Spd/40 SDef<br />
Bold nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Wish<br />
- Protect<br />
- Surf<br />
- Roar</p>

<p>Aaahh, good ol' reliable Vappy. Actually, not so old, the first time ever I used a Vaporeon on a team was on the Latias version of this one, so I'm kind of a newb with it! Vaporeon was picked as the team's bulky water for a good amount of reasons; first, it has recovery, something that was a must. Second, it can pass around the Wishes healing the team. Third, it has a phazing move. Fourth, Vaporeon is cute. When I first made the team Vaporeon, like Heatran, had Toxic, not Roar. With the byebye of Latias, I was left without a Suicune counter, especially Rest ones, therefore I had to remove Toxic and add Roar, and I do not regret it, this thing spreads passive damage around like no one!</p>

<p>Vaporeon is my main counter to other Waters, being able to tank Suicune, Swampert, other Vaporeons, and even Gyarados. It'' s also a reliable check to Kingdra, specially if I haven't shown Roar, since they Sub just to take a lot of damage. Also, even though its not really a counter, Vaporeon really helps me against something that would otherwise screw me over badly, Life Orb Gengar. Those Gengar can prove annoying if they have both Focus Blast and HP Fire, but Vaporeon is only 3HKOed by Shadow Ball, making it a reliable switch. Same applies for Heatran, since they can really hurt everything in my team, except mighty Vaporeon, who comes in and threatens to KO with Surf, just to phaze them away and spread passive damage. All in all, Vaporeon is an awesome mon in this team.</p>

<p>Jirachi @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Serene Grace<br />
EVs: 44 HP/212 Atk/252 Spd<br />
Jolly nature (+Spd, -SAtk)<br />
- Iron Head<br />
- Fire Punch<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Substitute</p>

<p>Last but not least, the annoyer of the team and also an all around great Pokémon. Jirachi used to be a Scarfer, but with the addition of Flygon to the team, his revenge killing services were no longer required. Still, Jirachi adds yet another Dragon resistance to the team, and is one of my main answers for full stall, since everything that enjoys Iron Head completely hates Toxic, and vice versa. The last spot was the hardest one for me to pick, since I needed a Pokémon that could not only take hits, but also support the team against stall and be an "oh, crap" Pokémon in case I needed to take down something like a Breloom. When picking this spot I was completely blocked, therefore I asked for help from user panamaxis, whom I greatly thank for helping me create this set, since without him I doubt I'd have gotten to this. Jirachi is a double blessing as well; sometimes it will sweep a whole team on its own by using layers + Toxic + Iron Head, eliminating Steels with Fire Punch, and sometimes it won't do anything other than Toxicing a Swampert or Iron Heading something to kill it, but his pros outstand his cons. The way Jirachi plays is quite easy; you just switch in, hopefully when there's no layers on my side, and on something that dies to Iron Head or Fire Punch. When you kill it, the first thing that will come to the opponent’s mind is "Scarf Jirachi", going to something like Swampert to get SR or a set up Pokémon like Lucario. Thats when the surprise factor shines, hitting the switch in with something they will hate. Oh and Jirachi is also my main thing to defeat Machamp, since I only need 1 Iron Head flinch in order to put it into Thunderbolt KO range from Rotom. Btw, you can call me crazy for using 3 Steels, but seriously guys, even though Mence and Latias left, there's a lot of stuff that spam Outrage, so you gotta be careful or you will be swept by last Pokémon Outrage Flygon or something! The 44 HP supposedly helps it survive a Max Attack Breloom Focus Punch after SR and Spikes, and also helps with overall bulk, I guess. This thing also plays at everytime of the match, except very early (unless I'm facing a lead Machamp or trying to get a free sub on Dual Screen Azelf lead), as it excels in playing lategame to bluff the Scarf or mid game to spread the poison status.</p></div>

<p>Without Latias and Salamence, the OU metagame is considerably more stable. With this newfound stability, players have a greater opportunity to be creative. Reyscarface's 'Team Enclose Murciélago' is unique in that it is one of the few innovative defensive teams. He used it with great success, going 3-0 in the preliminary round of the World Cup and reaching the number one spot on the Smogon University leaderboard. The premise of this team is simple: get up Stealth Rock and Spikes and utilize the team's defensive synergy to wear down opposing Pokemon. Along with Forretress, one of the best Spikers in the game, the team has a host of defensive standards and innovate movesets.</p>

<p>Rey gets straight to business with Forretress. He hopes to get Stealth Rock up along with as many layers of Spikes as possible. Because Rey's team has a dearth of Pokemon that can sweep, he relies on entry hazards to wear his opponent down. It is absolutely essential that Forretress is able to do its job; otherwise Rey's team will have a hard time killing anything. Besides being a great spikestacker, Forretress is also a fantastic spinner. By running Rapid Spin, Rey is able to remove his opponent's entry hazards so he can make switches with greater ease. Unfortunately for Forretress, many teams run Ghost-types, which are immune to Rapid Spin. The last move, Payback, hits Ghosts hard. With a bit of prediction, Forretress can cripple Ghost switch-ins who expect a harmless Rapid Spin. The EVs maximize Forretress' special bulkiness, allowing it to set up Spikes on Pokemon that would otherwise dispose of it with relative ease. Leftovers is chosen over Shed Shell to give Forretress longevity.</p>

<p>Heatran patches up the holes in the team. It counters Zapdos, virtually all Jirachi sets, and a host of other Pokemon that would otherwise give the team a lot of problems. Heatran runs Lava Plume as its sole attack. The reliable STAB coupled with the 30% chance to burn a foe makes it an excellent choice. Since Heatran lacks reliable recovery, Rey employs the Rest / Sleep Talk combo to keep Heatran alive. The two moves pair well together, as they allow Heatran to heal itself without becoming a sitting duck. Since phazing is crucial on spikestacking teams, Heatran's last move is Roar. With its excellent typing, Heatran can come in on a variety of foes and phaze the next turn, while the opponent is damaged by Stealth Rock and Spikes. Also, Roar pairs well with Sleep Talk, because a Sleep Talked Roar has +0 priority, so Heatran can phaze out slower foes before they get a chance to attack. To fit its niche on the team, Heatran is EV'd to be specially bulky yet fast enough to outspeed some common foes.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Flygon is chosen as the team's revenge killer. It also serves as the ever-important Electric immunity and scouter. By running U-turn, Flygon forces the opponent to make multiple switches as residual damage rips their team apart. Earthquake is chosen to dispose of the likes of Jirachi, Metagross, and Tyranitar. With Outrage, Flygon can pull off lategame sweeps and check opposing Dragon-types. The last move is somewhat unorthodox. Rey chooses to run Fire Blast, so Flygon can OHKO Forretress, who usually walls it, and damage opposing Skarmory; if Flygon can get this attack off against the right opposing Pokemon, it can gamebreaking. The EVs are simple, max Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature lets Flygon tie all other Scarfed base 100s and hit with some power.</p>

<p>Where most people would expect a Choice Scarf or Rest/Sleep Talk Rotom-A, Rey deploys the innovative Specs Rotom-W. While it's not the bulkiest of spinblockers, it's extremely powerful. Its main attack, Thunderbolt, is strong enough to OHKO opposing Vaporeon. With Spikes on the field, Rotom-W is also a viable sweeper against slower teams. To make use of its dual STABs, Rotom-W runs Shadow Ball, which kills Celebi, who otherwise walls the set. Hydro Pump, Rotom-W's signature attack, is selected to hit Tyranitar. The final slot is designated for Trick, so Blissey cannot switch in with impunity. The EVs make use of Rotom-W's offensive capabilities, so it functions as a sweeper. While it's relatively frail, with proper prediction, it still makes a good spinblocker.</p>

<p>As another part of Rey's defensive core, Vaporeon handles the likes of Infernape and co., while playing a crucial support role. By using Wish, Vaporeon is capable of healing itself and the rest of the team. It works especially well when used in tandem with Forretress, who lacks reliable recovery. Because Wish takes a full turn to work, Vaporeon runs Protect. But beyond this function, Protect is great for scouting moves against Choice users. For a STAB move, Vaporeon runs the reliable Surf, which is pretty powerful in its own right, given Vaporeon's base 110 Special Attack. With no need to run Hidden Power Electric, Ice Beam, or Toxic, Rey gives Vaporeon Roar, so it can function as the team's second phazer. With its excellent defensive and healing capabilities, Vaporeon makes a reliable Roar user. Vaporeon's EVs are standard, with just enough Speed to beat opposing phazer Vaporeon.</p>

<p>The last Pokemon on the team, Jirachi, is perhaps the most unusual. Although it may look weird, by running Substitute and Toxic, Rey is able to use Jirachi to wear down a plethora of foes. The idea is to use Substitute and proceed to Toxic the opponent's switch-in. Many common Jirachi responses find themselves afflicted by crippling status. To make matters worse, Jirachi can use Iron Head and its 60% chance to flinch to Toxic stall opponents. With Jirachi's respectable base 100 Attack, Iron Head does solid damage. To round off the set, Jirachi runs Fire Punch to hit Magnezone, who would otherwise trap and kill it, and hits Lucario for heavy damage. To make sure Jirachi can effectively Toxic stall the opponent, Rey maximizes its Speed. The remaining EVs are split between Attack and HP so Jirachi is reasonable powerful while maintaining decent bulkiness.</p>

<p>Although 'Enclose Murciélago' is an excellent team, it has a few drawbacks. Life Orb Starmie forces Rey to make a series of risky predictions. In the mean time, he'll be forced to reveal a significant portion of his team to his opponent. This team should also be concerned with Lucario, since Jolly variants outspeeds Rotom-W and OHKOes Flygon with ExtremeSpeed provided it has taken some previous damage. While Rey does have the means to beat Lucario, he lacks a reliable switch-in. Ultimately, the team has very few weaknesses and its success proves that it is one of the best teams of the late-DPP metagame.</p>
