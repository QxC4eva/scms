Lowers damage from physical attacks for 5 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<p>For five turns, damage from physical attacks is reduced to 1/2. In 2v2, it is reduced to 2/3, and the effect is extended to both Pok√©mon. The effect remains even if the user switches out. A critical hit ignores the protection. If the user is holding the item Light Clay, the move lasts for 8 turns instead. If the user or its partner is hit by the move Brick Break, Reflect immediately ends.</p>
