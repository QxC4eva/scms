<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to freeze the target. In hail, this move has 100% accuracy.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Though Ice is an excellent attacking type, Blizzard is normally overlooked in favor of the far more accurate Ice Beam competitively. Blizzard should only really be used on a team featuring hail, since its accuracy is increased to 100%. Attackers such as Abomasnow and Kyurem can put a large dent in nearly anything with their STAB Blizzards; in fact, there are some teams that are entirely based around spamming the move in hail, especially in doubles. One other Pokemon of note is Rotom-F, in that it is only capable of learning Blizzard and not Ice Beam â€“ though Rotom-F may have poor defensive typing, it receives excellent power and coverage from Blizzard, provided that it hits, and can also get STAB on Electric-type attacks to supplement it. Any other use of Blizzard outside of hail is not recommended.</p>
