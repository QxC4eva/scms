[LONG DESC] 
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder's stats cannot be lowered. It does not prevent self-inflicted stat drops, such as the Speed drop from <a href="/bw/moves/curse">Curse</a> or the Attack and Defense drop from <a href="/bw/moves/superpower">Superpower</a>. It also does not block the effects of <a href="/bw/moves/haze">Haze</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/heart_swap">Heart Swap</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/guard_swap">Guard Swap</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/power_swap">Power Swap</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Clear Body may seem unimpressive at first, but can actually prove to be extremely effective under certain conditions. <a href="/bw/pokemon/metagross">Metagross</a> is a powerful physical attacker, but <a href="/bw/pokemon/gyarados">Gyarados</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/salamence">Salamence</a> can often Intimidate a physical attacker, reducing its usefulness. Metagross does not have to worry about this, and as a result, is undaunted by any attempts the opponent makes to cut its sweep short, bar status or KO (it should be noted here that unless it carries <a href="/bw/moves/thunderpunch">ThunderPunch</a>, Metagross is still helpless against Gyarados). Some of the other Pokemon to obtain Clear Body have better options, but sometimes it can be effective, depending on the conditions and what that Pokemon is doing.</p>
