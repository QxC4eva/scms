<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holders Attack can be raised, it is raised one stage when HP falls to 25% or less. One-time use.</p>

<p>Provides a one-time 80 Base Power Grass-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Liechi Berry is one of a variety of items known as "pinch Berries". It provides a +1 boost in Attack at the end of a turn in which the Pokemon hits â‰¤ 25% HP. It is used most often on Substitute setup sweepers and Baton Passers. The game plan is generally to Substitute over and over again until the boost is activated; then, it is either Baton Passed to a recipient, along with (hopefully) a Substitute, or used to sweep.</p>

<p>Many Pokemon appreciate the boost in power, and Pokemon not carrying Attack-boosting moves that can instead increase their Speed can make particularly good use of it. Ideally, Substitute sweepers will have both a boost and a Substitute at the end of the process, giving them two shots to hit much more powerfully.</p>

<p>With the prevalence of priority attacks (e.g. Scizor's Bullet Punch and Lucario's ExtremeSpeed) in the metagame, however, the weakened Liechi sweeper may be picked off before it gets a chance to attack, making it relatively useless. The opponent may set up themselves while it Substitutes down, or bring in a phazer to remove the boosts. Liechi is single-use, and the user will be so weakened during activating it that it will be unlikely to come in again. Lastly, Liechi will only hit as hard as a Choice Bander, although with the ability to switch attacks.</p>

<p>When EVing a Pokemon designed to hold Liechi, consider making its HP even; although more often than not sandstorm, hail, or entry hazards will interfere with this, it allows it to activate Liechi after three Substitutes instead of four, leaving it at 25% health instead of 1%.</p>
