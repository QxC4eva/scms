<p>Alright, here we are, with Gen V in full swing. Hope you've all taken some time to get to know the game and play with the new Pokemon? Let's hope we haven't forgotten how things worked in the old days - this issue's questions are themed around the in-game mechanics; things that go on behind the scenes when you play the game. And boy-oh-boy are these ones fun.</p>
 
<p>But of course, the standard ceremonies. The winner of last issue's Trivia is <a href="/forums/member.php?u=27889">Nomad</a>! Not only did he attain a clean sweep of 10 correct answers, but he also went the extra mile and provided detail, as well as reading between the lines. That's what I like to see! And without further ado, here are the answers and questions.</p>
 
<h2>Trivia Answers</h2>
