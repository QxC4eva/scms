[Overview]

<p>Machamp is a good Pokemon. Give it some paralysis support and it can cause havoc. It has low defenses and Speed, so it definitely needs paralysis support to hurt teams. The lack of a better STAB move than Submission, as well as its typing in a Psychic-dominated metagame hurt it, but Machamp can do great damage later in the game with some prediction.</p>

[SET]
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Body Slam
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Hyper Beam
move 4: Submission

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>In a game where Normal Pokemon dominate, Machamp is not a bad choice. Just be wary of the equally dominant Psychics. Paralyzing them on the switch with Body Slam is always fun. Earthquake is for Gengar and versatility. Hyper Beam does a lot of damage as well, and is a great finishing move. Submission does more damage against Rock- and Normal-types, but remember that the recoil hurts and the accuracy is less than ideal. However, in a pinch, feel free to throw a Submission for a quicker KO.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Rock Slide can be used against Flying-types. Counter is an option against Pokemon such as Snorlax and Tauros. Since Machamp's Defense isn't huge and its HP is good, it will be able to use Counter well; just make sure you predict a Normal or Fighting attack, since Counter won't work on other physical moves. Body Slam's ubiquity may help with that.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Psychics like Alakazam, Starmie, Slowbro, and Exeggutor can all switch into Machamp easily (however, Alakazam won't enjoy a Hyper Beam) and annihilate it with Psychic, Surf, or Blizzard. Zapdos's super effective Drill Peck hurts Machamp a lot, as do the STAB attacks of Moltres and Articuno. The latter two must beware of Rock Slide, though. Venusaur is also a competent counter as it can take a hit, sleep Machamp, and then start firing away STAB Razor Leaf.</p>
