Overview
########

- Amazing defensive typing allows it to counter a multitude of almost entire typings, such as Steel-, Bug-, Fire-, and Grass-types.
- Powerful STAB spread moves in Heat Wave and Eruption.
- Formidable bulk, being able to survive even super effective attacks, such as Rotom-Ws Hydro Pump
- 4x weakness to Ground is very exploitable. It's also weak to Water- and Fighting-type moves, which are also fairly common.
- It also doesn't have too many options for coverage, leaving it easily walled by quite a few threats such as Water-types and Dragon-types.

Substitute
########
name: Substitute
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Heat Wave
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Protect
ability: Flash Fire
item: Leftovers
evs: 180 HP / 252 SpA / 76 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
- Substitute is a great move if used correctly, Heatran's resistances + immunities = not so hard to set up
- Heat Wave is for consistent STAB spread move and is easily spammable once a Substitute is up.
- Earth Power provides much-needed coverage against Rock- and Fire-types, especially opposing Heatran.
- Protect is a great move on any Doubles Pokemon, and it is very good to use alongside Substitute, since you will be double-targeted sometimes. It will also stall out field effects that are not beneficial to your side.

Set Details
========
- EVs outspeed 0 Spe Rotom-W and Cress, and throw the remaining into HP and special atk
- Modest because max power is necessary and you don't need speed or more bulk than you already get from the spread
- Leftovers is the main item choice, as it works well in tandem with SubProtect.
- Flash Fire as the ability because it gives Heatran a very unique set of resistances / immunities that help it wall things like Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y. 
- Air Balloon to temporarily avoid Ground-type moves
- Shuca Berry to lure in Ground-type coverage attackers such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and opposing heatran
- You could minimize speed and use it effectively on a Trick Room team.
- Fire Blast can also be used as alternate, single-target STAB

Usage Tips
========
- Mention that one should use Heatran ridiculous amounts of resistances / immunities to set up a Substitute.
- From there, use Heat Wave and Protect accordingly, and Earth Power for the occasional Rock or Fire
- Don't ever stay in against a Ground-type with a STAB attack, as it will easily kill you. It is also often a good idea to scout for Hidden Power Ground with Protect against Pokemon such as Latios or Genesect. If Heatran has a Substitute up, it is advised to let the Substitute break before switching.
- This Heatran set can be used effectively as a switch-in - especially from Grass-types as it has nice defensive synergy with them.

Team Options
========
- Hitmontop is by far Heatran's favorite partner (mention how Intimidate, Wide Guard, and Fake Out greatly help Heatran fulfill it's role to the max) It also has Feint, which hits through Wide Guard, letting Heatran more safely use Heat Wave.
- Icy Wind / Trick Room Cress is a great partner too (mention how Icy Wind both controls speed for Heatran and additionally hits Garchomp and Landorus-T very hard) [potentially mention Skill Swap too]
- Gardevoir / Latios = great offensive core with Heatran, they lure in Steel- and Bug-types for Heatran to set up Substitutes on. Latios also help disposing of Garchomp and can set up a Tailwind for Heatran to function better.
- Grass-types enjoy Heatran's ability to tackle Fire-types and Talonflame. Shaymin-S and Venusaur are prime examples, both of which can take Water-type and Fighting-type attacks for Heatran.
- Follow Me / Rage Powder Pokemon can redirect attacks and give Heatran openings to set up. Togekiss gets a special mention by beating Fighting-types as well.
- Water-types beat Ground-types and can hit airborne Fire-types that wall Heatran. Rotom-W is great, as it can burn Fighting-types and pummel opposing Fire-types with Hydro Pump. It also keeps Landorus-T and other Earthquakers away.
- Thundurus-I is a great partner, as it can support Heatran with priority Taunt and Tailwind, preventing the opposing use of Taunt and Wide Guard
- Heatran is also great at removing Steel-types, which can open up sweeps for a lot of offensive teammates, such as Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and Scizor.

ErupTran
########
name: ErupTran
move 1: Eruption
move 2: Heat Wave / Fire Blast
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Protect
ability: Flash Fire
item: Charcoal
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Quiet

Moves
========
- ERUPTION IS POWERFUL... at high HP
- Heat Wave is there for backup STAB spread move, and is more powerful than Eruption after Heatran's HP dips to below 64%.
- Fire Blast is a great single target option to hit Wide Guard opponents.
- Earth Power is, again, for coverage vs Fire and Rock
- Protect is great for scouting and messing up offensive strategies. Can also be used to rack up lefties recovery if you choose to use them.

Set Details
========

- Speed is minimized, since this set should be used with Trick Room support.
- Charcoal is the best item, as it boosts the power of Eruption while maintaining choice of moves and protect.
- Leftovers can also be used to help Heatran reco
- Sitrus Berry to recover HP quickly and repower Eruption quickly
- Max Spe can be used outside of TR, but really needs a Scarf because it's still outspeed by too many things

Usage Tips
========
- Mentioning the fact that Protect is very useful when outside of TR, to shield Heatran while TR is potentially set back up.
- Don't go for Eruption or Heat Wave against an obvious Wide Guard user such as Hitmontop unless you have Feint support by your side.
- Be careful not to let Heatran take too many hits, as the power of Eruption will drop significantly after HP loss. Once Heatran loses more than 45% of its health, Heat Wave will become more powerful than Eruption and should be used instead.

Team Options
========
- Trick Room setters are mandatory- Cress, Gourgeist, and Trev get their own mentions
- Cresselia is a great supporter for Heatran, since it can both set up Trick Room and support its spread moves with Helping Hand: also immune to EQ.
- Trevenant has great synergy with Heatran, it OHKOs Rotom-W and Gastrodon, and burns threatening Fighting- and Ground-types. It and other Grass-types also enjoy Heatran's ability to tank Fire-type attacks and wall Talonflame.
- Scrafty is also a great teammate: It has Intimidate + Fake Out for general support, and can deal with problematic Latios and Latias.
- Heatran appreciates Taunt support to prevent the opposing use of Taunt and Wide Guard. Thundurus-I is great for this as it can remove Water-types and also boosts its support with Prankster.
- Water-types help beat Ground- and Rock-types as well as airborne Fire-types that wall Heatran. They also bait in Grass-types for it to beat.

Attacker
########
name: Attacker
move 1: Heat Wave / Fire Blast
move 2: Earth Power / Flash Cannon
move 3: Ancient Power / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Protect
ability: Flash Fire
item: Shuca Berry
evs: 180 HP / 252 SpA / 76 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
- On this set, Heatran's main goal is to continuously launch an onslaught of attacks at the opponent.
- Heat Wave is Fire-type spread STAB that can readily rip apart unprepared teams.
- Fire Blast is single targeted and hits like a truck, but has unreliable accuracy.
- Earth Power hits Rock-types and Fire-types.
- Flash Cannon is secondary STAB to hit Dragon-types and Rock-types. It also hits Fairy-types super effectively.
- AncientPower hits Fire-types, and hits Talonflame / Mega Char Y especially hard.
- Hidden Power Ice surprises Landorus-T and Garchomp switchins and also hits Dragon-types hard.
- Protect lets you scout for Ground-type attacks and shield Heatran from potentially dangerous moves and buy time for partners to attack.

Set Details
========
- Maximum special attack + modest makes Heatran as powerful as possible.
- 76 Spe helps outspeed rotom-w and cresselia
- 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe Timid can work too for max offense
- Rest is put into HP for bulk
- Shuca Berry to guard against Earthquakes from the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp, helping Heatran effectively lure them in for the surprise OHKO
- Leftovers for recovery
- Charcoal, Life Orb, or Air Balloon could work as well

Usage Tips
========
- What this set lacks in power or setup utility it makes up with coverage.
- Try to feign a Substitute or Eruption set to lure in counters and KO them.
- Coverage attacks should be used when necessary; the rest of the time, spam Heat Wave / Fire Blast.
- Protect to scout Ground-type attacks.
- Do not stay in against Ground-types unless you know you can handle them
- Do not be afraid to sponge a few hits; Heatran lasts a long time and can switch out and come back if necessary

Team Options
========
- Wide Guard is this set's best friend. Without Substitute / Eruption to deter Ground-types, this set is more susceptible to EQ. Wide Guard also protects against Surf and Muddy Water.
- Grass-types to tackle Water-types and Ground-types.
- This set eats up Steel-types so anything walled by them appreciated the defensive opening created.
- Speed control support is really helpful with this set.
- Trick Room support can be paired with minimal speed Heatran. Cress is great as it can set TR, use Helping Hand, and set dual screens
- Tailwind is also beneficial. Things like Suicune, Talonflame, and Latias can provide this support.
- Fake Out support can stun Ground-types so Heatran can take them out
- Intimidate support weakens opponents
- Charizard-Y provides Drought to boost Heatran's Fire-type STAB
- Psychic-, Flying-, and Fairy-types are all useful as they remove Fighting-type threats. Mega Gardevoir is a great partner that can take down Fighting-types and benefits from Heatran's removal of Steel-types

Other Options
########

- Hidden Power Grass to hit Water-types
- AncientPower on the Substitute and Eruption set to hit airborne Fire-types such as Charizard and Talonflame
- Flash Cannon on the Substitute and Eruption set for fairies
- A utility set with WoW and Taunt
- Shuca / Chople Berry on Substitute and Eruption set
- Specs if you are manly enough
- Scarf for outspeeding stuff

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: 

Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gastrodon just kill. However, those that don't resist Fire must watch out when they switch in lest they take a load of damage. Water-types can both tank STAB fire attacks and hit back hard; Gastrodon, Rotom-W, Gyarados, and Keldeo eat it up. Politoed can also set rain to weaken Heatran's Heat Wave. Dragon-types with Earthquake such as Dragonite and Salamence take minimal damage from Heatran's attacks and OHKO back. Surprise HP Ground can be put a on multitude of special attackers to nail Heatran. Air Balloon Heatran also walls Heatran. Fighting-types are also threatening as many are bulky enough to sponge hits and have priority Mach Punch to bypass speed control support.

**Utility**: 

Taunt prevents Substitute, Encore locks you into it, Wide Guard blocks Heat Waves. Perish Song forces it out, even with a Substitute up.

**Defensive Typing Advantage**: 

Dragon-types resist Heat Wave and are often immune to Earth Power. Specially bulky Pokemon that are neutral to Heatran's STAB moves such as Cresselia can also wall it quite easily.

**Assault Vest Pokemon**: 

Things like AV Goodra, Ludicolo, Scrafty, and Conkeldurr can easily sponge Heatran's attacks and chip away at its health with STABs or coverage.
