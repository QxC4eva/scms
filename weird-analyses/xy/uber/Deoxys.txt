Overview
########
When looking at Deoxys, one has to wonder what it could ever possibly be used for that would give it an advantage over its other formes. That is the problem, it has no advantages. The small gain in defenses it has over Deoxys-Attack is still nowhere near enough of a reason to merit its use seriously, especially when it is also sacrificing power for an uneffective defense boost. However, a small advantage about the defense boost is that it can live Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out, something that Deoxys-Attack can't do. Deoxys still does still have very powerful 150 / 150 offenses, and 150 base Speed, so by itself it is not a bad Pokemon. Its downfall is clearly shown when it's compared to its other formes, either not having the bulk and Speed that Deoxys-Speed has, or the tremendous Attack power that Deoxys-Attack has. In Generation 5 the only semi-viable set it had was a Dual Screens set, but thanks to the buff to Defog that now makes it very common on most teams, even this set is now useless. This leaves Deoxys with no effective niche at all that can't already be accomplished by Deoxys-Attack, or Deoxys-Speed, which means unfortunately it is a completely useless Pokemon in the Ubers metagame.

Moves
========
This set is the most salvageable thing that can be done with Deoxys. Psycho Boost is the strongest STAB move that Deoxys can use, and it works very well on this set denting support Arceus formes, other entry hazard leads, or other Defog users that try to stand in its way. Stealth Rock and Spikes are two great entry hazards that Deoxys can use effectively since its base 150 offenses and Speed can still force switches, allowing it to get them up without too many problems. The last moveslot is dependant on what you wish to do, Magic Coat can anti-lead Deoxys-Speed by bouncing back its Taunt or entry hazards, rendering it effectively useless and forcing it to switch out or attack Deoxys. Taunt can accomplish a similar feat, and works better on slower entry hazard setters like Groudon as they do not carry Magic Coat to stop the Taunt. Hidden Power Fire is an option that allows Deoxys to deal heavy damage to entry hazard setters rather than keeping their hazards away. It brings Forretress down to Sturdy and 2HKOs Ferrothorn, while also having a high chance to OHKO physically Defensive Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock damage, which can be a good lure as Bullet Punch from Scizor is unable to OHKO Deoxys.

Set Details
========
Deoxys has to be as fast as possible, so run 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature. Timid does not cause any harm to Deoxys's already pitiful defenses and since no physical attacks are being used, Timid is the best choice. Maximise Special Attack to get the most from Psycho Boost and Hidden Power Fire, and add the rest to HP. Focus Sash means Deoxys is guaranteed to get up at least one layer of entry hazards.

Usage Tips
========
This Deoxys set is rather easy to use. Lead with it and aim to Taunt opposing leads or possible set up sweepers, or get up Stealth Rock first, then possibly Spikes should the opponent offer no resistance. If you think Deoxys is about to go down, Psycho Boost the enemy.

Team Options
========
Firstly, the use of Deoxys is highly discouraged due to its lack of advantages over Deoxys-Attack or Deoxys-Speed, so if you wish to have a more viable option, choose Deoxys-Attack or Speed. Should you choose to run Deoxys however, it doesn't tend to need support, as it tends to be the one that's giving it. Instead opt to have teammates that can benefit from entry hazards to ensure a sweep, such as Mega Blaziken or Extremekiller Arceus. Deoxys suits Hyper Offensive teams very well as an entry hazard setter that can also provide great offensive pressure. Mega Gengar is great to stop the opponent using Defog to remove Deoxys's entry hazards, as it can trap them, Taunt them or just eliminate them. An answer to Yveltal is necessary on teams with Deoxys leads, as it's immune to Psycho Boost and takes little damage from Hidden Power Fire. Yveltal can also Taunt Deoxys, leaving Deoxys with no options but to switch out.

Other Options
########
Generation 5's Dual Screens set is still possible, but not worth the effort thanks to Defog. An all out attacker set is certainly possible, but is completely outclassed by Deoxys-Attack in this role. Counter can take advantage of the small fact that Deoxys can live a Bullet Punch from Scizor or Mega Lucario, and retaliate back, but is a rather gimmicky option that has limited use.

Checks & Counters
########
**Defog users**: Users such as Giratina-O can effectively remove Deoxys's hazards and take out Deoxys before it can get more up with Shadow Sneak.

**Priority users**: Priority users can easily take out Deoxys as it has no room for priority of its own, limiting Deoxys to one layer of hazards before being knocked out or being forced to switch.

**Dark-types**: Dark-types such as Yveltal, Darkrai and Dark Arceus can easily take advantage of Deoxys to set up as they are immune to Psycho Boost.

**Choice Scarf users**: Possible users such as Genesect and Xerneas can outspeed Deoxys and limit its hazard laying.

**Mega Kangaskhan**: Its ability, Parental Bond, can pierce through Focus Sash and OHKO Deoxys with no problem. Deoxys does live Fake Out, however.

**Steel-types**: Resistant to Psycho Boost and can check Deoxys if it's not carrying Hidden Power Fire. Aegislash is a notable example, as Shadow Sneak will either KO Deoxys or bring it down to its Focus Sash.
