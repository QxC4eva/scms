<h2>What is Balanced Hackmons?</h2>

<p>The idea behind <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3463764">Balanced Hackmons</a> is simple; any Pokemon can have any move, any ability, and 252 EVs in each stat. While this might seem overpowering, there are a few rules set in place to create a more balanced metagame. Firstly, six abilities are currently banned: Huge Power, Pure Power, Wonder Guard, Shadow Tag, Arena Trap, and Parental Bond. Furthermore, all OHKO moves are banned. Because of its nature, Balanced Hackmons is an incredibly diverse tier filled to the brim with creativity.</p>

<h4>Rules:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wonder Guard, Pure Power, Huge Power, Shadow Tag, Arena Trap, and Parental Bond are banned.</li>
<li>All clauses are off besides OHKO clause.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Threat List</h4>

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/113.png" alt="" /> <strong>Chansey:</strong> Chansey is a threat because of its dangerous Imposter sets. These sets enable it to switch into any Pok&eacute;mon and copy their boosts; it works especially well on Chansey thanks to its high HP stat. Eviolite is also carried over, which is a large part of why Chansey is such a threat. Its ability to come in on any Pokemon, double their bulk, and receive all of their boosts make Chansey the most prominent Balanced Hackmons threat.<br /><br />

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/487.png" alt="" /> <strong>Giratina:</strong> Giratina is a large threat in the Balanced Hackmons metagame thanks to its sheer diversity and ability to perform various sets exceptionally. Its exceptional typing allows it to check numerous threats with its resistance to Fighting-, Fire-, and Water-type moves, a perfect combination. Some example sets it often runs are Prankster and Magic Bounce sets, two great checks to many prominent threats such as Mega Mewtwo X.<br /><br />

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/150-mx.png" /> <strong>Mega Mewtwo X:</strong> With fantastic attacking stats, a high Speed stat, and endless possibilities, it's not hard to see why Mega Mewtwo X is a top tier threat. WIth a variety of sets ranging from Protean to Tinted Lens, it can pull of practically anything and be successful. It's often chosen over Mega Mewtwo Y solely for its additional bulk which gives it a slight edge. Mega Mewtwo X is a threat every Balanced Hackmons team must be prepared to face.<br /><br />

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/150-my.png" /> <strong>Mega Mewtwo Y:</strong> Mega Mewtwo Y is quite similar to Mega Mewtwo X in terms of effectiveness and power, having a higher Speed stat and Special Attack instead of higtened Defenses. Commonly seen running Protean, Mega Mewtwo Y is quite the pain to switch into because of its ridiculous power and ability to change typings at will; another large threat every team must pack a counter for.<br /><br />

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/382-p.png" alt="" /> <strong>Primal Kyogre:</strong> Primal Kyogre is simply an upgraded Kyogre, one of the most fearsome Pok&eacute;mon in the game, now with even better stats! It remains a large threat with popular Poison Heal sets and the great Regenerator sets, both of which have offensive potential alongisde great natural bulk that allow it to be one of the most feared Pok&eacute;mon in the game. Something important to note is that Primal Kyogre completely outclasses Kyorge.<br /><br />

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/080-m.png" alt="" /> <strong>Mega Slowbro:</strong> Mega Slowbro has an insane Defense stat that not even Kyurem-Black is able to break throuch, allowing it to wall nearly all physical attackers in the game. Furthermore, it can run powerful Assault Vest sets to patch up its shaky Special Defene and allow it to become a fearsome wall from both time. To further boost its viability, Mega Slowbro has a high Special Attack stat of 130 which enables it to not be a sitting duck.<br /><br />
<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/383-p.png" alt="" /> <strong>Primal Groudon:</strong> Primal Groudon's new unique typing is a very good typing in Balanced Hackmons for its ability to wall popular Fairy- and Fire-types such as Diancie and Ho-Oh. Its extremely high Attack stat allows it to pull off great offensive sets, while its impressive defense allows it to pull off fantastic defensive sets; it's quite versatile. However, it is somewhat let down by its weakness to the ever common Thousand Arrows.<br /><br />

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/681.png" alt="" /> <strong>Aegislash:</strong><br /> Aegislash remains a threat from XY thanks to its unique typing that allows it to check all forms of -ate and even wall the Pok&eacute;mon that carry Fighting-type coverage alongised -ate abilitie.s This combined with its fantastic defensive stats make it a contender to break through indeed, with a popular set being a utility check with Prankster. Although it is weak to Fire- and Ground-type moves, Aegislash still can use its typing for its great resistances.<br />

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/242.png" alt="" /> <strong>Blissey:</strong> Blissey carves itself a powerful niche aside from Chansey in the form of being able to carry a plate, which makes it not beaten by Plate users such as Spooky Plate Mega Gengar, which Chansey fails to beat. This one key niche is extremely useful and it is really up to personal choice. However, it should be noted that Chansey often eclipses Blissey thanks to its higher overall bulk and reliability in general.<br /><br />

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/384-m.png" alt="" /> <strong>Mega Rayquaza:</strong> Mega Rayquaza is a new contender this generation and comes as a powerful new Aerilate user that can launch powerful attacks from its extremely high Attack stats of 180 in both. A popular set is Fake Out / Extreme Speed / boomburst (or Techno Blast) / coverage move of your choice. This set is able to break nearly everything in the entire metagame and is a threat that ever team must take into account when teambuilding.<br /><br />

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/292.png" alt="" /> <strong>Shedinja:</strong> Shedinja is a very prominent Pok&eacute;mon in the Balanced Hackmons metagame because Sturdy means that no attacks are able to OHKO Shedinja. The only way to break through it is by status, weather, entry hazards, or a Pok&eacute;mon utilizing Mold Breaker. This strategy is not unbeatable, however, as the metagame has adapted to it and made Shedinja less of a threat than it was before with Mold Breaker Mega Gengar being so common.<br /><br />

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/719-m.png" alt="" /> <strong>Mega Diancie:</strong> Mega Diancie is another new Balanced Hackmons contender and is certainly a strong one.  Like it's other new contender, Mega Rayquaza, Mega Diancie also utilizes an -ate ability in the form of Pixilate. Diancie similarly runs the same set as Mega Rayquaza as well. Mega Diancie's solid bulk, Speed, and power make it a new threat that can use its powerful attacks to weaken and / or sweep worn down teams later in the match.<br /><br />

<img src="/tiers/om/metagames/720-u.png" alt="" /> <strong>Hoopa-Unbound:</strong> Hoopa-Unbound carves itself a niche in the Balanced Hackmons metagame through its unique move, Hyperspace Fury. The main reason this move stands out is because Chansey is unable to copy it, making Hoopa-U an excellent Chansey-immune setup sweeper. Since Hyperspace Fury fails when not used by Hoopa-Unbound, so Chansey will have nothing to hit Hoopa-U with. Furthermore, Stored Power works fantastically alongside Shell Smash, because it, too, is immune to it being a Dark-type. Hoopa-Unbound is an excellent Pokemon that is very difficult to deal with in the Balanced Hackmons metagame.
