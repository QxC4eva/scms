<h3>Creation of the PU Subforum</h3>

<p><a href="/forums/threads/.3513882">PU</a> is an unofficial tier below NU which operates almost identically to other tiers. It gathers usage statistics to determine its main banlist, maintains a council that votes on supplemental bans when the cutoff is not enough, hosts a room on Showdown, contributes analyses, and runs various tours and projects common in higher tiers. Since its resurrection this generation, it has remained active both in the Other Metagames forum and on the simulator, where it had an OMotM ladder and eventually a permanent ladder.</p>

<p>After a thread was started by the senior staff asking for input from many people related to PU, they decided that the evidence was enough: The time for a <a href="/forums/forums/.327/">PU subforum</a> had come. All of PU's old threads carried over and since its inception even more have been created, like a <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/pu-replays-thread.3527783">replay thread</a> and <a href="/forums/threads/.3527768">Survival of the Fittest</a>.</p>

<p>The tier is run by co-leaders WhiteDMist and Dell. Feel free to send them a message if there's a thread you'd like to start or visit the <a href="/forums/threads/.3527254/">Simple Questions, Simple Answers</a> thread for other questions.</p>

<h3>Other Metas Artwork</h3>

<p>There are a lot of great artists contributing to Other Metagames lately. Here are a few of the masterpieces created this last month!</p>
<br />

<p><em>Other Metagames Index art by Arhops</em></p>

<p>This piece represents our hectic behind-the-scenes part of the forum. A constant stream of Mr. Mimes are busy at work delivering reports to the co-leaders Eevee General (who reads them all) and The Immortal (who has Eevee General read them to him). Relics of an older age are buried among the paperwork, including the first ever Other Metas Constitution (smeared with ketchup by Birkal) and one of Arcticblast's memos to institute a citizenship test to gain entrance to our forums.</p>

<p><em>FU art by brightobject</em></p>

<p>This collegiate-inspired banner features some of FU's top threats, glowing with their inner&mdash;and often unappreciated&mdash;power. The tagline at the top, "The Best of the Worst of the Worst of the Worst," was picked up as a rallying cry around the world by underdogs underachievers alike.</p>

<p><em>Survival of the Fittest art by Bummer</em></p>

<p>Bummer is well-known for his contributions across the site, so when he took the time to invest in the new PU subforum with some artwork, people rejoiced. The wild west motif in the art he made for the new SotF thread recalls a nostalgic bygone era of Pokemon battling when trainers would brave the elements and battle face-to-face. Can't you just feel the sun sizzling on your cheekbones in this scene? Since then we've developed technology like the Pokemon Showdown! simulator, but this piece is a great reminder of where we came from.</p>

<p><em>PU Viability Rankings by Bummer</em></p>

<p>The second addition to Bummer's growing PU repertoire is a rowdy, honky-tonk ride with some of PU's most notable and notorious threats. Poliwrath controls the wheel, similar to its role in the metagame itself. The wily Kecleon is at his side, ready to shift its skin at a moments notice. Lickilicky, judging by its expression and slack tongue, is probably under the influence of Toxic. And the stone-faced Regice is wondering what he was doing on FU's public transit bus for so long before getting in the PU car.</p>
<br />
<p>Well that's it for our first issue! Tune in next month for what will only be another wonderful survey of the events coming out of Other Metagames! And remember, what you read in Other News may not be front-page news, but it's our news.</p>
