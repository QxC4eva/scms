Overview

_____________

- One of the most annoying Pokemon to fight against
- Access to Shadow Tag, one of the best abilities in the game, good synergy with CounterCoat
- Nice check to some Pokemon like Meditite, Knock Off-less Timburr, Snover, and pretty much anything that doesn't super-effectively hit it.
- Sadly, so much of the meta can break through it, due to the abundance of Knock Off, Yanma and Tangela just being too strongth.
- Still a nice safety blanket against some Pokemon, and Encore is just so helpful to have with Shadow Tag

name: Why Not?
move 1: Encore
move 2: Counter
move 3: Mirror Coat
move 4: Destiny Bond
ability: Shadow Tag
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
EVs: 76 HP / 132 Def / 212 SpD / 12 Spe

Moves
===============
- Encore to lock people into non-attacking moves like Stealth Rock or Defog, for free setup.
- Counter to counter physical attacks, as a part of the CounterCoat combination.
- Mirror Coat is for special attacks, completing the CounterCoat
- Destiny Bond is a cool last ditch effort.

Set Details

==============
- EV Spread gives optimal amount of HP/Special Defense/Defense for max surviability so you can counter things or have enough time to Destiny Bond it. Extra points go into speed for faster Encore/Destiny Bond.
- Shadow Tag
- Berry Juice or Evio is matter of preference. Berry Juice gives more potential to CounterCoat twice, but you really need Evio to take the more powerful hits (Gligar is a relevant example)


Usage Tips

=============
- Try to Encore non-attacking moves like Stealth Rock, then switch out for free momentum.
- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT USE TELEPATHY.
- Keep it as a failsafe against potential sweepers like Gligar
- You can create mindgames with them by threatening them with Destiny Bond, then using Encore if they try to avoid the Dbond with a non-attacking move.

Team Options
=============
- It's really good when you have a frail setup team, a good failsafe on some Offensive teams.
- Good when you need a reliable Meditite check.
- Really good partners include SS Dwebble and SS Tirtouga, as they love encore support and would like getting rid of the Fighting-types like Timburr and Meditite that Wynaut can dispose of.
- BD Swirlix loves it, Encore support+getting rid of Meditite.
- Anyone that appreciates Fighting-types like Pawniard love it too.
- Better on offensively oriented teams rather than stall.

Other Options
===========
- Tickle can work with a Pursuit user.

Checks and Counters
===========
- There isn't actually true counters to Wynaut, since outside of Volt Switch, U-Turn and Parting Shot nothing can switch into it.
- Using Wynaut is really risky against setup sweepers that can potentially outmindgame you, like Pawniard and Dwebble.
- Anything with Taunt kills it
- You just need to play around it, the best way to deal with a Wynaut is through smart play.
