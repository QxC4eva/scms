<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The overall aim of this team is to systematically remove Luke's counters to allow it to sweep late game, while hitting hard with things like CBzor, mixmence or CMcune to weaken their team, flygon scouting and revenge killing, and uxie making switches, adding SR damage. Late game, my last 2 pokes are 90% of the time Luke and flygon. If I can't sweep with luke, plan B is trying a flygon sweep.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Uxie</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Yawn<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Psychic</p>

<p>M Dragon, are u crazy? How can u use this thing? Use metagross, or swampert or azelf! Uxie sucks!
That is what people usually say when they see this thing for first time, but they are very wrong. Uxie is one of the best starters I have ever used, and it is key for the team's success. It is very bulky, and nearly nothing will OHKO it without a CH, which means that it will set up the rocks first turn most of the times, except:</p>
<p>· Fast sleep: 90% of the times it will be a roserade, and i can stay until uxie wakes up to set up the rocks, as i have just one poke affected by the TS, and roserade is gonna set up 2 TS ladders it doesn't matter whatever i do.</p>
<p>· Taunt: 2 options here: if it doesnt resist psychic, i will psychic to kill it, and i will return later to set up the rocks. If it resists psychic (azelf mainly), I will u-turn to flygon to get the kill with another u-turn and then return to uxie (if it has taunted, it won't set up the rocks that turn)</p>

<p>After setting the rocks, it has 2 important roles: fighting counter (annoying things like infernape, lucario or machamp can be stopped by this guy), and phazer / sleeper with yawn, allowing me to scout their team while getting some nice SR damage for the opponent's team. Yawn is an awesome move against sweepers that thing they can set up in uxie's face. U-turn is also very useful to pursuit those celebis / blisseys that stays in yawn because natural cure. Scizor and luke can take very well the bug, dark and ghost attacks thrown to Uxie</p>

<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 244 HP / 252 Atk / 12 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Pursuit</p>

<p>What can I say about this thing that you don't know? U-turn + SR destroys it counters, helping luke, since they have similar counters.
Early game I always u-turn while I can, and if I see a ghost that is faster than luke than could stop its sweep, it is a mindgame between Pursuit and Bullet Punch. I sometimes Superpower first turn. It is funny see how many heatrans / magnezones dies when i do that xd. Bullet Punch to clean late game.
200 HP makes it quite bulky, but im thinking i should make it bulkier and a bit slower. It works really well with uxie, as uxie attracts many CBtars, which means a free turn for CBzor. Fire attacks are easily stopped by mence, flygon or suicune</p>

<p><strong>Flygon</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- U-turn</p>

<p>I don't remember who told me a long time ago that Flygon was one of the most annoying pokes for other offensive teams, and he was right. Will I u-turn, or will I EQ to destroy your nape / magnezone? If my opponent mispredict with something like that, Im in a huge advantage (which means a dangerous poke for my team is death, or he has switched and i have u-turned to a counter, adding SR + u-turn damage, what can be annoying for him if he has switched to a SR weak thing)
An evil DDtar with the babiri berry wants to sweep my team after one DD? Is an empoleon or a metagross trying to sweep my team after an agility? NP! Scarfgon is here to save the day, revenge killing them.
If there is a key pokemon that makes the team be together, that pokemon is flygon. If flygon dies early game, winning that game is much more difficult.
After luke sweep (if it dies for whatever reason), flygon cleans.
I don't know if adamant would be a better option, because i feel with jolly it doesnt hit hard enough
Ice and Dragon attacks are stopped by Scizor and Luke </p>

<p><strong>Lucario</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Inner Focus<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Extremespeed<br />
- Crunch</p>

<p>This thing is a beast. It has sweept entire teams without any problems, and if the gyara of a stall is weakened, this thing can sweep the stall.
Midgame it sometimes appears to CC to see what counters of luke my opponent's has, or simply to destroy one of his pokes (if mence is the onlu thing that can stop it, for example, after CC damage + rocks, it won't be able to stop luke later when it gets a SD).  Lategame, if it gets a SD, it is usually gg.
Fighting and ground attacks goes to uxie, mence or flygon (not fighting ones)</p>

<p><strong>Salamence</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 16 Atk / 242 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Flamethrower</p>

<p>The stall destroyer. With a little bit of prediction, this beast can destroy a team, taking 2/3 pokes easily before dying. If a blissey comes in a outrage, suicune will sweep the stall very easily, if hippo / gyara / gliscor come in a Draco Meteor, luke will have a much easier time sweeping. 
If there is no SR, this thing is gonna be a pain for my opponent, as it has absolutely no safe switching (except cress, which is destroyed by scizor).
Ice / Dragon attacks goes to scizor or luke, while rock attacks goes to luke or flygon.</p>

<p><strong>Suicune</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Surf<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Hidden Power Electric</p>

<p>CMLOcune makes a comeback. Grizzly bear told me that it wouldnt work, but he was wrong. This thing is still a beast, and works pretty well destroying the celebi / zapdos switching, and i dont understand why people tries to stop it with breelom, just to be Ice beamed to death, or those that send scizor, just to die to a +1 Surf. It can very easily come against a gyara (specially those taunt leads) or heatran, and start his reign of terror, making a very good number against offensive / balance teams, and also stalls if bliss is weakened. This suicune is still a big surprise, and it works pretty well. 
Electric attacks goes to flygon, and plant attacks goes to scizor.</p>
