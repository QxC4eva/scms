[SHORT DESC]
Boost the power of attacks used consecutively.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the power of moves used consecutively by 20% each time it is used, up to a maximum of 5 turns (100%). If the holder switches out or uses another move, the boosts are lost. Metronome will not power up individual hits of multi-hit moves (such as Rock Blast) unless they are used consecutively.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Metronome isn't a good item. In competitive battling, Pokemon switch frequently, so gaining boosts will be hard. In addition, using one move repeatedly will put you at a disadvantage. Not to mention that even if you use the same move for four turns in a row, you only obtain the same power as a Choice Band or Choice Specsâ€”in fact, even if you used the same move six turns in a row, you would have done exactly the same amount of damage had you had the Choice item to begin with.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Wild Kricketune (5%).</p>
<p>Dream World (Windswept Sky - requires 7,500 points).</p>
