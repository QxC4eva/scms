Belly Drum
########
name: Belly Drum
move 1: Belly Drum
move 2: Fire Punch
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Thief / ThunderPunch
ability: Flame Body / Vital Spirit
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Atk / 252 Spe
ivs: 29 HP
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

• Belly Drum boosts Magby's attack stat to 68, letting it destroy the metagame.
• Fire Punch: Physical STAB, does enough at +6, especially under sun.
• Mach Punch gives Magby priority to use on Pokemon it would speed tie with or be outsped by, such as Meowth and Elekid.
• Thief allows Magby to steal items from difficult foes, like Chinchou, which it hits neutrally.
• ThunderPunch hits the water types that resist Flare Blitz super effectively.

Set Details
========

• Reaches 19 Speed, making it impossible for Pawniard to revenge it, barring the very rare and exploitable Choice Scarf Sucker Punch.
• 29 HP IVs allow it to activate Berry Juice immediately after using Belly Drum.
• Berry Juice grants it recovery, getting it back to full HP no matter what.
• Flame Body can cripple any Pokemon trying to use Fake Out to slowly kill it (Mienfoo, Meditite, Meowth).
• Vital Spirit lets it be one of the best Foongus switch-ins, and protects it from other sleepers like Gastly.

Usage Tips
========

• Bring in on something that can not threaten it, like Snover; keep in mind, however, that Magby is extremely frail, and will fall to most powerful neutral attacks.
• Other Pokemon to set up on include Larvesta, Mienfoo, and Pawniard.
• Will-O-Wisp is an excellent thing to switch in on, as Magby cannot be burned by nature of its typing.
• Belly Drum and sweep.
• It's okay to retreat, as switching it into a Fake Out can burn the foe, effectively neutering it; however, only do that if you have to.

Team Options
========

• Pursuit-trapping from the likes of Pawniard can facilitate a Magby sweep, as Ghosts are immune to its only form of priority.
• Defog or Rapid Spin support, as Stealth Rock hurts and Sticky Web neuters Magby.
• Sticky Web support is appreciated, as it prevents Diglett from switching in & killing with Sucker Punch; however, it is not required.
• Knock Off support: Magby has trouble sweeping past some stronger foes, like Chinchou.
• Magby draws status like moths to a flame, so a status absorber or cleric is appreciated as a teammate.
• Any way to weaken bulky Waters like Chinchou is appreciated; for example, HP Grass Chinchou can weaken Chinchou, and Mienfoo or Pawniard can Knock Off Slowpoke's Eviolite.


Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Cross Chop
move 3: ThunderPunch
move 4: Mach Punch
ability: Vital Spirit / Flame Body
item: Life Orb
evs: 236 Atk / 252 Spe
ivs: 0 HP
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

• Flare Blitz is Magby's most powerful physical STAB attack, and has immense power, especially under the sun.
• Cross Chop hits Munchlax and Porygon hard, as well as hitting Rock-types.
• ThunderPunch hits bulky waters and Archen harder.
• Mach Punch gives Magby priority, and OHKOs Pawniard while bypassing the Sucker Punch.

Set Details
========

• 252 Speed EVs and a positive nature allow him to reach 19 Speed, and bypass Pawniard's Sucker Punch. He can also speed-tie with or outspeed many common Pokemon, like Aipom, Pawniard and Mienfoo.
• The remaining EVs are put into Attack to let Magby hit harder.
• Life Orb lends Magby much more power, while 0 HP IVs cause him to only lose 1 HP per attack.
• Vital Spirit gives it a safe switch against Foongus and other Sleep-inducing Pokemon like Gastly.
• Flame Body lets it have a chance of burning a Fake Out or faster priority user as Magby goes down; however, Magby will only have 1 shot at this, as any attack will kill him after the recoil.

Usage Tips
========

• Bring it it safely, whether by means of a slow VoltTurn or a switch into a resisted attack, or by revenging something.
• Will-O-Wisp is an excellent thing to switch in on, as Magby cannot be burned by nature of its typing.
• Attack, attack, and attack some more.
• Don't be afraid to use Flare Blitz; Magby doesn't have to survive the whole battle.
• Don't switch in too often, as Magby is extremely frail.

Team Options
========

• Pursuit trapping defeats the Ghost-types that are immune to two of Magby's attacks.
• Defog or Rapid Spin support, as Stealth Rock hurts, and Sticky Web neuters Magby.
• Sticky Web support is appreciated, as it prevents Diglett from switching in & killing with Sucker Punch.
• MixKrow can soften up foes to allow Magby to get through them; Magby can do the same for Murkrow.
• Any way to weaken bulky Waters like Chinchou is appreciated; for example, HP Gras Chinchou can weaken Chinchou, and Mienfoo or Pawniard can Knock Off Slowpoke's Eviolite.

Other Options
########

• A mixed set consisting of Flare Blitz / Mach Punch / ThunderPunch / Overheat is usable, but Cross Chop is usually preferred over Overheat.
• A SubPunch set is decent, but Magby struggles to force switches and get a Substitute up.
• Vital Spirit can be used over Flame Body, but there are no sleep users who outspeed it outside of Sun, and Flame Body is very useful.

Checks & Counters
########

**OFFENSIVE PRESSURE**: If the opponent is going on the offensive, Belly Drum Magby will be hard-pressed to setup without significant team support.

**Sturdy Smashers**: Assuming no hazards are up, Pokemon like Tirtouga and Dwebble can survive a hit with Sturdy, recover, and kill with one or both of their STABs.

**Flash Fire**: If using Flash Fire, Ponyta and Growlithe can switch into Fire Punch or Flare Blitz, get a boost from Flash Fire, and in Ponyta's case, speed tie. However, both can survive a hit and OHKO back.

**Faster Pokemon**: Anything faster than Magby can kill it unless they are weak to Mach Punch, due to Magby's fragility.

**Hippopotas**: Takes negligible damage from LO, and can survive a +6 Fire Punch.

**Bulky Waters**: Bulky Waters defeat the Life Orb set; Slowpoke can take a ThunderPunch, and Chinchou can take a Cross Chop; however, they will be severely injured in the process.

**Diglett**: If its Focus Sash is intact, it can switch in, outspeed, and KO with Sucker Punch.
