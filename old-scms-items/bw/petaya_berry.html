[SHORT DESC]
Raises SpA by one stage when at 25% HP or less. One-time use.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder's HP hits or falls below 25%, this Berry will raise the holder's Special Attack by one stage. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes a 80 Base Power Poison-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This item is competitively viable; sets like SubPetaya (where a Pokemon uses Substitute down to 25% HP and then consumes the Petaya Berry to attack opponents with boosted special moves) can be deadly on specially offensive Pokemon, but render the Pokemon greatly susceptible to priority attacks from the likes of Scizor and Conkeldurr.</p>
