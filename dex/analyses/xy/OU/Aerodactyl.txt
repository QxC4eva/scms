Overview
########
Aerodactyl was a Pokemon oft seen as a sweeper. With base 105 Attack and 130 Speed as well as access to a decent movepool, Aerodactyl provided to be a threat in whatever tier it was welcomed into. The sixth generation brought our pterodactyl something new and menacing to those that mocked it before&mdash;a Mega Evolution. Boosting its Attack to base 135 and its Speed to a whopping 150 makes Aerodactyl so fast that an Adamant nature still allows it to outspeed base 130s and pack a powerful punch. Furthermore, the addition of Tough Claws as an ability boosts moves such as STAB Aerial Ace, Aqua Tail, Fire Fang, and Ice Fang. Its typing has also given it a blessing to resist both of Talonflame's STABs as well as STAB Quick Attack from Mega Pinsir.

Be aware of Aerodactyl's cons, in particular its weakness to Stealth Rock, weakness to common priority attacks such as Bullet Punch, Aqua Jet, and Ice Shard, and mediocre defenses. Despite having these drawbacks, Mega Aerodactyl proves that with an obnoxious amount of Speed, a solid base Attack, a wide movepool, and a great ability, a Pokemon can always strike "pterror" in whatever tier it can reside in.

Moves
========
Stone Edge is Aerodactyl's best STAB option and should be used as its main move, capable of hitting a good range of threats in OU very hard. Fire Fang is another required option that covers Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Scizor, as well as operating as a better move against Grass- and Steel-types thanks to Tough Claws boosting its power. In the case of Scizor, however, it is best to predict the switch to avoid the risk of getting get by an incoming Bullet Punch. Aqua Tail is used specifically to 2HKO common Ground- and Rock-type threats, especially Hippowdon, Gliscor, Landorus-T, Tyranitar, and Excadrill (which is already nearly KOed by Fire Fang anyway). Similarly, Ice Fang is a more powerful and accurate attack against threats such as Dragonite, Goodra, Garchomp, and Zygarde, and also hits Gliscor and Landorus-T harder than Aqua Tail. The boost from Tough Claws makes either move a very potent attack against Pokemon that resist Stone Edge or Rock Slide.

In the last slot, Aerial Ace is necessary to 2HKO Mega Venusaur and Conkeldurr, as well as OHKO Keldeo, Machamp, and Mega Medicham. It should be noted that after being worn down by either some entry hazards or a random attack, both Mega Venusaur and Conkeldurr don't stand a chance against a single Aerial Ace. Roost can be used to heal damage from Stealth Rock as well as other damage.

Other options include Rock Slide and Earthquake. Rock Slide has more reliably accuracy and has the benefit of a 30% chance to flinch the opponent. It is a viable option over Stone Edge, but can cause Aerodactyl to miss out on some potential KOs such as Mega Charizard X and physically defensive Zapdos. Earthquake is also a viable alternative over any coverage option to hit Jirachi and Heatran.


Set Details
========
Mega Aerodactyl is exceptionally fast and needs as much power as possible to attain KOs against its opponents. Therefore, simply maximizing Speed and Attack will yield the best results. An Adamant nature should also be chosen over Jolly; when Mega-Evolved, Adamant Aerodactyl naturally outruns a number of important threats, including +1 Jolly Mega Tyranitar as well as +1 Adamant Gyarados. A Jolly nature allows Aerodactyl to outrun Greninja, Alakazam, and Tornadus-T before Mega Evolving, though doing so decreases power.


Usage Tips
========
Aerodactyl's best switch-in opportunities include coming in after a revenge kill, or coming into predicted attacks such as Pinsir's Quick Attack, Earthquake, or weak Hidden Powers. Aerodactyl can also switch into Pokemon such as Talonflame (albeit moderately, as a Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird can deal considerable damage) thanks to its unique list of resistances. Also bear in mind that Aerodactyl is also immune to Trick with Aerodactylite and does not receive extra damage from Knock Off. If necessary, take advantage of these, but at the same time, don't be too reckless as both Aerodactyl and Mega Aerodactyl don't like taking too much unnecessary damage.

Additionally, ample prediction is the key to using Mega Aerodactyl offensively and effectively. Because it is fast and hard-hitting with a good list of coverage moves, opponents will often switch their Pokemon. Attempt to predict possible switch-ins when attacking early- to mid-game. If Aerodactyl packs Roost, don't forget to use that in defensive situations when possible and necessary. Predicted switches and Roost's side effect (taking away Aerodactyl's Flying typing temporarily) also give Aerodactyl opportunities to use Roost as well. Be sure to Mega Evolve as quickly as possible as otherwise you can be slower than Starmie and Greninja and OHKOed by Hydro Pump.

Team Options
========
Teammates mostly depend on the moves that are selected on Aerodactyl. It especially appreciates wallbreakers, and one great example of this is Kyurem-B, which can harass threats such as Rotom-W with Substitute and bust through walls and other dangerous opponents with Fusion Bolt, Ice Beam, and Earth Power. Rotom-W handles most Ground- and Water-types Aerodactyl can't KO in time, with the convenient plus of resisting priority moves aimed at Aerodactyl, such as Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Bullet Punch. Tyranitar is also a great teammate, as it can set up Stealth Rock and summon sandstorm, enabling Aerodactyl to stomach special attacks slightly better. Bulky variants also do well with absorbing Electric- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Aerodactyl if required, and appreciate Aerodactyl's ability to lure in and do huge damage to Mega Venusaur and Conkeldurr with Aerial Ace. Celebi can provide Stealth Rock support in addition to offering a resistance to Water- and Electric-types attacks and Heal Bell support. Keep in mind that teammates such as these have overlapping weaknesses alongside Aerodactyl, so it is recommended to pack additional teammates with an emphasis on defensive synergy.


As Aerodactyl is weak to Stealth Rock and appreciates as many attacking opportunities as possible, Rapid Spin and Defog are essential. For Rapid Spin, Starmie makes a good partner due to its great offensive presence and ability to weaken Water- and Ground-type counters, while Mold Breaker Excadrill offers some defensive synergy and takes care of the common Rotom-W. For Defog, Scizor and Latias are good examples, with the former also offering decent priority and STAB U-turn and the latter being able to sponge hits aimed at Aerodactyl. Zapdos and Mandibuzz also work, though keep in mind they share lots of common weaknesses with Aerodactyl. Zapdos in particular at least has the benefit of being able to handle bulky Water-types.


Other Options
########
Aerodactyl has a lot of option for and outside its Mega evolution. For attacks, Thunder Fang gets an honorable mention for bypassing Water-types in general, and Iron Head is its most accurate and powerful way of bypassing Fairy-types, although Stone Edge does nearly the same damage as a super effective Iron Headfactoring in STAB. Crunch and Pursuit can be used to hit or trap opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types, with the latter actually being useful as Aerodactyl can force switches.

As far as support options are concerned, Hone Claws can boost Aerodactyl's Attack and accuracy, which is good considering its reliance on Stone Edge. However, Aerodactyl struggles to find good setup opportunities, and the Attack boost is often not enough to break through some defensive threats. The combination of Taunt + Roost can be used to break through defensive cores and Pokemon, such as Skarmory and Blissey. Taunt also prevents opposing offensive Pokemon from setting up. Defog and Stealth Rock are potential utility options as well as Tailwind, although Aerodactyl may struggle to find free moveslots for these moves, as it is more suited for all-out attacking.

Choice Band and Life Orb can be used if your team requires a Mega slot. Unfortunately, if Aerodactyl holds either item, it can lose in situations that Mega Aerodactyl has an upper hand on. For example, Choice Band Aerodactyl fails to 2HKO 252 / 252+ Hippowdon, and it is much slower and its coverage moves are much weaker.


Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types**: Rotom-W, Slowbro, Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and other bulky Water-type Pokemon can shrug off many of Aerodactyl's attacks and threaten it with a burn from Scald or Will-O-Wisp. They must watch out for the occasional Thunder Fang or well-timed Stone Edges, although Gastrodon doesn't have this issue. Rotom-W also has the benefit of practically checkmating Mega Aerodactyl with Volt Switch, Hydro Pump, and Will-O-Wisp, though keep in mind that Stone Edge can potentially 2HKO it after Stealth Rock damage. Mega Gyarados also gets a special mention for being able to tank one Stone Edge and using this opportunity to set up with Dragon Dance or KO with Waterfall, although it is still outsped by Adamant Mega Aerodactyl after +1.

**Bulky Ground-types**: If Aerodactyl chooses not to use Ice Fang, Garchomp and Zygarde can switch into practically any attack and KO back with Stone Edge or STAB Outrage. Hippowdon also does the same if Aerodactyl lacks Aqua Tail, and even Slack Off the damage. Gliscor and Landorus-T can weaken Aerodactyl with Toxic and Intimidate respectively, although both must watch out for Ice Fang. Quagsire and Swampert get special mentions for not being bothered by any of Aerodactyl's moves at all.

**Steel-types**: While Aerodactyl has access to Earthquake and Tough Claws-boosted Fire Fang, they are unfortunately not enough to break through several Steel-types without proper prediction. Physically defensive Jirachi is 3HKOed by Fire Fang and barely 2HKOed by Earthquake, and can make Aerodactyl's life miserable by using Thunder Wave and/or Iron Head. Aegislash can also hamper Aerodactyl that do not hold Earthquake, being able to block and weaken Fire Fang with King's Shieldand threatening with Flash Cannon, Iron Head, Shadow Ball, and Shadow Sneak.

**Tanks**: Lacking Aerial Ace leaves room for punishment from the likes of Mega Venusaur, Conkeldurr, Machamp, Keldeo, and other Fighting- and Grass-types. Mega Mawile in particular can use Intimidate to weaken incoming attacks and proceed to outright KO with either Play Rough, Iron Head, or Sucker Punch. After Intimidate, Earthquake only does a maximum of 53% and Fire Fang 45%. Similarly, Azumarill isn't too bothered by most attacks saved for a well-timed Stone Edge and Thunder Fang and can use Aqua Jet to revenge kill or Play Rough to severely damage Aerodactyl on the switch.

**Faster Attackers**: Not much can naturally outrun Mega Aerodactyl save for some really fast Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Keldeo, Latios, and Garchomp. Aerodactyl's typing, however, leaves it extremely susceptible to common priority attacks, such as Bullet Punch from Lucario, Medicham, and Scizor, Aqua Jet from Azumarill and Crawdaunt, Ice Shard from Weavile and Mamoswine, and Thunder Wave from Prankster Thundurus and Klefki. Resisted priority attacks, such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, can even finish off a weakened Aerodactyl.

**Status and Entry Hazards**: Aerodactyl isn't particularly a fan of external battle conditions aside from sandstorm. Stealth Rock threatens to shave off a quarter of its health when it switches in, limiting its opportunities to attack or recover. Any form of status, especially paralysis, burn, and sleep, also severely hamper Aerodactyl one way or another.
