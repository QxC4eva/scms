[Overview]

<p>On paper, Sneasel might not look like a dangerous threat. It has low HP and Defense stats, and it's 4x weak to the common Fighting-type moves in the tier, moves that are often physical. Sneasel is also weak to the common Stealth Rock and its movepool is rather limited, with its best Dark-type moves being Pursuit and Bite. However, with the right tools Sneasel can actually become rather dangerous. Sneasel has access to a priority move in Ice Shard, and with an excellent Speed stat and a decent Attack stat, Sneasel can use Choice Band, Choice Scarf, and Swords Dance to great success. With Choice Band and Choice Scarf, Sneasel becomes a terrific revenge killer, and, with Swords Dance, it can pull off a late-game sweep.</p>

<p>Thanks to its high Speed and decent Attack stats, Sneasel makes a great Choice user, and is able to outspeed several Pokemon and revenge kill them. With Choice Band, Sneasel will hit hard, easily finishing off slower, weakened opponents. However, Choice Scarf makes Sneasel outspeed other Choice Scarf users, and can hit them before they hit Sneasel.</p>

<p>Ice Punch should be Sneasel's main attack, as it is the most reliable and most powerful move at Sneasel's disposal. Despite its low Base Power, Pursuit is the best Dark-type move Sneasel has, and it can trap weakened opponents. Brick Break hits Steel- and Water-type Pokemon, such as Aggron and Omastar, harder than any of Sneasel's other moves. Brick Break also hits Munchlax much harder. Ice Shard is a nice priority move that Sneasel can use to finish off weakened Pokemon that are faster, such as Choice Scarf and Shell Smash users, if Sneasel is using Choice Band.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Low Kick is an option over Brick Break, as it hits Aggron and Steelix harder; however, it deals less damage to Pokemon such as Omastar and Kabutops. Rapid Spin support is a must, as Sneasel will be switching around a lot. Of all the Pokemon with access to Rapid Spin, Kabutops and Hitmonchan pair with Sneasel the best. They both resist the Rock-type moves that Sneasel is weak to, and in return, Sneasel can sometimes take Ice- and Dark-type moves directed at them (physical ones will still put a huge dent in Sneasel). Something to take care of Fighting-types is really helpful for Sneasel. Moltres is an excellent partner, as it resists Fighting-type moves, as well as Bug-, Steel-, and Fire-type moves, and can hit back hard with its Fire- and Flying-type moves. Quagsire is also a good partner, as it can take care of most Fire-types in the tier, especially Entei, while Sneasel handles Grass-types well, which Quagsire has trouble with.</p>

move 2: Ice Punch

<p>While Choice Band will make Sneasel hit hard right off the bat, Swords Dance will make Sneasel hit even harder, and works well with its great Speed. Ice Punch packs quite a punch when boosted by Swords Dance, but Ice Shard is a nice option as well, being a good priority move to finish off faster opponents. Brick Break covers Steel- and Water-types that resist Sneasel's Ice-type moves; Ice and Fighting gives almost perfect neutral coverage, the only Pokemon resisting both types being Qwilfish and Slowking. Brick Break also hits Munchlax much harder than Ice Punch. Taunt makes setting up much easier and works great with Sneasel's Speed. However, Pursuit is also an option in the last slot for a secondary STAB move, and can hit pretty hard after some boosts, especially when the opponent is switching.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Low Kick is an option over Brick Break to hit Aggron and Steelix harder, but it does less damage to Pokemon such as Omastar and Kabutops. Substitute is also a great move to use in the last slot to protect Sneasel from status and make setting up easier. Substitute works great against Pokemon that need to rely on low accuracy moves to take Sneasel out. An Adamant nature is usable to let Sneasel hit harder, but that means it won't be able to outspeed positive natured Galvantula, Archeops, and Scolipede.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin support is welcomed to keep entry hazards off the field, keeping Sneasel's Focus Sash intact (if that is the chosen item). Kabutops and Cryogonal are both solid choices for this despite sharing weaknesses with Sneasel. Dual screen support can help Sneasel to set up easier; Uxie is an option that also resists the Fighting-type attacks directed at Sneasel. Both can also set up Stealth Rock, which is helpful as Sneasel may struggle to KO some Pokemon. Scolipede is another good choice, as it can set up both Toxic Spikes and Spikes. Moltres can really help in taking care of those pesky Fighting-types that threaten Sneasel. It can also take care of Bug- and Steel-types such as Scyther and Ferroseed, and it resists Fire-type moves. Quagsire can help to deal with Entei, which is a big threat to Sneasel. In return, Sneasel can easily take care of those Grass-types Quagsire has problems with.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sneasel's other options are few. Low Sweep is an alternative Fighting-type move, which has the useful effect of lowering the opponent's Speed stat. Sneasel also has access to Punishment, but it's really situational. It does work wonders against Shell Smash users, though. Knock Off is also viable to really screw with Eviolite, Choice Scarf, and Choice Band users.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Mach Punch is the easiest way to end Sneasel, as it is 4x weak to Fighting-type moves. Notable users of the move are Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee. Overall, Poliwrath is the number one counter to Sneasel, as it resists both of Sneasel's STAB moves and has the defenses to easily take a Brick Break. Poliwrath can then proceed to easily KO Sneasel with a STAB Fighting-type move. Entei has enough bulk to take a hit from Sneasel, and can easily KO it with Flare Blitz. Charizard and Moltres are two other examples of Fire-types that can easily take out Sneasel. Medicham will easily KO Sneasel with its STAB High Jump Kick and massive Attack stat. However, it needs to be careful of Ice Shard if it's at low health. Qwilfish resists both Ice Punch and Brick Break, and it takes nothing from Pursuit thanks to Intimidate. Quagsire has a good Defense stat and can easily take hits from Swords Dance Sneasel, as it ignores the Swords Dance boosts with Unaware. Quagsire also has access to Recover to restore the little health it loses.</p>
