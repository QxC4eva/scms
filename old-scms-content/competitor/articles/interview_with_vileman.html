<div class="aside">Why would they even have a Babies "R" Us in the middle of some jungle in Chile? “Argh, I'm late,” I thought to myself as I cut through the leaves and underbrush of the thick forest. Finally, I could see him sitting in the parking lot. How did they even make this? WHO COMES HERE!??
  </div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" />Hey, sorry I'm late; thanks for doing this!
  </div>
  <div class="speaker Vileman"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_vileman.png" />Haha, no problem.
  </div>
<div class="aside">He was wearing Wynaut Shades and seemed to be enjoying himself. These LC Players and their baby Pokemon...
</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" />Congratulations on winning the NU Open!
  </div>
  <div class="speaker Vileman"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_vileman.png" />Thanks a lot n__n I didn't really expect to get this far, but I'm happy I did.
  </div>
<div class="aside">I didn’t even have to ask if he thought he’d make it all the way. Haha.
</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" />Ah, you answered my next question too. Haha. How did you prepare for this tournament?
  </div>
<div class="aside">I was very interested, seeing as he is new to the NU metagame.
</div>
  <div class="speaker Vileman"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_vileman.png" />Well at first, I didn't knoww the metagame at all; all I did was build a team based on the Viability Rankings, and then got 2 more teams from friends.
  </div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" />So you did your research on the tier and went from there?
  </div>
  <div class="speaker Vileman"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_vileman.png" />Basically that, yes. I theorized a bit about what sets / Pokemon I wanted to use and built around that.
  </div>
<div class="aside">This was very smart answer. He did his research so he knew what was up. I can respect that.
</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" />Ah, interesting. Was there any team in particular that performed better than expected in this tournament for you?
  </div>
  <div class="speaker Vileman"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_vileman.png" />Yes, a team made by Rowan which was made pretty early in the metagame did outstandingly well; it has Pokemon that were hyped back then but not as much right now, such as Barbaracle and Choice Specs Dragalge. I think i used it throughout all of the Open and can remember it losing only 1 battle!
  </div>
<div class="aside">He used the same team during the entire open? Extremely impressive and risky, considering counterstyling and counterteaming are both very prevalent in these tournaments.
</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" />That's very impressive, especially considering that you used that team even in the Finals and won with it. How did you prepare for the Finals?
  </div>
  <div class="speaker Vileman"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_vileman.png" />Well the time lapse between the Semifinals and the Finals wasn't much; it was just a day. Haha. But before the Semifinals, I tested a lot with Iteddeh and JirachiCelebiMew, who are both amazing players; this helped me learn a lot more about underrated Pokemon and team archetypes which I could potentially face.
  </div>
<div class="aside">I smirked. #Hashtag No Johns.
</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" />All of that testing definitely paid off. So, seeing as you are an avid LC player, was it hard to transition from "the babies" to fully grown Pokemon?
  </div>
  <div class="speaker Vileman"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_vileman.png" />Haha well, I'm known for being a Little Cup player, but I've been playing other tiers for a while now (I started playing on PokeLab in 2010), so I am used to using Level 100 Pokemon.
  </div>
<div class="aside">So he did have a bit of experience. PokeLab started bringing back some nostalgia. Gotta stay focused, though.
</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" />Ah, so like you said before, you just had to find out the "best" Pokemon and movesets based on the Viability Rankings and then work from there? With your friends, of course, helping along the way?
  </div>
  <div class="speaker Vileman"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_vileman.png" />Yeah, lurking on the NU forums really helped me learn about good sets and about what was being used commonly in the metagame. My friends helped me improve a lot by helping me build and test teams.
  </div>
<div class="aside">Lurking? They don’t call him Vile for nothing. Hehe.
</div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" />Ah, and all that hard work has paid off! Once again, congratulations on winning the entire Open! Thanks for having me, man. Is there anything else you'd like to add before I go?
  </div>
  <div class="speaker Vileman"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_vileman.png" />Well I'd just like to say that NU was a much better tier than I expected; there are a lot of playstyles and Pokemon that are really fun to use. Shoutout to all my "frens" for all of the support you gave me throughout the Open :]
  </div>
  <div class="speaker aim"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_aim.png" />Alright, then. Thanks again for the interview, and hopefully we'll see some more great matches in the Ubers Open!
  </div>
<div class="aside">I thanked him before running as fast as I could; an Andean Condor was chasing me! Why is this the national bird? I could hear him laughing in the background. Finally, civilization! I boarded the next plane to New York and was gone.
