Overview
########

<p>The earth won't be the only thing quaking when Landorus enters the battlefield. Returning from the Ubers tier, Landorus has the amazing ability to go for either a specially or physically oriented set thanks to its great mixed attacking stats, and both are equally threatening. In fact, Landorus is quite difficult to counter until its set is discovered. On top of that, it has a very useful base 101 Speed, which, while not what it used to be, lets it outspeed Jirachi, Salamence, Mega Medicham, and other base 100s and below. Landorus also has abilities that go perfectly with each of its sets. Sheer Force making its special threats much more threatening, and Sand Force giving it a free Life Orb boost when used in sand. It also works very well with Volt Turn teams, as it has great synergy with Rotom-W and has access to a powerful U-turn.</p>

<p>However, Landorus does have a pretty major weakness to one of the best attacking types in the game: Ice. On top of that, the nerf to Hidden Power really hurt it, as it now has less of a chance of OHKOing Pokemon such as Garchomp with its measly 60 Base Power. Its main STAB, while powerful, does give free switch-ins to plenty of threatening Pokemon, such as Latios. Still, Landorus is an incredibly threatening Pokemon, and one wrong move against it can spell defeat for any unsuspecting player.<p>

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Earth Power
move 2: Focus Blast
move 3: Rock Slide / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: U-turn / Psychic
ability: Sheer Force
item: Life Orb
nature: Naive / Timid / Rash
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

<p>With Sheer Force, Landorus is able to enjoy the boost that comes with a Life Orb without having to take the recoil that normally comes with it. This makes Landorus one of the most powerful special attackers in the tier. Earth Power is an insanely strong STAB move, usually being able to at least 2HKO anything neutral to it. Even specially defensive Mega Venusaur will be taking a considerable amount of damage, and has a chance to be 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Focus Blast hit's Pokemon which are able to tank and Earth Power such as Tyranitar, Ferrothron, Skarmory, and Rotom-W. Rock Slide might seem odd on a special attacker, but it gets a boost from Sheer Force, making it almost as powerful as Stone Edge while being much more accurate. Rock Slide is good for hitting specially defensive Togekiss and Gyarados that lack intimidate. It also can 2HKO Dragonite, but Landorus needs 56 Attack EVs in order to guarantee the OHKO after Stealth Rock. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice hits opposing Landorus and Gliscor (which otherwise wall this set), Latios/Latias, Garchomp, Dragonite for the OHKO, and physically defensive Togekiss. The last slot is a matter of preference. U-turn is great for hitting Latios, Latias, and Celebi on the switch, and can also provide the team with valuable momentum, as Landorus forces a lot of switches. However, Psychic is great as a more reliable move than Focus Blast to hit Rotom-W, and scores a guaranteed 2HKO on Mega Venusaur.</p>

Set Details
========

    Naive if using Rock Slide, Timid for HP Ice
    Rash can be use for more power if speed isn't as necessary
    A bulkier EV spread can be used with a Rash nature, but it has good speed with Naive
    Life Orb is the best item for this set because SF cancels out recoil

Usage Tips
========

    Landorus can be used as a great pivot with U-turn
    Forces a lot of switches
    Can clean up late-game if checks are weakened (easier with U-turn)
    More importantly, it helps wallbreak for others (think: Keldeo)
    Works very well with Sticky Web support due to its naturally decent Speed and high damage output

Team Options
========

    Ttar makes a great partner for trapping Celebi, Latias, etc.
    Keldeo, Breloom, Garchomp, Lucario, etc., all appreciate walls being worn down or lured (Togekiss, Celebi, Latias, etc.)
    Forces a lot of switches, so hazards are helpful
    Also switches in a lot, so spinners like Starmie work well with it
    Works especially well with VoltTurn, so Scizor and Rotom-W make great partners

Rock Polish
########
name: Rock Polish
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Rock Slide / Hidden Power Ice
ability: Sheer Force
item: Life Orb
nature: Rash / Modest
evs: 68 HP / 252 SpA / 188 Spe

Moves
========

    Rock Polish boosts Lando's Speed faster than all common scarfers
    With Modest, SF, and LO, EP is ridiculously strong
    Focus Blast hits Skarm, Rotom-W, Ferro, etc., for 1-2HKOs
    Rock Slide hits Togekiss, Gyarados, Salamence, etc., for 1-2HKOs
    HP Ice hits Dragonite, Salamence, other Landorus, and Gliscor for OHKOs

Set Details
========

    Outspeeds positive base 80s pre-Polish
    Faster than Choice Scarf Latios after RP
    168 Spe EVs can be used to outrun Adamant Lucario and Timid Heatran, rest can go in bulk
    56 Atk EVs are needed to OHKO Dragonite with Rock Slide after SR, so they can be moved from HP if needed
    Again, LO is the best item to use here
    Calm Mind can be used over RP if boosting speed isn't necessary, though max Speed EVs and Timid should be used in that case.

Usage Tips
========

    This Pokemon is best used late-game
    It is wise to use Pokemon that share counters with it to wear them down more easily (i.e., Specs Keldeo)
    Sending it in early is fine as long as you don't try to sweep. Hitting a switch with HP Ice or FB can help a sweep later
    It is important to eliminate powerful priority users such as Azumarill and Mamoswine first before sweeping

Team Options
========

    Specs Keldeo
    Banded / Scarf Ttar
    Rotom-W (covers weaknesses well and has Volt Switch)
    Choice Band Scizor (with Pursuit)
    Scarf Genesect (can weaken counters and has U-turn)

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Hidden Power Ice
ability: Sand Force
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Naive
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Earthquake hits very hard off of 125 Attack
    Stone Edge forms EdgeQuake and hits Flying types that are immune to EQ
    U-turn is important for grabbing momentum on predicted switches
    HP Ice can hit Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor on the switch for 2HKOs

Set Details
========

    An Adamant nature can be used due to how uncommon Scarf base 100s are atm
    Expert Belt can be used to bluff the Scarf, which can help lure in Lando/Gliscor and nail them with HP Ice

Usage Tips
========

    This set is mainly used for momentum
    Use Earthquake sparingly, since it is easy to switch in and set up on
    Can be a good cleaner once all Ground resists/immunities are gone
    Appreciates hazards since it causes a lot of switches, especially with other VoltTurners

Team Options
========

    Tyranitar or Hippowdon are really nice to boost EQ and SE
    Works best on VoltTurn teams, so Rotom, Scizor, and Genesect are good partners
    Special setup sweepers that enjoy being able to switch in for free on physical walls appreciate its U-turn; Keldeo and Manaphy fit this role well

Physical Sweeper
########
name: Physical Sweeper
move 1: Swords Dance / Substitute
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Hidden Power Ice
ability: Sand Force
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
nature: Naive
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Swords Dance is good fro breaking walls
    Sub is better against offensively based teams
    Earthquake at +2 with LO and Sand Force hits like a truck
    Stone Edge formes a nice combo with Earthquake
    Hidden Power Ice is for Landorus-T and Gliscor
    Explosion can be used over HP Ice for a last minute attack for huge damage at +2

Set Details
========

    Max Attack and Speed to ensure outspeeding things like Jirachi, Charizard X/Y, and other base 100s and Adamant Mega Pinsir
    Life Orb is the item of choice for the extra power, but an Expert Belt can work if preserving bulk is important, but power might also be needed
    Leftovers can be used if increasing its survivability is key

Usage Tips
========

    Should be used either late game to sweep or early game to break walls
    It becomes surprisingly nice when it bluffs the special set with LO HP Ice, so opening with that can cause the opponent to switch in a special wall
    Eliminating priority users is key when using this set.
    SD should be used on teams that have trouble with defensive teams, sub should be used on teams that have trouble with offense
    Needs to force a switch in order to set up since its bulk isn't that great

Team Options
========

    Good lures to physical walls work well, Mega Garchomp is good
    Rotom-W covers all of Landorus's weaknesses well and provides Volt Switch support
    A Sand provider is almost necessary, as a free LO boost on EQ and SE is great

Other Options
########

    Gravity sets can be cool
    Double Dance sets are also cool, but usually done better by Lando-T
    Scarf Special set, but it misses the power from LO

Checks & Counters
########

    Depends on the moveset
    Celebi, Latias, Cresselia, Rotom-W take on the special sets
    Skarmory, Bronzong, Ferrothorn take on physical
    Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Slowbro can take on Scarf, but they have to watch out for a coverage move
    Mamoswine, Azumarill, and Weavile can stop any set with priority
