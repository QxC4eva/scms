<p>Welcome to the RMT Archive Index! The RMT Archive is a list of teams compiled with the goal of chronicling the course of a metagame as it evolves over time. In this archive, you'll find exemplary teams that either defined a playstyle, introduced an innovative threat into the metagame, or found great success, be it on the ladder or through tournaments. You might recognize some of the teams found in here through facing them on the ladder or seeing them in important tournament matches&mdash;the fame of some of these teams is a testament to the RMT Archive's goal of cataloguing the highest quality teams. We hope you enjoy the teams we've compiled; who knows, you might even see your team here some day!</p>

<p>You can find the two indexes we have for you to browse here: <a href="/rmt/archive/dpp">Gen IV Archive Index</a> & <a href="/rmt/archive/bw">Gen V Archive Index</a></p>
