Forces the target to switch to a random Pokemon.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and then forces the target out, dragging out another random non-fainted Pokemon on the opponent's team. This effect will not work if the target has a Substitute up, if the target used Ingrain previously, has the ability Suction Cups, or if the user faints immediately after using the attack (for example, if the user hits a Pokemon with Iron Barbs or is holding a Life Orb). Red Card does not activate if the holder uses Circle Throw. This move has a priority of -6.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Circle Throw acts like Roar and a damaging move mixed together. Its main advantage over other phazing moves is that it is able to work even under Taunt. It's a good option for mono-attacking sets, to avoid being phazed out. Keep in mind, however, that it has negative priority like Roar and Whirlwind.</p>
