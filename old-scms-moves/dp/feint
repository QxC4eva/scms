[SHORT DESC]
Only works if the foe uses Detect or Protect; nullifies effects of those moves.

[LONG DESC]
<p>This move only works if the target uses Detect or Protect. If the target uses one of those moves, this move does normal damage, and the effects of Detect or Protect are nullified for the rest of the turn. However, the use of Detect or Protect still applies to the internal counter, meaning they still have half the chance to work the following turn.
