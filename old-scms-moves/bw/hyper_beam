<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Provided the move hits, the user must recharge the following turn, and may not attack or switch.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>No matter how awesome Lance makes it look, Hyper Beam is a terrible attack; the only remote use it has is on Adaptability Normal Gem Porygon-Z in the VGC environment. As boosting with Nasty Plot is extremely difficult in doubles, the Normal Gem boost, along with the raw power of Hyper Beam, can give Porygon-Z an alternate way to plow through opponents. Beyond that, ignore Hyper Beam's wide distribution and huge Base Power; the coverage and recharge turn are terrible and, nearly any unresisted special STAB attack will do more damage over two turns.</p>
