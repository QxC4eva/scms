Overview
########
- Despite the mediocre stats, Klefki has an incredible combination of typing, movepool, and ability
- Capable of checking important threats such as Yveltal and Xerneas
- Easily finds opportunities to lay down layers of Spikes and resists the attacks of most commonly used Defog Arceus formes
- Prankster Thunder Wave lets it be a last ditch effort to stop dangerous sweepers like Mega Blaziken
- Has a low damage output meaning it is easy to use Rapid Spin on and Klefki can't do much to certain switch-ins

Moves
========

- Spikes are an excellent entry hazard to have on one's teams even with the buffed mechanics for Defog, especially for Klefki who has no difficulty in finding opportunities to use them
- Thunder Wave notably cripples Geomancy Xerneas but it can also cripple any offensive threat like Mewtwo, Mega Blaziken, or Mega Gengar
- Play Rough allows Klefki to break Geomany Xerneas's Substitutes thanks to the boost from Fairy Aura. It's also a reliable STAB move, although weak, and it has the benefit of being able to drop the opposing Pokemon's attack stat making Klefki that much more difficult to switch into
- Toxic cripples defensive Pokemon, notably Defog Arceus formes. It may appear to clash with Thunder Wave but generally one of the two status moves outclasses the other depending on the team archetype Klefki is playing against, simplifying the decision during play. 
- It's really hard to replace any move on Klefki's moveset as they all serve a significant purpose. If the roles one of those moves serve is already covered by a teammates, Foul Play is an option to punish physical attackers that attempt to take advantage of Klefki's uninvested and vulnerable physical defense.
- Rest can heal Klefki of status but it can't fit the move any more easily than it can fit Foul Play

Set Details
========

- Klefki's typing is more geared to checking special attackers like Yveltal and Xerneas making full investment in Special Defense the most optimal spread.

Usage Tips
========

- Klefki may not have much bulk but its typing and ability makes up for that by giving it wide array of resistences with few weaknesses as well as allowing it to use Spikes before getting hit or force an offensive Pokemon out with the threat of Thunder Wave. Take advantage of this to bring Klefki into play as much as possible so that it can find turns to lay down hazards.
- Burns are bothersome to Klefki as it lacks recovery making it more reliant on teammates to stall out a Toxic poisoned Pokemon. It also cripples Klefki's Play Rough but that is rarely relevent unless your opponent has a Geomany Xerneas and may be using Substitute on it.
- Don't be too wreckless with Klefki if your opponent has a means of removing hazards. Even if you manage to Toxic poison their Defog Arceus, a burned Klefki with smarter play can mean that your opponent's Defog user outlasts your Klefki's ability to lay Spikes.
- Against more offensive teams, Thunder Wave will be your status of choice. Defensive teams are much more bothered by Toxic meaning you should almost always only click that. Balanced teams tend to be more vulnerable to Toxic due to their reliance on things like Arceus but you will at times find yourself making a coin flip to decide which status to use. This is over-simplifying things but, in general, it's fairly clear from Team Preview which status move you are going to use the most.



Team Options
========

- Klefki is so full of utility and capable of covering so many roles that it doesn't really require any specific team support and can fit on just about any team
- Having a cleric is nice if you are using Klefki on a more defensive team as the game will last longer than otherwise and so a burn will have much more of an effect.
- Play Rough may have a high chance to drop a switch-ins physical attack but it's still best to have something like Landorus-T that can handle the physical attackers that are brought in to force Klefki out. 
- The less opportunities your opponent finds to use Defog, the less you have to rely on Klefki to reuse Spikes. Using fast Taunter and very powerful attackers can limit how often Defog is used, if at all, so that Klefki can do more than just redo what it just did.


Other Options
########

- Max special attack investment with Flash Cannon can also pop a boosted Geomany Xerneas's Substitute but it severely reduces Klefki's bulk and it's not difficult to protect Klefki from a burn if you suspect a Substitute Geomancy Xerneas.

Checks & Counters
########

**Excadrill**: Immune to both Toxic and Thunder Wave, resists Play Rough, can use Rapid Spin to clear Spikes, and can KO Klefki with Earthquake.

**Scizor**: Scizor is immune to Toxic and resists Play Rough making it very easy for it to come in on Klefki and Defog away Spikes. You might even see a Scizor setup Swords Dance on Klefki since Bullet Punch still outspeeds moves without priority even with Scizor paralyzed.

**Forretress**: Like Excadrill, Forretress is immune to Toxic and can use Rapid Spin to get rid of Spikes. It's also not bothered much by Thunder Wave and can setup Spikes of its own.

**Poison Arceus**: Poison Arceus is immune to Toxic, can burn Klefki with Will-O-Wisp, and Defog away any hazards.

**Shadow Tag**: Gothitelle can trap and remove Klefki while attempting a sweep after setting up on it, however it can't prevent Klefki from setting up three layers of Spikes. Mega Gengar can also trap and remove Klefki but it'll be paralyzed in the process and can't really prevent layers of Spikes, either. Wobbuffet can indirectly mess with Klefki by helping a Geomancy Xerneas setup and protect it for a handful of turns
with Safeguard. 
**Ground-types**: Landorus-T and Groudon can easily threaten to KO Klefki with STAB Earthquake while being immune to Thunder Wave. Gliscor is also immune to Toxic but its Earthquake is much weaker and will need prior damage to KO. None of these mons can remove any Spikes that are setup as they switch in. Gliscor and Landorus-T are at least immune to Spikes themselves.

**Ho-Oh**: Ho-Oh can switch in and destroy Klefki with STAB Sacred Fire. Although it dislikes Thunder Wave and Toxic, Regenerator and its large bulk means that it's not completely cripled, either. Ho-Oh can't clear away Spikes but it is immune to it.

**Clerics**: Aromatherapy and Heal Bell support can remove the status Klefki has spread from the opposing team and thus delay the death of their Defog user.
