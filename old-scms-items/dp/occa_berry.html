<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Fire-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed after use. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 power Fire attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Fire is a common attacking type, and as such, having a one time neutrality to it can be very helpful to Pokemon that only need to take that one hit to hit back harder. Steel-types with Earthquake are common users of Occa Berry, as it allows them to survive one attack from a Fire-type and retaliate with a super effective Earthquake. Common examples include Metagross in OU, and Steelix in UU.</p>

<p>The problem arises when taking these Fire Blasts and Flamethrowers that Steel-types generally tend to have low Special Defense stats, and so may take significant damage from STAB Fire special attacks even after the neutrality from Occa Berry is taken into account. Also, Pokemon that utilize Fire-type moves to hit Steel-types often also carry another move to hit Steel-types super effectively as well, as no one type of attack can hit all the Steel-types in the game for super effective damage; Heatran carries Earth Power, Infernape Close Combat, and Salamence Earthquake. This can often make the reliability of Occa Berry questionable, as the opposing Pokemon can just hit you super effectively with another move and effectively bypass the point of running a resistance Berry altogether.</p>
