[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a Normal-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%, even if the move hits for not very effective damage. This only reduces the damage of the first hit of a multi-hit attack. This item is consumed during the damage calculation. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Normal-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>It is extremely rare that there will be a reason to use the Chilan Berry over another item; it is extremely situational and somewhat gimmicky. The only reason to use the Chilan Berry would be to reduce the damage of Explosion or Selfdestruct, but Ghost-types are generally more useful in that respect. Sometimes the Chilan Berry might prove to be an OK option if you have to play with Item Clause (for example, under VGC rules).</p>
