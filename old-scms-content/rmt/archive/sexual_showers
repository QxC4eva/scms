<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/186.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Politoed</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Drizzle<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Scald<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Perish Song<br />
- Protect</p>

<p>The weather in play can easily decide the outcome of a match. Standard defensive Politoed has the most survivability, which allows it to supply rain the longest. Thanks to its bulk (and Dugtrio), this Toed usually outlasts opposing weather with ease. Toed also has the defenses required to help check threats like DD Nite and Scarf Terrakion. Scald is a reliable STAB which is further boosted by rain. Scald burns can be helpful in wearing down common switch-ins like Rotom-W and Lati@s. However, Toxic is is a more direct way to put switch-ins and walls on a clock. Once an opposing poke is badly poisoned, it can usually be stalled out by Tentacruel and Ferrothorn. Perish Song stops most Baton Pass chains cold, and is also used to psuedo-phaze set up pokemon like Sub Gyarados. Protect is useful for scouting, racking up status damage, and recovery. Even though 252 HP EVs puts Toed's at 384 (an even number, which is worse for hazards), it grants Toed 24 hit points from Leftovers rather than 383's 23.</p>

<p>I chose to go with a defensive Politoed set after testing Specs and 3 Attack. Neither of them seemed to fit the team. This set is much easier to switch in and bring up rain. Scald and Toxic are for status, Protect is for scouting, and Perish Song helps deal with some Pokes like +1 Dragonite. This Politoed set is the best at what it does, keeping up the rain for Tornadus. The EVs are to maximize his bulk - standard.</p>

<p><strong>Tentacruel</strong> @ Black Sludge<br />
Ability: Rain Dish<br />
EVs: 216 HP / 196 Def / 96 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Scald<br />
- Rapid Spin</p>

<p>SubToxic Tentacruel is an absolute monster. Next to nothing can stop this jellyfish from spinning. Bulky anti-spinners like Jellicent can be beaten easily with Toxic. Gengar is 2HKOd by rain boosted Scald. Substitute is the crux of the set, allowing you to stall out Pokemon you have already badly poisoned. Sub also blocks things like Ferrothorn's Thunder Waves and Leech Seeds, which makes spinning three hells of a lot easier. 216 HP EVs hits 355, which is an important number for SubCruel. Being nearly divisible by both four and sixteen, 355 is the highest HP number you can have without losing hit points to Substitute. Running 356+ results in subbing off more HP than you gain from two turns of Rain Dish+Black Sludge. Timid Nature in combination with 96 Speed EVs allows you to outspeed Jolly Mamoswine, Jolly Dragonite, Jolly Gyarados and Timid Heatran. The standard spread (the one TFL uses) ops for more bulk, which helps more with physical threats.</p>

<p><strong>Genesect</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Download<br />
EVs: 8 Atk / 248 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Hasty Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Bug Buzz<br />
- Thunder<br />
- Ice Beam</p>

<p>Scarf Genesect is the fastest mon on the team, and functions as our revenge killer. Gene also weakens the opponents team, scouts, and keeps momentum with U-Turn. Genesect U-Turns on its common switch-ins, like Terrakion and Heatran, which gives Dugtrio the chance to trap and kill. Although useful, momentum snatching U-Turn is not all Genesect is good for. I'm not exaggerating when I say Bug Buzz is a nuke. For example, after a Download boost, Bug Buzz can 2HKO Landorus and Scizor switch-ins after SR damage. Often times, it isn't Tornadus sweeping at the end, it's Download boosted Bug Buzz. Thunder and Ice Beam round off the set by granting Genesect perfect neutral coverage. I personally run Hasty nature over Mild to speed tie with opposing ScarfSect if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Dugtrio</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Arena Trap<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
IVs: 21 HP / 0 Def / 0 SpD<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Reversal<br />
- Memento</p>

<p>Dugtrio+Rain is one of the most hated combinations on the ladder. As already mentioned, Dugtrio can eliminate weather inducers like Tyranitar and Ninetales, making parts of the opponent's team essentially useless. Not only does Trio eliminate opposing weather, but it also clears the path for Tornadus' sweep by eliminating Steel types like Jirachi and Heatran. Dugtrio is the team's Stealth Rock user. Although it does not have a lot of opportunities to set up rocks, Focus Sash can guarantee them if needed. Earthquake OHKOs all Heatran, most Ninetales, and 2HKOs Tyranitar and Jirachi. Reversal does ridiculous amounts of damage, even coming from Dugtrio's weak attack stat. When TFL gave me the team, Trio's forth move was Rock Tomb. I ran with it for awhile, and it is great. But, Memento does the same thing; preventing the opponent from setting up. Dugtrio is an absolute perfect fit for this team, and is always a good mon to have in your back pocket. 0 Def / SDef IVs lets your opponent knock you down to 1 HP with ease, allowing you to abuse Reversal. 21 HP IVs puts you at 201 HP- two Seismic Tosses will leave you at 1 HP.</p>

<p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong> @ Chesto Berry<br />
Ability: Iron Barbs<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 SpD<br />
IVs: 0 Spe<br />
Sassy Nature<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Power Whip<br />
- Gyro Ball<br />
- Rest</p>

<p>Ferrothorn set ups additional hazards for Tornadus, and offers a reliable switch-in to powerful special sweepers. Because Ferro is so bulky, one of the most common ways to deal with it is burn. RestThorn's ability to peel burns (and para) is fantastic, and will allow you to strike with non-hindered attacks, or set up more. I like to think of Chesto berry as an 'extra life', because that's essentially what it is. A 7th pokemon. Major props to TFL for this powerful set.</p>

<p>If I'm using Ferrothorn, this is the set you'd expect from me. Spikes are an excellent hazard to use with Tornadus-T, since most of its counters are grounded. Power Whip and Gyro Ball are great STABs for coverage. And Rest + Chesto is to keep Ferrothorn healthy. Why am I not using Leftovers? Burns. The EVs give me a Special Defensive tank.</p>

<p><strong>Tornadus-T</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 8 Def / 248 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Hurricane<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>

<p>The ruler of rain, the chicken of legend; Tornadus-T. Very few Pokemon can live a Specs boosted Hurricane. U ulrede kno, this team is built to eliminate those mons, allowing Nadus to clean up. Focus Blast provides near perfect coverage with Hurricane, and hits pokemon like Tyranitar and Heatran on the switch-in. However, you should U-Turn most of the time, and trap them with Dugtrio. Sleep Talk allows Tornadus to function as a sleep absorber. Sleep Talk predicts better than you or I do, so I try to get Nadus put to sleep as soon as possible. Timid nature is used over Hasty or Naive, because Nadus has the perfect amount of bulk, and U-Turn is only for initiative. From full, Timid Nadus can live Scarf Lando's Stone Edge, and even after rocks, it can live ScarfGene's unboosted boltbeam.</p>

<p>Tornadus-T is the Pokemon the team was built around. The team supports it in weakening its counters and keeping Tornadus-T at maximum health. Thanks to Regen, it can take a hit or two when it needs to. Choice Specs Nadus is more reliable when it comes to killing and has a lot more longevity. Hurricane is the move you'll be spamming all game. U-turn is to keep momentum when you expect a switch that you can't hurt much. And Focus Blast is for coverage. I use Sleep Talk, because sleep inducers aren't uncommon and it nets a ton of surprise KOs.</p>
