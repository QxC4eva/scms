Overview
########
- One of the best physical and mixed walls in OU, as it has great bulk, reliable recovery, and checks or walls some very important threats like Char Y, Garchomp, CharX, Talonflame, and Thundurus.
- Amazing support with Sand Stream, SR, and Whirlwind.
- Pretty strong for a wall, with a good Attack stat and nice STAB.
- Slow.
- Has a bunch of common weaknesses.
- Often relies on Whirlwind to stop some set up sweepers, so weakening it is not that hard.


Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Slack Off
move 4: Toxic / Rock Slide / Whirlwind
ability: Sand Stream / Sand Force
item: Leftovers
nature: Careful
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Def

Moves
========

- Earthquake for strong stab and so frail offensive Pokemon can't set up on you.
-Stealth Rock to support the team. Hippowdon gets many opportunities to set them up due to its massive bulk which allows it to stay alive longer.
- Slack Off so Hippowdon can stay alive longer and preform it's role of checking certain mons.
- Rock Slide can break balloons.
- Rock Slide gets coverage on important targets (MPinsir, Talonflame, CharY)
- Consider Whirlwind if you feel you have levitating/dragons and the like covered.
- Whirlwind not only phazes out Pokemon that are bulky enough to take you on and boost but it is also nice to force Pokemon out to take more hazard damage.
- Whirlwind is listed first because Hippowdon needs to be able to phaze certain things out immediately, for example, Garchomp easily sets up on Hippowdon without Whirlwind or Ice Fang.
- Toxic is nice because it can cripple Mandibuzz, Rotom-W.

Set Details
========

- Max HP and max SpD to make Hippowdon as bulky as possible on the special attacking spectrum so it can wall mons like Thundurus, Mega Charizard Y, Aegislash, Latios, Latias, Deoxys-S, Gengar, and Tornadus-T. The remaining is tossed into defense.
- Leftovers provide passive recovery without Hippowdon needing to do anything but be in battle. This could be the difference between being 2 or 3HKO'd.
- Nature is careful to boost SpD. Careful is recommended because by using Sassy you lower your speed. This is important because you could potentially win speed ties vs. other Hippowdon and get up your Stealth Rocks or Slack Off.
- Sand stream is slashed first because it allows hippo to check CharY, which is one of its main selling points. Sand Force is still viable if sand really hurts you more than helps you.

Usage Tips
========

- Hippowdon is significantly less bulky on the special side than his physical side so be wary of what you're about to send it in on.
- Be careful of Pokemon with the potential to carry Taunt in their moveset as they completely shut Hippowdon down.
- Abuse Hippowdon's ability to get in battle many times to keep Stealth Rock on their side.
- Hippowdon can still use his physical bulk even though it isn't invested, so switching in on weaker physcial attacks is fine.
- Keeping hippo healthy is important since it will most likely always move second.
- Use hippo's sandstorm to your advantage, for example, mega pokemon cannot hold leftovers, so the residual damage is especially annoying for pokemon like Mega-Venusaur. This makes pokemon like Keldeo, Thundurus, Mega-Mawile, and Rotom-W good teammates for hippowdon since they all like a weakened Megasaur.


Team Options
========
- A way of controlling hazards on your side, such as Defog, is appreciated as Hippowdon can potentially be 2HKO'd by needing to take hazard damage and then 2 hits from the opponent. Hazards wear hippo down fast so a defogger is appreciated like scizor or latias.
- Hippowdon mainly needs team support to take Ice, Grass, and Water attacks as well as super strong special attacks like Choice Specs Draco Meteors. Celebi can do this well, as can Latias, but be wary of stacking weaknesses.
- Pokemon that can take hits from very powerful physcial attackers like Choice Banded Terrakion, Mega-Garchomp, etc. are good team mates.
- Spikes and Toxic spikes work well with Hippowdon's whirlwind.
- Sand rush excadrill and Mega-Garchomp are some of the best partners for hippowdon since they love the sand it brings. Beware of stacking type weaknesses though.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Slack Off
move 4: Toxic / Rock Slide / Whirlwind
ability: Sand Force / Sand Stream
item: Leftovers
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

Moves
========

- Earthquake provides a strong stab option that keeps any offensive Pokemon from setting up on it.
- Earthquake also hits many of the Pokemon that Hippowdon walls for super effective damage.
- Stealth Rock is good on a Pokemon like Hippowdon since it gets many switch in opportunities and can heal itself throughout the match, allowing it to lay Stealth Rock multiple times in a battle. Which is important in this metagame with the introduction of Defog removing hazards.
-Ice Fang hits the Pokemon that Earthquake cannot, like Salamence, Dragonite, Landorus-T, Mega-Pinsir, etc.
- Whirlwind for phazing out Pokemon that don't care about Earthquake, such as Gyarados, Talonflame, etc.
-Whirlwind also works well with the Stealth Rock that Hippowdon provides.

Set Details
========
- 252 HP and 252 Def give it as much bulk as possible so it can preform it's role. The remaining 4 are tossed into SpD.
-Leftovers is the item of choice to give Hippowdon recovery at the end of every turn without needing to do anything so it can stay in battle longer.
- Impish Nature is chosen to maximize Hippowdon's physical defense while also lowering a stat he doesn't need.
-Sand Force is slashed first because Hippo is normally picked up for its utility, reliable recovery, and great bulk and sand is normally a hindrance to your team.

Usage Tips
========

- Use if your team lacks Stealth Rock and would appreciate a bulky Pokemon to check physical threats like Terrakion, Dragonite, Garchomp, Talonflame, etc.
-Bring Hippowdon in against any physical threat that you can deal with by using your attacking moves or whirlwinding.
- Use Hippowdon's massive bulk to get it in battle lots so you can always have Stealth Rock on the field.
- Be wary of what your opponent has, as many common hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Deo-D, etc. can all set-up hazards on Hippowdon.
- Keeping hippo healthy is important since it will most likely always move second.

Team Options
========

- A way of controlling hazards on your side, such as Defog, is appreciated as Hippowdon can potentially be 2HKO'd by needing to take hazard damage and then 2 hits from the opponent.
- Pokemon that can handle the Pokemon that beat Hippowdon such as Gyarados when Hippowdon doesn't have whirlwind, Taunt+Bulk-Up Talonflame, etc. are appreciated. A good example of this is Rotom-W, which can also come in on water attacks directed at Hippowdon.
- Along with bulky Pokemon that can handle Hippowdon's checks and counters, other Pokemon enjoy Hippowdon's presence. Many offensive Pokemon like the Stealth Rock Hippowdon brings, so things like Latios, Mega-Mawile, and other strong offensive Pokemon make good partners.
- Celebi has good type synergy and takes special attacks that Hippowdon cannot.
- Sand rush excadrill and Mega-Garchomp are some of the best partners for hippowdon since they love the sand it brings. Beware of stacking type weaknesses though.


Other Options
########

- Ice Fang for Breloom, Garchomp, etc.
- Smooth Rock will keep your sand up longer if your sweepers rely on that to do damage (Excadrill or MChomp)
