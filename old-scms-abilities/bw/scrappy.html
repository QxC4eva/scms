<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Scrappy allows the wielder's Fighting- and Normal-type moves to hit Ghost-types. Fighting- and Normal-type moves from a Pokemon with Scrappy are considered neutrally effective, and still take secondary type resistances into account (for example, Fighting-type moves from a Pokemon with Scrappy are not very effective against <a href="/bw/pokemon/drifblim">Drifblim</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/gengar">Gengar</a>).</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Scrappy is a good ability, but nothing can really take advantage of it in the upper tiers. <a href="/bw/pokemon/miltank">Miltank</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/kangaskhan">Kangaskhan</a> can be usable Pokemon but <a href="/bw/pokemon/snorlax">Snorlax</a> generally outperforms both of them. Other Pokemon that Scrappy is available to, such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/swellow">Swellow</a>, would much rather have <a href="/bw/abilities/guts">Guts</a> than Scrappy, so it doesn't see much use in the upper tiers.</p>
