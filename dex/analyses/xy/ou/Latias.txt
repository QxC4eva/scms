Moves
========
- One of the best users of Defog on offensive teams due to its excellent typing, bulk and Speed
- Differentiates itself from Latios with its greater bulk and Healing Wish
- Draco Meteor is Latias's most powerful STAB attack, dealing a large amount of damage to - Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Charizard Y
- Roost is used to allow Latias to check threats such as Keldeo and Rotom-W more reliably
- Healing Wish allows Latias to completely heal a weakened teammate once its job of removing entry hazards is done and is a major factor differentiating Latias from Latias
- Thunderbolt is the best option in the final slot to hit Gyarados, Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Azumarill for super effective damage.
- Psyshock is used as a secondary STAB option, hitting specially defensive Fairy-type Pokemon and Mega Venusaur much harder than latias's other coverage moves

Set Details
========
- Life Orb is used to give Latias a power boost to compensate for its only-above-average Special Attack
- Leftovers can be used, but being able to hit hard right off the bat is far more important on the offensive teams where this variation of Latias fits
- EVs and nature are standard
- Alternate spread of 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 Spe could be used to give Latias slightly more bulk and still allows it to outspeed Mega Pinsir
- Hidden Power Fire can be used as an alternative coverage move

Usage Tips
========
- Latias can generally function well in any point of the match due to the utility of Defog and Healing Wish
- Functions better on more offensive team, but is still functions well on balanced teams
- Pursuit trappers and Pokemon with the ability defiant are generally troublesome to Latias, so it is best to have these Pokemon eliminated before bringing Latias in

Team Options
========
- Heatran is an excellent partner for Latias, as it does well against Fairy- and Steel-types that generally threaten it, while also appreciating Healing Wish's recovery effect due to its lack of reliable recovery
- Choice Band Talonflame is an excellent partner, as Latias can remove Stealth Rock and heal it with Healing Wish
- Scizor is a great partner, as it can provide momentum to Latias with U-turn and shares great defensive synergy with it
- Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Conkeldurr are great partners to defeat Steel- and Dark-types that give Latias trouble
- Dragonite appreciates Stealth Rock being removed and appreciates Healing Wish's recovery effect, giving it a second chance to sweep
