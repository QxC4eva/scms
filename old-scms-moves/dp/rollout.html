[SHORT DESC]
Doubles in power with each hit. Repeats for five turns.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Doubles in power with each consecutive hit. Locks the user into it for five turns, but ends if the move doesn't hit or the user can't use it. If the user selects Rollout after the last turn, the Base Power resets. Using Defense Curl before Rollout doubles its Base Power for as long as the user stays in the battle.
