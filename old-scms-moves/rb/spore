Puts the target to sleep.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Puts the target to sleep.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The best sleep inducing move in the whole game, which is saying something. Too bad the Pokemon that get it, Paras and Parasect, utterly suck. Sleep is a very powerful status, so if you decide to use Parasect in UU, you can put an opponent to sleep, paralyze another, let Parasect faint, and call it a good day.</p>
