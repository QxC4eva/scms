<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Air Slash is pretty much the single most reliable special Flying-type attack around, not counting Aeroblast, or Hurricane inside the rain. It's pretty weak though, as 75 Base Power is a far cry from Hurricane's 120 Base Power. Nevertheless, it is a key move for special Flying-types such as Yanmega and Sigilyph. However, the killing feature behind Air Slash is its 30% flinch rate, which if you are faster essentially means that you have almost a 1 in 3 chance to stop the opponent from doing anything that turn, which can be game-changing if it occurs at the right time. However, some Pokemon can take this to extremes. Togekiss and Shaymin-S both have Serene Grace for their ability, which doubles the flinch chance to 60%. Thus, the odds of the opponent doing nothing in a turn are the same odds of Hypnosis hitting its target. While Shaymin-S can rely on its high Speed to achieve this game-winning formula, Togekiss must rely on bulk and Thunder Wave—a nasty surprise which brings the odds of the opponent doing nothing to 68%—to perform the same trick.</p>
