<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This team was originally created to counter a majority of the Shaymin users in the early stages of the Platinum metagame. Ironically, it utilizes Shaymin to accomplish its goal. Limitless and I have used this team with success on Shoddy Battle, attaining a rating of 1650 and 1660, respectively. This post basically retires the team due to its predictability on the ladder. Since the initial intention was to surprise people, it would be better to make an entirely new team.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of this team was its element of surprise. In the dawn of the Platinum metagame, lead Scarf Heatrans and Shaymin were quickly knocked out by Shaymin. Other common leads have trouble with Scarf Shaymin, bar Tyranitar and Bronzong. Each Pokemon has their own role in taking out or setting up on specific Pokemon. Their typing forms a vast network of resistance that can handle almost every offensive threat. The role of each Pokemon is explained in the team work section.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Shaymin-S</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Serene Grace<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Seed Flare<br />
- Air Slash<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>Scarf Shaymin has unparalleled speed. Since this variation can't overwhelm its counters, it is used as an anti-lead and late-game sweeper. Aside from Air Slash, which can occasionally chain flinches, it isn’t meant to be staying power (more like a trump card). Seed Flare 2HKOs Zapdos with Stealth Rock in play, providing a special defense drop is applied. Earth Power is mainly for fooling Heatran and Hidden Power Fire takes care of Scizor, Skarmory, ect.</p>

<p>This is a standard EV spread. There is enough speed to outspeed Timid Scarf Gengar and Deoxys. It has max speed to tie other Scarf Shaymin.</p>

<p>Shaymin takes care of many common leads, such as Gengar, Deoxys, Heatran, Machamp, Yanmega, Salamence, ect. Despite having a lack of versatility, it functions well in the late-game atmosphere. Shaymin can rip through weakened teams to close the game safely. Along with Heatran, the duo work well by covering each other’s weaknesses and resetting their attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Mamoswine</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Snow Cloak<br />
EVs:  4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Ice Shard<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>Mamoswine’s main function is to set up Stealth Rock. After that, its role varies based on the situation of the match. Stone Edge is useful damage to get on Rotom or Zapdos. Ice Shard tames Salamence and other threats like Shaymin. Earthquake works great against Adamant Lucario, non-Scarfed Heatran, and Tyranitar.</p>

<p>The EVs are standard once again. Jolly nature allows me to outspeed Adamant Lucario and defensive Zapdos.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is a vital part of helping my sweepers clean up late-game. Along with Heatran, it covers Zapdos that threaten Shaymin. The Electric-type resistance is huge for absorbing Thunderbolt, Discharge, and Thunder Wave. Without immunity to those moves, it’s difficult to fend off Blissey, Cresselia, Rotom, and others. Mamoswine is also useful for revenge kills against things a variety of different Pokemon. He is usually a safe switch against Salamence and comes in to give Dugtrio, Tyranitar, and Shaymin problems.</p>

<p><strong>Infernape</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Blaze<br />
EVs: 24 Atk / 252 SpA / 232 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Hidden Power Ice<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Grass Knot</p>

<p>Infernape is the wall breaker on this team. Many teams find themselves in a pickle confronting this guy after their Pokemon have been weakened. Close Combat covers Blissey and does a significant amount of damage to many neutral Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice takes care of Gliscor and Salamence without a Scarf or DD. Fire Blast is usually the attack of choice since it does a number on Zapdos, Rotom, and Skarmory. If Cresselia has seen anything more than 1 SR, then it can’t typically switch in on an Infernape’s Fire Blast. Grass Knot offers important Water- and Ground-type coverage to an extent. Its main use is against Swampert and weakened Hippowdon and Milotic.</p>

<p>Infernape gets just enough speed EVs to outspeed everything in or below the 105 base stat range. Max special attack and the rest of the EVs are thrown into attack. Pretty standard.</p>

<p>Infernape tends to be the star of the show, especially against defensive teams. Teams without an effective counter tend to switch around to weaken Infernape with Life Orb recoil. Infernape does his job mid-game to clear a path for Shaymin or Heatran.</p>

<p><strong>Zapdos</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 220 Def / 36 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Heat Wave<br />
- Roost<br />
- Hidden Power Grass</p>

<p>Zapdos really got a major boost from all of the Platinum updates with the addition of Heat Wave. Hidden Power Grass is for the obvious Swampert, which my team does not like in stall wars. This spot used to be held by Scizor, however with so many Heatrans present, it kind of was a nuisance.</p>

<p>The EV’s are fairly standard for the Calm variant. I wanted a more defensive approach to fill in all the loose gaps that were inhibiting our team. I can’t really say much about the EV’s, why reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>Zapdos brings a unique sense of role play when it comes to its team work. It makes sure that certain pokemon don’t get free set ups for a sweep. Many times Zapdos saves my ass against many Lucarios, Scizors, etc. With many of them running rampant in this metagame, Zapdos seemed like a staple. Heatran before, used to be my only lines of defense against opposing Scizors. I quickly changed this after many of the Scizors Superpowered right off the bat.</p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Hidden Power Ice<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Explosion</p>

<p>Like for most teams Heatran gives speed and resistances all in one. Fire Blast is for Stab and the occasional Flash Fire bonus. Hidden Power Ice for the obvious Dragons and for any time that I don’t feel like risking a accuracy hax miss from Fire Blast. Explosion is for last case scenarios.</p>

<p>Once again, I went very standard when it came to the EV’s. I went with max speed due to the fact that I want to out speed all other Heatrans. Max Special Attack was an easy choice also since I don’t really want to invest too much in Explosion when my main primary attacks will be Special.</p>

<p>Heatran also provides protection against the ever so popular Scizor and somewhat protection against Lucario. While being able to withstand Ice Shards from countless counters to Skymin, he is a pokemon that I rely on a great deal of the time for revenge killing and stuff of the sort.</p>

<p><strong>Kingdra</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sniper<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Outrage</p>

<p>I must thank all of you who don’t use Substitute on Kingdra. For I get off so many Subs. when people try to status Kingdra whether it be for burn, sleep, or paralysis. It also shields me from the ever so popular Ghosts trying to use Trick on Kingdra when I am setting up. Dragon Dance, Waterfall, and Outrage are self explanatory. </p>

<p>I probably could have put a little bit of EV’s into HP, but I just felt that I needed the extra speed to speed tie Scarf Heracross. While Speed is important, Attack is just as harmful on the offensive end. For after a Dragon Dance, Outrage can deal a whole load of damage.</p>

<p>Kingdra is really the meat of the team. I use it to soften up my opponents team so that the rest of my sweepers can well… sweep. If I don’t get Kingdra to at least sweep 2-6 pokemon, I have a much harder time winning the game. Obviously prediction and timing is key for Kingdra to sweep effectively. As I said before, Substitute is really what makes this set work.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After weeks of abusing this team, we have finally come to a broken road. Our prized anti-metagame team was finally coming to a halter. For you see, through these few weeks, we have acknowledged the fact that anti-metagame teams actually do work. However, only until the metagame shifts back. As with Husk's offensive team, most of the counters that we have listed are revenge killed. Most of you know that offensive teams rely soley with resistances and the users ability to effectively use the team. I urge all of you to try out this team, though not as effective as before, to see as Husk said, how offensive teams can still be effective.</p>
