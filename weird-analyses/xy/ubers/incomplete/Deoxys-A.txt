Overview
########

    Unparalleled wallbreaking ability with 180/180 offenses.
    Huge movepool, works great as a pure attacker or offensive lead with Stealth Rock.
    150 Speed is enough to outrun pretty much everything unboosted.
    Horrible defenses make it easy to revenge kill with priority/Scarfers.
    Can't switch into any direct attack, so getting it into battle can be difficult.



Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Psycho Boost
move 2: Low Kick / Superpower
move 3: Knock Off / Ice Beam
move 4: Extreme Speed / Hidden Power Fire
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Rash

Moves
========

    Psycho Boost OHKOes things like crazy.
    Aside from Psycho Boost, pick the coverage moves that work the best for your team.
    Low Kick takes care of Tyranitar, Dialga, and Ferrothorn and hits for 120 BP vs most Ubers. Pairs better with other physical moves such as ESpeed since it doesn't drop Attack.
    Superpower does more to lighter targets such Jirachi and nails Blissey for a OHKO. Preferred if you are using mostly special attacks since it crushes the pink blobs.
    Knock Off destroys Aegislash (who is KOed by Knock Off + Psycho Boost), Jirachi, and Bronzong, does a solid amount to Lugia/Giratina, and generally harasses walls by removing their items.
    Ice Beam wrecks Yveltal switch-ins and provides more consistent damage vs. Lugia.
    Extreme Speed provides mid-game revenge killing utility and gives Deoxys-A a way to take out weakened priority users and Scarfers. It also messes with Sucker Punch for things like Yveltal.
    Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Mega Scizor, which can be important as Mega Scizor forces Deoxys-A into a checkmate position with Bullet Punch if it stays in and Pursuit if it switches out.
    Thunder Punch can also be used in the last slot to hit Yveltal and deal good damage to Ho-Oh and Kyogre without resorting to Psycho Boost. It is however not as broadly useful as the other moves.


Set Details
========

    Always max Speed and SpA. No point in doing anything else since Deoxys-A can't take any hit.
    Naive outruns neutral Scarf base 90's and Mega Mewtwo Y, Rash gives its attacks more punch while still outspeeding regular Mewtwo and Mega Gengar.
    Focus Sash can work on this set if you want to use it as a lead since it guarantees Deoxys-A will survive one hit.


Usage Tips
========

    Works best on offensive/bulky offensive teams that need a strong wallbreaker.
    Be mindful of when you can bring it in. Use VoltTurn, coming in on non-attacks like Defog, or double switches. You can also bring it in when one of your own Pokemon is KOed to take back the momentum.
    Once it is in, just use the appropriate move for what you think your opponent will switch to.
    Don't be afraid to spam Psycho Boost if your opponent has no Dark-types.


Team Options
========

    The best support you can give this thing is Pokemon that help get it into battle. Things that can use U-turn or Volt Switch like Landorus-T, Scizor, Zekrom, or Forretress are wonderful partners.
    Have Pokemon that can cover the things you don't have a coverage move for. Fairies are great partners for taking on Yveltal, Zekrom can take on Lugia, bulky Grounds like Lando-T work well against Aegislash if you don't have Knock Off.
    Have switch-ins to the common priority users. Support Arceus with Will-O-Wisp can work decently against EKiller, Giratina-O, and Rayquaza, Fire-types and Dialga can handle Scizor, Fairies again can handle Yveltal.
    Wobbuffet can trap and KO common Scarfers.
    Geomancy Xerneas is a solid partner regardless of what you run on Deoxys-A since it checks Yveltal and Deoxys-A tends to lure in and heavily damage its checks.



Sash Lead
########
name: Sash Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock / Spikes
move 2: Psycho Boost
move 3: Grass Knot / Superpower
move 4: Taunt / Extreme Speed
item: Focus Sash
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========

    Deoxys-A can set up Stealth Rock pretty reliably since it forces switches and is fast.
    You can also set up Spikes if you already have a Stealth Rock user.
    Psycho Boost does a lot to Defog support Arceus and is generally useful to inflict tons of damage on anything that doesn't resist it.
    Grass Knot inflicts massive damage to Defog Rock/Water Arceus (the most common Defoggers), Kyogre, and Groudon.
    Superpower is great against lead Dialga and Tyranitar and still hurts Rock Arceus.
    Taunt blocks Defog.
    Extreme Speed limits Deoxys-S to one hazard and breaks Ho-Oh's Substitute.
    Not slashed but Hidden Power Fire can be used since it is good against Skarmory and Forretress and explodes Scizor.


Set Details
========

    Max out speed and offenses as usual.
    Naive is preferred since you want to be fast.


Usage Tips
========

    Works best on HO teams.
    This set is not hard to use - just set up Stealth Rock and massively damage the opponent's Pokemon before going down. If the opponent sends in a Defogger, Taunt them or blast them with the appropriate coverage option.
    Works best as a lead, but can be saved for early-mid game if necessary since it hits hard and is fast.


Team Options
========

    Doesn't require a lot of support, meant to be used with sweepers that benefit from early hazards like EKiller, Rock Polish or Double Dance Groudon, and Mega Blaziken.
    Geomancy Xerneas is a great partner since it can set up on most Defoggers if Deoxys-A failed to damage them before going down.
    Ghost-types such as Giratina-O or Mega Gengar are helpful since they block Rapid Spin, although Rapid Spin is very rare nowadays.
    Dialga provides Stealth Rock support (letting Deoxys-A run Spikes) and can heavily pressure most Defoggers with STAB Draco Meteor/Flash Cannon and Thunder.



Other Options
########

    Dark Pulse hurts the things you would use Knock Off on for more consistent damage and has a handy 20% flinch rate.
    Rock Slide OHKOes Ho-Oh.
    Meteor Mash severely damages Fairies.
    Psyshock is an alternative STAB that doesn't drop special Attack and 2HKOes pink blobs and Ho-Oh, but it is much weaker than Psycho Boost vs most other targets.
    Pursuit is neat since Deoxys-A forces switches and enables it to revenge-trap Mega Gengar.
    Thunder hits Kyogre/Ho-Oh/Yveltal/Lugia in one move.
    Zen Headbutt is physical STAB.
    Fire Punch hits Bronzong/Jirachi more than HP Fire but isn't as good against Scizor/Ferrothorn/Skarmory.
    Ice Punch is a physical alternative to Ice Beam.



Checks & Counters
########

    Deoxys-A doesn't have any counters as it can kill pretty much everything with the appropriate move.
    Psychic Arceus is the closest thing to a true counter since it only fears Dark Pulse.
    Multiscale Lugia can take any one hit at full HP and kill Deoxys-A with Aeroblast.
    Yveltal is immune to Psycho Boost and has Sucker Punch but is weak to Ice Beam and Sucker Punch can be trolled by Extreme Speed.
    Jirachi and Bronzong work well against sets without Knock Off or Dark Pulse.
    Ghost-types with priority are good revenge killers since they are immune to Extreme Speed - Giratina-O, Aegislash, Arceus-Ghost.
    Other priority users such as Rayquaza, Arceus, and Mega Kangaskhan can revenge easily.
    Scizor can force Deoxys-A into a checkmate position with Bullet Punch and Pursuit, but needs to watch out for HP Fire and still takes a lot of damage from Psycho Boost if it attempts to switch in directly.
    Faster Scarfers like Xerneas, Genesect, Palkia, Terrakion, etc. can revenge kill Deoxys-A easily.
