[Overview]

<p>Wigglytuff is a depressing case of a Pokemon. Since its inception nearly 15 years ago, its mediocre stats and the mere existence of Clefable, Chansey, and even Lickitung had doomed Wigglytuff into complete obscurity. While Wigglytuff remains generally outclassed in BW NU, it does have some perks over its main competitors, Lickilicky and Alomomola. Wigglytuff's amazing support movepool gives it access to several moves the more popular Wish passers lack, such as dual screens and Stealth Rock. While Wigglytuff often won't be one's first choice for a NU supporter, it truly is a decent Pokemon in its own right, despite the harsh competition it faces for a teamslot.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Wigglytuff's main niche over its competitors is its ability to pass titantic Wishes, while simultaneously providing dual screen support. Although Wigglytuff is slow, it still finds opportunities to set up screens in the face of defensive Pokemon that can not touch it, such as Miltank and Regirock. Wigglytuff can then use its decent bulk to pass a Wish to an incoming set-up sweeper, such as Shell Smash Gorebyss or Dragon Dance Altaria, almost guaranteeing a set-up opportunity if the opponent does not hit the switch-in with a status move. Seismic Toss is used in the last slot to prevent Wigglytuff from becoming setup bait for users of Substitute or Taunt, although Heal Bell is also useful to remove an unfortunate status effect that may afflict one of your sweepers.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Since Wigglytuff's HP is already so high, the EVs are split into both defensive stats to help it tank weak hits before setting up the respective screen. A Calm nature is used to buffer Wigglytuff's Special Defense, as its typing is better suited to walling special attacks. Wigglytuff's HP can be maximized to make its Wishes 30 HP larger, but the slight increase generally isn't worth it. Protect is another option for the fourth slot to complete the classic Wish + Protect combo, but it's also not recommended because this set lacks leftovers and is strapped for moveslots as it is. Furthermore, Protect also has a nasty side effect of stalling out your own screens. Obvious partners for this Wigglytuff are set-up sweepers that enjoy dual screen support. Dragon Dance Altaria is a great candidate because of its great natural bulk and its resistance to Fighting-type attacks, Wigglytuff's only weakness.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Wigglytuff can also run a decent Wish set, despite being mostly outclassed by Lickilicky and Alomomola. Wish and Protect are staples of the set, and neither of them should ever be removed. While Chansey and Clefable occasionally forgo the use of Protect in higher tiers on their respective Wish sets, Wigglytuff's bulk simply isn't reliable enough to keep it alive while it waits for its Wish to heal itself. In addition, Protect is useful for scouting what move the common Choice users in NU are using. Seismic Toss is present to help Wigglytuff dish out consistent damage while also preventing it from becoming complete Taunt bait. Stealth Rock is the primary option for the final slot, as it is one of the few perks Wigglytuff has over its Wish passing brethren. Heal Bell and Thunder Wave are generic support options, but they are generally better suited on other support Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A specially defensive spread is utilized here so that Wigglytuff's HP can be maxed out; the ability to pass slightly larger Wishes is one of the few factors that keeps this set from being completely outclassed by Lickilicky. Wigglytuff's decent attacking stats can be utilized to run an actual attack over Seismic Toss; however, they generally don't do enough damage to be worthwhile, unless the opponent is 4x weak to it. That being said, Wigglytuff does have a large movepool to choose from: Ice Beam, Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, Shadow Ball, and even Focus Blast can be utilized to capture some Pokemon completely off guard. Ice Beam is especially commendable for being able to OHKO Dragon Dance Altaria after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>Wigglytuff, as with all support Pokemon, despises entry hazards. Stealth Rock and Spikes chip away at its health, and Toxic Spikes stop all Wigglytuff sets cold that aren't running Heal Bell. Moreover, Wigglytuff appreciates hazards on the opponent's side of the field as well, especially Toxic Spikes, so that it can do some Toxic stalling through a combination of Wish and Protect. Garbodor is a great partner, as it absorbs opposing Toxic Spikes while laying down both Spikes and Toxic Spikes of its own. Garbodor's acceptable bulk and Fighting-type resistance also make it a prime candidate as a partner for Wigglytuff.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Wigglytuff has an amazing movepool, as expected of a Normal-type. Wigglytuff's stats make it a decent candidate for a Counter set, and with a Chople Berry, Wigglytuff can catch opposing Sawk off guard with a swift OHKO if their Sturdy isn't active. Wigglytuff can also run all sorts of gimmicky attacking sets, utilizing Charge Beam and its wide special movepool or through use of a Choice Band and Wigglytuff's access to Double-Edge and all of the elemental punches. However, Wigglytuff is weak and slow, making these sets inferior except for surprise value. Wigglytuff also makes a great setter of Gravity, utilizing its good bulk and access to a normally inaccurate sleeping move in Sing.</p>

<p>Wigglytuff receives the dubious Frisk ability from the Dream World, which allows it to see what item an opponent is carrying when Wigglytuff switches into battle. It might sound nifty, but in reality, Frisk isn't that useful, mainly because it only activates when Wigglytuff switches in; Wigglytuff generally wants to know the items of Pokemon that are forcing it out, such as whether or not the Sawk staring it down is equipped with a Choice Scarf or Choice Band. To make matters worse, Frisk is illegal with many of Wigglytuff's most useful moves, such as Seismic Toss and Stealth Rock. For these reasons, it is best to stick with Cute Charm.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any and all Fighting-types immediately threaten Wigglytuff, especially Sawk. Ghost-types are also a problem for Wigglytuff, as they completely immune to Seismic Toss; Substitute + Calm Mind Misdreavus and Drifblim can even set up on a completely helpless Wigglytuff. In addition, although Wigglytuff's bulk is acceptable, it will still fall to exceptionally powerful attacks, such as Facade from Swellow or Ursaring. Wigglytuff's usefulness is also completely undercut by Toxic or Toxic Spikes.</p>
