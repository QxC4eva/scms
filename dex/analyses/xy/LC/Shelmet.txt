Moves
========

- Spikes is a very effective entry hazard to use on Shelmet because of its ability to force switches and get extra turns since it can't do much with those turns otherwise. 
- Bug Buzz hits Pokemon like Carvanha relatively hard and is a main STAB attack.
- Toxic is Shelmet's main form of damage since its Bug Buzz is fairly weak. 
- Recover is they key to Shelmet's amazing bulk and longevity. It can use this move along with Toxic to stall many Pokemon out. 

Set Details
========

- EVs maximize bulk. 
- Overcoat is used to absorb Spore, Sleep Powder, and Stun Spore. 

Usage Tips
========
- Shelmet is best used as a counter to Pokemon such as Carvanha and Fighting-types.
- It is better to kill something with Toxic + Recover than Bug Buzz because it will end with more HP at the end. 
- Switch into Pokemon it counters, lay Spikes. 

Team Options
========

- Fletchling is dangerous. It's important to have bulky Pokemon such as Chinchou to soak its hits. 
- Shelmet needs partners that can switch into Fire-type moves. Water-types such as Tirtouga, Staryu and Chinchou are good in this regard.
- Pokemon with U-turn and Volt Switch are great at spreading hazard damage. Stall teams also benefit from hazard damage. 


Other Options
########

- Can run an effective Acid Armor + Baton Pass set. 
- Acid Armor could also be used on the usual set to stop Shed Skin Scraggy from taking it on.
- It gets Shell Armor which can be useful to critical hits, especially in a Baton Pass chain
- Yawn can be an effective move over Toxic to force switches. 
- Encore can help versus Pokemon who would otherwise set up on Shelmet. 

Checks & Counters
########

- **Flying-types:** Fletchling and Vullaby hurt it with SE STAB moves.
- **Fire-types:** Take nothing from Bug Buzz and can generally 2HKO back.
- **Poison-types:** Take nothing from Bug Buzz and Toxic.
- **Stealth Rock:** Makes it harder to switch into Pokemon such as Carvanha.
