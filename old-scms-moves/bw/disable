[SHORT DESC]
Prevents the last move used from being used again for 4 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For 4 turns, one adjacent target's last move used becomes disabled. Fails if one of the target's moves is already disabled, if the target has not moved, or if the target no longer knows the move. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Ignores a target's Substitute.</p> 

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Disable is a very interesting move that few Pokemon can use well. It will disable the last move that successfully hit, which can be useful to stop many threats in their tracks, who rely on a single move to deal with certain threats. It also got a good boost in this generation, where its accuracy was raised to 100%, making it much more reliable. Since the introduction of Choice items, a lot of Pokemon are stuck with one move as soon as they enter in the field, and if Disable hits said Pokemon, they will have no other alternative than to Struggle in that turn and switch out on the next, giving the user a free turn.</p>

<p>The most notable user is definitely Gengar, thanks to some distinct factors: its high Speed, good offensive movepool, and very useful immunities against common types, as well as difficulty to hit effectively without a Pokemon's main moves, make him shine as a prominent user. Typically, Substitute is used alongside Disable in order to avoid having to take strong attacks head-on.</p>
