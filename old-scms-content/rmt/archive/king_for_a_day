<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Best RMT name ever y/y? So this has been my go to NU team as of the past two months but following the release of Gothitelle it effectiveness has dropped so I’ve decided to go ahead and retire this version of the team. I’m still open to suggestions though!</p>

<p>Now this team really doesn’t have any history behind it or any #1 ladder peaks but its served me very well in mini tours/test matches and maintains a pretty good record on PS. It started out with me really wanting to use the Beast known only as ZANGOOSE. I really wanted this team to just wear the opposing team down so much that Zangoose could come in at the end and clean up. A cool thing about this team is that even though its meant for Zangoose to sweep, every member of the team has the capability to get 1-2 KO’s each and even perform a sweep if the conditions are right. </p>

<p>So in my search for the perfect teammates, I stumbled upon LO Kangaskhan. Not only does Kangaskhan put huge dents into Golurk and Misdreavus(which helps Zangoose tremendously as I can then spam Facade to my heart’s content) it also is an incredible revenge killer. Fake Out+Sucker Punch is a dead stop to most of NU’s frailer sweepers such as Gorebyss, Cinccino, and most weather sweepers. At this point I really wanted a check to Cinccino, Swellow, and company and CBB showed me my favorite SR setter in NU, Rocky Helmet Regirock. The extra 16% on Choice Scarf Braviary or Cinccino is so amazing and really lets this team work its magic. These last 3 Pokemon were chosen because I thought they would have good synergy and help patch up some weaknesses and they did the job admirably. Gurdurr helped give my team more priority and was a strong check to Absol which I need and utilized a pretty underrated set in 4 Atks. Up next was Amoonguss who gave me a good check to most fighting types and also beat the Regenerator core and also gave my opponents quite a surprise  . And last but not least, CM Musharna who is a staple on most of my teams just because it’s a full stop to every fighting type out there and is also capable of sweeping at any moment. At this point the team was finished!</p>

<p>This team is very offensive and works by knowing when to sacrifice certain Pokemon in order to get vital damage on the opposing team thus opening up a sweep for any of my other Pokemon. It requires a fair bit of prediction to pull off and probably isn’t the easiest team to use but man it was fun to use!</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/377.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Regirock</strong> @ Rocky Helmet<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Rock Slide</p>

<p>Rocky Helmet Regirock is just amazing in the metagame right now. Not only is it still very bulky but its also pretty strong. Being able to wall Swellow, Braviary, and Cinccino while also taking HP from Samurott and Zangoose is just invaluable to me. </p>

<p>Stealth Rock is for the obvious hazards and limits the lifespans on the Birds and passive damage is always good. Ice Punch is now over Thunder Wave since it lets Regirock hit Golurk and Torterra which my team really needed. Drain Punch is the only form of recovery that Regirock has and it hits decently hard. It’s cool for hitting Cinccino and Zangoose for some strong damage. Rock Slide is for obligatory STAB and smacks Rotom-S around.</p>

<p>The EVs are pretty standard. Nearly max HP for bulk, max Attack and Adamant for as much power as possible, and the remainder in Speed.</p>

<p><strong>Musharna</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Synchronize<br />
EVs: 240 HP / 252 Def / 16 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Moonlight<br />
- Heal Bell</p>

<p>Ah Calm Mind Musharna you are so reliable. Musharna is really here mainly because it stops all fighting types in their tracks and I wanted another bulkier mon to help sponge strong hits if need be. The best thing about Musharna though is that it is always possible for it to sweep as well. Musharna’s moveset isn’t one of a support mon but that’s really what it is. Its my first switch in to Gurdurr and Sawk and usually manages to take out 1 or 2 Pokemon a game which is enough for me. It also manages to beat the Regen core one on one as long as it has a boost or two for Amoonguss.</p>

<p>Calm Mind is there to give Musharna an option to sweep while Psychic is its only attacking move and also its only STAB move. Moonlight is such a great move since I can sit there and tank Sawk and Gurdurr all day while boosting in their face. And Heal Bell rounds out the moveset and its really useful when playing against Pokemon that use Toxic as Synchronize will Poison them while I can cure the Poison and continue boosting.</p>

<p>The EVs are standard for Musharna to achieve max bulk with a little speed creep on my part.</p>

<p><strong>Amoonguss</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 136 Def / 112 SpA / 12 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Spore<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Sludge Bomb<br />
- Hidden Power Ground</p>

<p>This is where the sets starting getting a little stranger. LO Amoonguss is the only Amoonguss set I use now. Its just so good. I have to thank Django for thrashing me with this set and then giving it to me as it really is a strong set. Now you may think, “Why the fuck are you using LO Amoonguss?” To which I respond, “Why are you not?” Honestly the onsite Amoonguss set while walling many threats, was just not strong enough for me and was set up fodder for too many threats so when Django showed me this set I was in love. Funnily enough this set still checks a majority of the things the bulkier set does while still causing a surprising amount of damage.</p>

<p>Spore is honestly a pretty broken move as it basically incapacitates one Pokemon on the opposing team, which for me is great as I can continue pounding the opponent into submission. Giga Drain is STAB and a very good way to offset the LO Recoil. Its also helpful in breaking down any bulky waters and Rock Types that may give my team some trouble. Sludge Bomb is also STAB and it hits surprisingly hard. Doing about 75% to Swellow on the switch is just awesome and the poison chance is just an added bonus against things like Gardevoir and Gothitelle. Hidden Power Ground is probably the biggest oddball but it allows Amoonguss to beat other poison types such as Garbodor, Arbok, and especially Skuntank. It makes this set an even better lure. It also messes up Probopass and Bastiodon as well.</p>

<p>So I’m assuming these EVs are to maximize bulk while also boosting Amoonguss’ Special Attack to give it more power (since I did not make the set) and then adding the rest into Speed. Yeah that sounds smart let’s go with that</p>

<p><strong>Gurdurr</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Guts<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Mach Punch<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Payback</p>

<p>Here’s another underrated set that really should see more use, 4 Attacks Gurdurr(credit to Zebraiken <3). Zebbles had been talking about this set for a while and I decided to give it a go as Knock Off would let me take away Eviolite from Misdreavus and take away Leftovers from walls. This gives Zangoose and Kangaskhan an easier time in breaking down the opposing team. It also hits really hard even without the boosts from Bulk Up(just ask CBB) and is still a great Absol check while also being really bulky.</p>

<p>Drain Punch is once again STAB and is a good move to spam when all fight resists are gone and does big damage to Regirock and Golem which is good for Zangoose as he can then clean much easier. Mach Punch is for priority and is cool to get in a last minute hit on a sweeper so Kangaskhan or Zangoose can come in and finish it off. Ice Punch is my best way to hit Golurk on this team besides Kanga and also hits Eggy pretty hard which is very cool. Knock Off is just a cool move in general especially since this team thrives on getting walls broken down as quickly as possible and that’s much easier when they don’t have leftovers recovery.</p>

<p>The EVs and nature are pretty standard fare for Gurdurr. Not much to say here.</p>

<p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Scrappy<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Fake Out<br />
- Double-Edge<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Sucker Punch</p>

<p>Whatever happened to Kangaskhan usage? It’s still an incredible Pokemon and really should be used more. Anywho this is Zangoose’s partner in crime hitting Ghosts like Golurk and Misdreavus because of Scrappy. Fake Out+Double Edge does about 90% to Golurk which makes it easy for Zangoose to kill it with Night Slash and proceed to spam Facade. That’s not all that Kangaskhan is good for though! Kanga is also a very good revenge killer with Fake Out and Sucker Punch knocking out a good portion of NU Sweepers. Kanga is also decently bulky so it can take a hit or two even though it usually doesn’t need to.</p>

<p>I feel like I’ve pretty well explained why Fake Out and Sucker Punch are used so I won’t say anymore on that. Double Edge is a really strong move to spam since even ghosts can’t come in on it safely. It does a large chunk to nearly everything really helps weaken opposing teams. Drain Punch is kind of filler to be honest but sometimes it’s nice to hit things like Regirock on the switch and gain some HP. Mostly though I’ll be spamming Fake Out and Double Edge.</p>

<p>Max Attack for the most power possible and Max Speed + Jolly nature to max Kanga’s speed as it’s a pretty fast Pokemon.</p>

<p><strong>Zangoose</strong> @ Toxic Orb<br />
Ability: Toxic Boost<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Facade<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Night Slash<br />
- Quick Attack</p>

<p>THE BOSS. Bow down to Zangoose as its most likely swept you at some point. </p>

<p>This guy right here is the biggest reason why I win most of my games. If I’ve done my job right all his checks are either weakened or eliminated and Zangoose can end the game for me. Once Toxic Orb activates and Toxic Boost kicks in Zangoose turns into an absolute monster. Reaching an incredible attack stat of 493 after Toxic Boost, Zangoose really is the biggest threat in the meta imo.</p>

<p>Facade is Zangoose’s most powerful move after Toxic Boost kicks in and nukes just about everything. Facade Ohko’s almost everything in NU that doesn’t resist it or is immune to it. Close Combat is Zangoose’s best way of getting past Regirock, Bastiodon, and company while Night Slash is cool for picking off weakened Golurk and Misdreavus. Quick Attack is a great move to use on this Zangoose since it can come in on weakened Scarf Braviary’s and other weakened mons and kill it with Quick Attack thus activating Toxic Orb and Toxic Boost all in one go. Then it’s a nice way to avoid Absol and Skuntank’s Sucker Punch and hitting them for good damage.</p>

<p>Standard sweeper spread for Zangoose and I really should not have to explain this lol.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Even though this is a pre-Gothitelle team, I still have had a good amount of success with it even in this meta as well as in the previous one. I hope it was an enjoyable read and feel free to rate/hate/steal/LUVDISC and whatever else you want to do! Thanks for reading ladies and gents!</p>
