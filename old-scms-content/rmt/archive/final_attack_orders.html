<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/485.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Uxie</strong> @ Light Clay<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Memento<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Light Screen<br />
- Reflect</p>

<p>The Pokemon that gets the whole party started. Sets up Dual Screens which are vital to my team, and also gives me some nice Stealth Rocks. Memento is used for when I know that I don't need Uxie anymore / have a great set up opportunity I need to take advantage of. EVs maximize its bulk and Speed so that it can take hits and set up screens no matter what. Uxie's support makes it EXTREMELY easy for me to set up, especially if I get to Memento the opponent as well. Its 95 Base Speed also means that it can outrun a large part of the metagame, which is very helpful against Pokemon such as Sharpedo and Moltres.</p>

<p><strong>Linoone</strong> @ Sitrus Berry<br />
Ability: Gluttony<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Belly Drum<br />
- Shadow Claw<br />
- Rock Smash<br />
- Extremespeed</p>

<p>THE STAR OF THE SHOW. This thing sweeps entire teams so easily it's not even funny. Belly Drum brings this guy's attack to a ridiculous 948 in 1 turn, allowing it to wreak havoc like no tomorrow. Max Speed Jolly gives Linoone the ability to outrun everything it needs to. For example, Rotom is easily outsped and destroyed by Shadow Claw. Its Speed also means that it can destroy Entei with ExtremeSpeed, or at least speed tie with it if for some reason the opponent is running an extremely rare Jolly Entei. Speaking of ExtremeSpeed, it's +2 priority means that Linoone can easily devastate a large part of the metagame. As I mentioned earlier, Shadow Claw is vital for destroying Ghost-types, especially the likes of Cofagrigus and Haunter. Rock Smash rounds out the set by giving Linoone a way to completely troll Steel-types, especially Aggron (cough, Texas, cough). Screens are usually in play after this guy sets up, and thanks to Sitrus Berry, Linoone's HP will usually be high enough to take weak hits. TLDR: Decimates teams all day long.</p>

<p><strong>Omastar</strong> @ White Herb<br />
Ability: Swift Swim<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Hidden Power Grass<br />
- Shell Smash<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Ice Beam</p>

<p>A Pokemon that can turn the tide of a game around in a flash. This thing hits so hard it's not even funny, and its solid Defense behind dual screens support and solid typing means that setting up is as easy as pie. Shell Smash is just amazing, boosting Omastar's Speed to an excellent 458 and its Special Attack above 600 in one fell swoop. A Timid nature allows it to hit that speed mark and outrun Rotom-C, who manages to switch into Omastar every time it uses Shell Smash. Hidden Power Grass annihilates Quagsire and deals a good chunk of damage to Lanturn and Slowking after a boost. Ice Beam provides solid coverage and Hydro Pump rounds out the set by providing Omastar with a move that can easily OHKO a large part of the metagame after a Shell Smash. Finally, White Herb guarantees that Omastar's defenses aren't hurt by Shell Smash, allowing it to Sucker Punches from Honchkrow and the like like no other. </p>

<p><strong>klinklang</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Plus<br />
EVs: 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Shift Gear<br />
- Gear Grind<br />
- Return<br />
- Substitute</p>

<p>More people should use Klinklang since it is an absolute beast. It can easily set up behind dual screens with Dragon Dance 2.0 and destroy. Substitute guarantees that Pokemon such as Ferroseed won't be able to Leech Seed it, and makes dual screen support even more deadly. Speaking of Ferroseed, a major benefit of Klinklang is that it can set up on the pathetic creature like no tomorrow, easily gaining +6. Gear Grind acts as Klinklang's STAB move, and hits twice, meaning that it can destroy Pokemon cowering in fear behind Rhydon dolls. Return grants it good neutral coverage, allowing it to hit Water-types such as Feraligatr for good damage.</p>

<p><strong>Drapion</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sniper<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Ice Fang<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>Probably the most underrated sweeper in RU. This thing is very unexpected, and can wreak havoc very easily. Drapion's solid defenses mean that it can take hits well, allowing it to easily set up a Swords Dance. It also absorbs Toxic Spikes for other members of my team. Crunch is a solid STAB move, and in tandem with Earthquake, provides perfect neutral coverage in RU. Ice Fang nails Gligar, which usually thinks it can have a field day with Drapion. 95 Base Speed is very solid in RU, and thanks to its bulk and dual screens, and can usually live hits anyway. I originally ran Life Orb on this, but switched to Leftovers since it greatly increases its survivability, which is important for this team.</p>

<p><strong>Cofagrigus</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Mummy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA<br />
Quiet Nature<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting<br />
- Trick Room<br />
- Nasty Plot</p>

<p>The best spin-blocker in RU. This thing is an absolute beast, and can tear teams apart in a mere 4 turns. With 3 pokes weak to Fighting, Cofagrigus is my go-to Pokemon for all of the Hitmonchans and Gallades out there. It takes their pathetic Ice Punches and Shadow Sneaks as well as Shuckle takes a Tackle from a Level 1 Happiny. It then proceeds to Nasty Plot, Trick Room, and decimate the opposition. Cofagrigus's extremely low Speed means that it can outrun almost every Pokemon in RU in Trick Room, allowing it to become even more of a threat. This thing can single-handedly 6-0 opposing offensive teams, no questions asked. Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting provide perfect neutral coverage in RU, making this thing even more deadly. </p>
