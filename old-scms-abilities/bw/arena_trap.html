[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Opposing grounded Pokemon cannot switch out while the wielder is on the field. Grounded Pokemon are those that are not part Flying-type, do not have the ability <a href="/bw/abilities/levitate">Levitate</a>, do not have <a href="/bw/moves/magnet_rise">Magnet Rise</a> active, and are not holding an <a href="/bw/items/air_balloon">Air Balloon</a>. If <a href="/bw/moves/gravity">Gravity</a> is active, all Pokemon are grounded. All Pokemon holding an <a href="/bw/items/iron_ball">Iron Ball</a> are grounded, as are Pokemon under the effect of <a href="/bw/moves/ingrain">Ingrain</a> (although they can't manually switch out anyway). A grounded Pokemon can escape by using <a href="/bw/moves/baton_pass">Baton Pass</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/u-turn">U-turn</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/volt_switch">Volt Switch</a> (as long as the wielder isn't immune to Volt Switch), or by holding the item <a href="/bw/items/shed_shell">Shed Shell</a>. Arena Trap does not prevent the effect of <a href="/bw/items/eject_button">Eject Button</a>.</p>

<p>When the wielder is first in the party, the chance of wild encounters occurring is increased.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This ability is incredibly useful. Its very low distribution has only increased its niche. Three Pokemon have access to Arena Trap. <a href="/bw/pokemon/diglett">Diglett</a> is used in LC, whilst its evolution, <a href="/bw/pokemon/dugtrio">Dugtrio</a>, can often be seen in the upper tiers. Sometimes, Dugtrio even makes an appearance in Ubers due to its ability to trap Pokemon locked into <a href="/bw/moves/thunder">Thunder</a> or another Electric-type attack, and then dispatch them swiftly with a STAB <a href="/bw/moves/earthquake">Earthquake</a>. This makes Dugtrio the perfect revenge killer, more or less guaranteeing the removal of a problem Pokemon, but Dugtrio does have a tendency to become set-up fodder afterwards.</p>
