    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I'm not going to tell you how boring the Uber metagame is now, thanks to a certain newcomer. It's pretty easy to use a rain team, and you have to take a lot of risks when playing offense if you want to be original and not be swept by Arceus / walled by Ferrothorn.</p>
    <p>So, 6 month ago, my fellow Uber brother, Private, and I decided to build a team that wouldn't use any standard core currently used. We took a look at the current metagame and Kabutops was something that often came in our minds since he could walk through Drown All, shit on random offense, and make his way through Drought teams. This team peaked at #1 a lot of times, but hey, the Smogon and PO ladders aren't what we would call a challenge.</p>
    <p>We did something we can be proud of for sure, since this team was our most successful in BW Uber despite being restricted by a lot of things. Anyway, here is the team !</p>

    <!-- begin team building process -->
    <h2>Team Building Process</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/382.png" title="Kyogre" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" title="Kabutops" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>Started with Ogre + Kabu obviously since we wanted to make a rain team around the fossil.</p>
    
    <p>
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/387.png" title="Deoxys-a" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/212.png" title="Scizor" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/150.png" title="Mewtwo" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/382.png" title="Kyogre" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" title="Kabutops" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/508.png" title="Arceus" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>We were watching Dr. House and didn't have any ideas, so we used the house trump card : throw everything you have on the board and test it ! Mewtwo for wallbreaking here and there, Deo-A to setup SR and hit the whole metagame hard, Scizor for a cool Uturn and a needed dragon resist that can also "revenge kill" with BP, and DragoCeus in the last spot for a second Water resist and our second main sweeper. After some tests, Ferrothorn walled the whole team, recovering more on Leech Seed than what he lost on U-turn ... Kyogre was also a pain in the ass.</p>
    
    <p>
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/488.png" title="Dialga" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/212.png" title="Scizor" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/150.png" title="Mewtwo" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/382.png" title="Kyogre" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" title="Kabutops" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/508.png" title="Arceus" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>Ok so we kept the formula we used previously, removed Deo-A for Dialga LO SR, since it brought another water resist and could setup SR and hit Ferrothorn fairly hard with Fire Blast. However, Dialga doesn't hit hard when not super-effective (hi Arceus / Chansey / Lugia). It was a little better but still not good. And that's where we made the worst choice ever for an offense user ...</p>
    
    <p>
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/450.png" title="Garchomp" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/212.png" title="Scizor" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/150.png" title="Mewtwo" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/382.png" title="Kyogre" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" title="Kabutops" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/514.png" title="Arceus" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>Removed Dialga for BandChomp for an elec' immunity and very good dual STAB and put GrassCeus over DragoCeus. Ferrothorn wasn't able anymore to spam Leech Seed (free Spikes now though), but God ... it was really bad at best. GrassCeus is the worst Arceus ever for an offense user. He doesn't hit hard, he let a free setup for everything ... anyway, he wasn't what we needed. We also tried SD Chomp, but wow, Arceus eats Chomp alive ...</p>
    
    <p>
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/674.png" title="Zekrom" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/212.png" title="Scizor" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/150.png" title="Mewtwo" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/382.png" title="Kyogre" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" title="Kabutops" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/514.png" title="Arceus" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>Tried MixKrom over Chomp, we can lure Groudon and Ferrothorn easily and kill them with Focus Blast / Draco Meteor. But the team was a bit too much EH weak.</p>
    
    <p>
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/489.png" title="Palkia" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/442.png" title="Bronzong" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/150.png" title="Mewtwo" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/382.png" title="Kyogre" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" title="Kabutops" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/515.png" title="Arceus" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>Bronzong on Garchomp for a Groudon check and also to lure Ferrothorn and "kill" him with Hypnosis. He helped vs MindCeus too. Hi Pokemon Online; I never hit with this shit. We also used GroundCeus + Palkia: not bad, but still not what we want.</p>
    
    <p>
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/489.png" title="Palkia" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/442.png" title="Bronzong" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/248.png" title="Tyranitar" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/382.png" title="Kyogre" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" title="Kabutops" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/513.png" title="Arceus" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>Fuck off Mewtwo, here is TyraniBoss; we tried to make a team without him, but meh, he's too great. Changed GroundCeus for something more manly, with more swag--Ghostceus SD. The team worked really well, but we had nothing for checking Thunder. Since Hypnosis never worked, we decided to get rid of Bronzong.</p>
    
    <p>
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/489.png" title="Palkia" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/558.png" title="Excadrill" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/248.png" title="Tyranitar" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/382.png" title="Kyogre" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/141.png" title="Kabutops" alt="" /> &nbsp; 
        <img src="/download/sprites/bw/498.png" title="Arceus" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>The team was almost perfect, the only thing that was a problem is (again) Ferrothorn and some other mons. We needed something that hit like a truck. Since MixKia wasnt good enough, we changed it for the Specs set and changed Ghostceus for EKceus. Here, it's perfect ! We got what we wanted.</p>

    <p><strong>Rider</strong> @ Focus Sash</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sand Stream</li>
      <li>200 Atk / 56 SAtk / 252 Spd</li>
      <li>Lonely Nature (+Atk, -Def)</li>
      <li>Moveset:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fire Blast</strong> - A gift for Groudon, Ferrothorn and Foretress. Groudon is 3HKOed and we're faster, a good thing for the weather war. The two other are 2HKOed.</li>
          <li><strong>Crunch</strong> - Main weapon. Strong enough to not let anything come as they want, perfect coverage with Low Kick and STABed. I used to play Payback back in the DPP days but with its nerf, Crunch became more effective.</li>
          <li><strong>Stealth Rock</strong> - Something we need to hurt Lugia, Ho-Oh and Rayquaza, three things the team doesn't really love. Every team need SR anyway.</li>
          <li><strong>Low Kick</strong> - Perfect coverage with Crunch, 2HKOes any Dialga and Ferrothorn, and does so-so against Fightceus if he try to setup on us.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Why this Pok√©mon?</strong>
        <ul class="no-style">
          <li>Back in the business ! No true lead anymore with the team preview ? Tyranitar isn't suited for this spot ? Screw the rules ! We made and used this Tyranitar since DP, and God he's still a serious threat to take in account. Truly good at what he needs to do : lure, weaken the team and setup SR. He allows us to lead off well by firing off his STAB and lure out easily Skarmory and Kyogre (always thinking he can brainlessly spam Water Spout since we doesnt have a true Ogre counter). There is no doubt about the fact that Tyranitar was, and still is, THE anti-metagame Pokemon at the moment.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Speed, item and nature:</strong>
        <ul class="no-style">
          <li>Enough speed to outrun Groudon, Dialga and any defensive 90 bs. Enough SpA to 3HKO Groudon; the rest goes in attack for obvious reason. Focus Sash to let him take a hit he can't survive.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lead matchup:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><span style="color: #009933;">Deo-S</span></strong> : Crunch it if he try to setup SR or setup it if he switch. Crunch does enough to 2HKO it even if he use Reflect.</li>
          <li><strong><span style="color: #ff0033;">Darkrai</span></strong> : Meh, no SR for us. We'll let Tar take the Dark Void then switch on Kyogre. He's annoying since he can force us to lock our Ogre on Water Spout and lose the momentum. Use SR anyway in case he misses.</li>
          <li><strong><span style="color: #009933;">Kyogre</span></strong> : See if its raining or not; we'll know if he's an offensive or defensive variant. Most of the time, we'll just SR since we dont really fear him.</li>
          <li><strong><span style="color: #ff6633;">Deo-A</span></strong> : Crunch. He can be annoying because he breaks our Sash and we'll always play without SR. No SR for him too though and we keep the momentum.</li>
          <li><strong><span style="color: #009933;">Dialga</span></strong> : Low Kick then SR. Use it in this order because Low Kick does enough damage to force him to switch out (most of the time for Skarmory or Arceus).</li>
          <li><strong><span style="color: #009933;">Groudon</span></strong> : The sun should shine. Fire Blast, Fire Blast, then SR. If he used EQ in the first turn, use SR instead of FB the 2nd time.</li>
          <li><strong><span style="color: #009933;">Forretress</span></strong> : Crunch/Low Kick to break Sturdy and let him think we cant do shit to him then Fire Blast.</li>
          <li><strong><span style="color: #ff6633;">Arceus</span></strong> : If its a type we are not weak to, then SR; if it is, then Crunch / Low Kick.</li>
          <li><strong><span style="color: #009933;">Tentacruel</span></strong> : Since we're leading with Kyogre on the team preview, they can sometimes try to lead with him (Protect for choice blablabla). Crunch the fuck out of him for a clean 2HKO then Fire Blast the obvious Ferrothorn incoming.</li>
          <li><strong><span style="color: #009933;">Thundurus</span></strong> : Fairly uncommon but pretty good anti-lead. Crunch or SR, it depends if you think he'll Taunt or not.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Caster</strong> @ Choice Scarf</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drizzle</li>
      <li>4 HP / 252 SAtk / 252 Spd</li>
      <li>Timid Nature (+Spd, -Atk)</li>
      <li>Moveset:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Water Spout</strong> - A powerful STAB we use early game to weaken Ferrothorn and Palkia so they can't wall Kabutops anymore.</li>
          <li><strong>Surf</strong> - Strong, STABed and perfect precision.</li>
          <li><strong>Ice Beam</strong> - Good when used with Surf&amp;Thunder if you know what I mean.</li>
          <li><strong>Thunder</strong> - Boltbeam blablabla.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Why this Pok√©mon?</strong>
        <ul class="no-style">
          <li>First of all, we needed the rain since we wanted to build a team around Kabutops. We used the Specs in the beginning for a clean 2hko on Ferrothorn, which is always good to get rid off under rain. However, the lack of speed was annoying and after some tests, it appears to us that the Scarf was the most useful for its revenge kill abilities. Kyogre is extremely important for the rain; his type allowing some pivoting, and his power and speed are simply fabulous~.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Speed, item and nature:</strong>
        <ul class="no-style">
          <li>Timid to outrun Deo-A and avoid the tie with the overly common Modest ScarfOgre.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How does it work?</strong>
        <ul class="no-style">
          <li>It depends on what we are facing. If we're playing against a sun team, we'll try to keep Ogre in good health so we can come on the field and summon the rain while taking Groudon's EQ should the need arise. He baits the opponent's water resist and opens a path for Kabutops. Against rain offense, Ogre is going to bait Thunder from Palkia or any Thunder user for Excadrill, and we really don't care about losing Kyogre. Of course, if we can sweep with him, we'll not waste it, and we'll be careful and keep him on the side since we don't need him to summon the rain. On the other hand, if we're facing rain stall, Kyogre's only purpose is going to be spamming Water Spout on Dialga / Ferrothorn and baiting the special wall (aka Giratina/Chansey) for a free Excadrill setup.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- begin third set -->
    <p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/489.png" title="Palkia" alt="" /></p>
    <p><strong>Berseker</strong> @ Choice Specs</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pressure</li>
      <li>4 HP / 252 SAtk / 252 Spd</li>
      <li>Timid Nature (+Spd, -Atk)</li>
      <li>Moveset:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spacial Rend</strong> - A powerful STAB that can 2HKO the whole metagame beside Chansey/Blissey and the Steel type. Groudon and Dialga can be OHKOed with previous damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Hydro Pump</strong> - The "I dont give a shit" button when under rain.</li>
          <li><strong>Fire Blast</strong> - Can OHKO Ferrothorn even under rain, what a beautiful thing to see ... Used for the other steel type too but Hydro Pump is enough for them usually. 3HKO Ho-Oh too without SR ... nuff said.</li>
          <li><strong>Thunder</strong> - OHKOes Kyogre, Lugia and is powerful enough to hurt anyone trying to setup.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Why this Pok√©mon?</strong>
        <ul class="no-style">
          <li>He was the last mon to be picked. We had absolutely nothing for Kyogre and we needed a check, so Palkia came in and saved our ass. But we needed also a strong wallbreaker, so we obviously tested MixKia. After some testing, he wasnt as good as we thought. Ferrothorn was a pain in the ass under rain since he was able to take Fire Blast and use leech seed. Arceus was in the same boat, coming on Palkia and setting up Calm Mind like if it was nothing. We tested every Kia: Expert belt was weak as fuck, Lustrous Orb wasnt powerful enough against Ferrothorn, and Life Orb drained Kia's health too much (no surprise factor anymore too). So we thought about the specs. We didnt believe it was worth the try at the beginning but we gave him a shot and god, that was the best decision we could make. Even though we had to switch when locked on a resist, SpecsKia was THE pokemon we needed. We didn't even have to use Fire Blast for getting rid off Ferrothorn under rain which is just awesome. Some of you might think "why not SpecsOgre and ScarfKia ? You still 2HKO Ferrothorn and revenge kill Rayquaza !" Fool ! The main advantage over Kyogre is his Dragon type. Palkia will NEVER come on Palkia, fearing Spacial Rend, so we can easily fire off Hydro Pump and catch Ferrothorn. In conclusion, SpecsKia can do the same job as MixKia, if not better, by luring and killing Ferrothorn, AND still having a fucking retarded Hydropump that 2HKOes almost everyone.</li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>How does it work?</strong>
        <ul class="no-style">
          <li>Come on the field when he can/you need to take Water Spout, then see what the opponent has. If it's raining and Chansey is below 82%, use Hydropump; we dont care about Ferrothorn or any other special wall (Giratina will never come on you, same for Palkia) and you get a free 2HKO/OHKO. If it's not raining, use one of the 3 other move (Fire Blast if you think the steel type is coming, Spacial Rend if there is no Steel, Thunder if you can OHKO something with it; if there is Chansey/Blissey, switch on Excadrill. He is simply here to wreck shit.</li>

      <li>Moveset:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Swords Dance</strong> - We could have used Rapid Spin, and it's viable, but SD is more useful since it allows us to be put the pressure on the opponent and can sweep if needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Substitute</strong> - What makes our Excadrill a boss. It allow him to rape Gira(-O); if allowed a free set-up, he can be easily at +2 ... WITH a sub. Useful against Ferrothorn, who can try to leech seed your face, and sometimes against Mewtwo under sand to bring him on the EQ range.</li>

      <li><strong>Why this Pok√©mon?</strong>
        <ul class="no-style">
          <li>A thunder resist was needed, and a steel type too. Excadrill combines the two of them; not only that, but he can also setup on them ! He's the base of our pivoting that we use for our defense. He's often the one who opens a path for Arceus by hurting Skarm/Gira.</li>

          <li>A homemade spread that has became common by now, sadly. Enough in HP to make Substitute unbreakable by Seismic toss, enough in defense that allow the sub to survive Giratina-O's Dragon-Tail Adamant, full Atk, and finally enough Speed to outspeed any 90 bs stall and Deo-A under sand. The special defense allow us to take 2 Fire Blast under rain.</li>

      <li><strong>How does it work?</strong>
        <ul class="no-style">
          <li>He's got a lot of purpose. First of all, he's our main weapon against the most common stallmons (Lugia, Giratina, Chansey, Ferrothorn, Forretress) since he can setup on them and put a lot of pressure on the opponent. So against stall, it's not that difficult to kill/hurt Giratina/Ferrothorn, which can lead to a Kabutops sweep. However, do not try to setup when the opponent has Groudon on his team ! When facing offense, we need Excadrill to check Dragons, mostly Zekrom, and Thunder. He's not a sweeper, just a wrecking ball against them.</li>

          <li>Since rain teams were the main archetype in Uber, he was somewhat the sweeper we dreamed of. Keeping the rain isnt difficult, his dual STAB is extremely good, the only cons : he doesnt hit THAT hard, but the team compensates for this. Kabutops was chosen instead of Kingdra because of his Rock type; a Normal resist is really useful for Arceus. Also, the metagame is more specially oriented, so something like Kabutops can really shake things up. Also, he doesn't need to be locked on Outrage for killing Kyogre, and his greatest advantage is Low Kick, really, FUCK YOU Ferrothorn, you heard that ? Fuck you !</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Pulling off an offensive team in Ubers is anything but an easy task. Unlike stall teams that try to cover as many threats and have as many resistances as possible, offensive teams will often have at least one type they are weak to. This means that a single mistake or misprediction can be a pain to recover from. In exchange, however, offensive teams put TONS of pressure on the foe by grabbing all the momentum they can have. These teams are extremely hard to pull off, but hey, once you do pull them off, there is no happier man than you!</p>
<p>Unlimited Victory Works is the perfect example of an offensive team. While the team is awfully weak to Fighting- and Grass-type moves, the team gets literally all the momentum by constantly hitting hard or setting up on a foe that took a teammate down, such as Choice Scarf Garchomp against Excadrill, who is setup fodder for Arceus. The team took quite a long time‚Äî6 months‚Äîto make, and is also a joint team.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>Basically, the idea is to pull off a Kabutops clean sweep late-game. Kabutops's great base 115 Attack and Swift Swim ability allow it to tear teams apart with its STAB moves: Stone Edge and Waterfall. These are only resisted by Ferrothorn, which is easily 2HKOed by Low Kick. Kabutops is definitely a destructive sweeper in rain. However, since Kabutops has no way to boost its Attack, it's going to need the opponent's team greatly weakened before trying to pull off the sweep. Have no fear, however, as this team is perfectly designed for this!</p>
<p>Tyranitar is the one that kicks off the match. In fact, it's a fantastic anti-lead in Ubers. Thanks to its wide movepool and high offenses, it can defeat a wide variety of leads, such as Dialga and Deoxys-S. The main idea behind Tyranitar is to land some damage, and then set up Stealth Rock. By luring in Skarmory and 2HKOing it with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage, Tyranitar has given Kabutops an open path to sweep. Kyogre is there to simply change the weather to rain, which doubles Kabutops's Speed. It is also a fantastic revenge killer that can hit extremely hard with its STAB Water Spout. Kyogre also puts many threats in check: Groudon, Mewtwo, Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and more, with its STAB and coverage moves: Thunder and Ice Beam.</p>
<p>Then there's Palkia and Excadrill. The dragon and the mole. Sounds like a cute tale, isn't it? Well, I wish it would be cute to face these two. Choice Specs Palkia is definitely one of the strongest powerhouses when used in rain, and heck, even out of it if not using its Water STAB. Back in the HGSS era, everyone was so excited when Palkia got Hydro Pump: "OMG IT CAN 2HKO BLISSEY IN RAIN WITH 1 SPIKES AND SR LOOOOOL". Then everyone completely forgot about it. Go10 and Private utilized its rain-nuking powers to punch huge holes in the foe's team, making Kabutops's sweep easier. Excadrill is another key member. By using Substitute, it can set up on any Giratina unless it uses Roar over Dragon Tail. Substitute blocks Will-O-Wisp, and Dragon Tail does not break it either, allowing Excadrill to grab a Swords Dance boost and have a field day with the foe's team, again softening it up for Kabutops.</p>
<p>And last but not least: Arceus. Arceus serves a few roles on this team: a) backup sweeper, b) revenge killer, and c) a Kabutops preparation sweeper. Arceus is that one thing that pops to every Ubers player when saying "strong physical attacker that can do tons of damage." Thanks to its high bulk, Arceus can set up on various threats that bother the team: Garchomp that bother Excadrill, Palkia that counter Kyogre, and more. With the vast amount of Pokemon that use Draco Meteor, Arceus can take advantage of that Special Attack drop to set up a Swords Dance, and start hitting hard, mitigating Kabutops's sweep or just cleaning. Simple as that.</p>

<h2>Threats</h2>
<p>Despite how threatening the team is, there are a few threats that can stand up to it. Strong physical attackers can take the team's momentum by setting up and starting to wreak havoc. Prime examples would be Groudon, Garchomp, Rayquaza, and Terrakion. All four pack at least one unresisted move (for everyone but Rayquaza it's their STAB move!) and a way to set up, though Choice Scarf Terrakion also puts up a fight for the team. The most threatening one is Groudon, however. If it can grab a Rock Polish boost, something is getting killed or is taking a TON of damage. Its STAB Earthquake is not resisted by any of the team members, which is why its so threatening. If it also landed a Swords Dance boost, may God have mercy on your soul. Calm Mind Arceus are also problematic, where Grass is the most prominent one. It can come in on Excadrill, Choice-locked Kyogre, or Palkia, set up a Calm Mind and Recover the lost health. The only way of taking it down is catching it on the switch-in with Kyogre or Palkia, or relying on Kabutops and Arceus to 2HKO it. Ghost and Fighting Arceus also deserve a mention due to their great STABs and coverage.</p>
<p>But enough with the offense, let's talk defense. There are a few defensive threats that can hold this team for a long while. StallTwo can sponge an attack from Kabutops, burn Arceus, and threaten the team with its STAB Psychic, while also Recovering its health. Unless it has Light Screen, Kyogre and Palkia are the only ones to stop it. If Gliscor manages to get behind a Substitute, such as against a Choice-locked Thunder from Palkia or Kyogre, it can take the team's momentum, and start Toxic-stalling stuff to death, and no one on this team enjoys being poisoned. The combination of Skarmory and Grass Arceus is also a pain, as the team mainly relies on revenging Grass Arceus with Kabutops and Arceus‚Äîa strategy that is stopped by Skarmory. This core even gets tougher when backed up by Giratina and Chansey; Chansey can take Palkia all day thanks to her high Special bulk, and Giratina is a fantastic backup wall to stand against Kabutops and Arceus.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unlimited Victory Works is a perfect example of an innovative Ubers Hyper Offensive team. The momentum it gains, by either the swift change from sand to rain, having fantastic revenge killers in Kabutops, Excadrill, and Arceus, or wielding the pressure with a lot of hard-hitting Pokemon: Palkia, Kabutops, Excadrill, and Arceus, is so precious to offensive teams. By utilizing creative sets, such as SubSD Excadrill, and forgotten sets, namely Choice Specs Palkia, Go10 and Private's team proves to us all that they still do have their place in the metagame.</p>
