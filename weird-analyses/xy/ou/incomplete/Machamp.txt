* Ice 2hkos gliscor and defensive landorus-therian after intimidate. it also ohkos garchomp and salamence while 2hkoing dragonite with multiscale. Bullet punch is a valuable albeit weak priority move which may come in handy sometimes such killng focush sash users lke zam.

* Earthquqke can be used to hit aegislash w/o the fear of king's shield.

* Poison jab can be used if your team is having problems with fairies.

Set Details
========

* No Guard is the only ability machamp should ever use as it is its only niche.

* 252 attack evs with an adamant nature to maximize your attack. 4 spe to outspeed minimum speed blissey. 252 hp evs to maximise its bulk.

* assault vest boosts its special defense so that it can take a fire blast from charizard-y in sun and ko back with stone NEVER-MISS edge. It can also take a +3 surf from manaphy. +2 thundurus never ohkos while you always ohko with stone edge.

Usage Tips
========

* Come in on resisted hits and hit hard with dynamic punch and see the target kill itself.

* If you predict a ghost- or psychic-type switchin go for the knock off as even if you mispredict something will be crippeled.

* This set is best used on balanced teams.

* It is best used midgame as a pivot.

* It is also a very good antilead as focus sash deoxys-s with 252spA evs never ohkos while you kill it with the knock off / bullet punch combo and against other leads just use dynamic punch.


Team Options
========

* It is wreaked by burn so something to take will-o-wisp is welcome. Talonflame is a good option as it also takes care of mega-venusaur.

* Heal bell support is appreciated. Celebi is a very good option as it has very good synergy with machamp. Although it stacks weakness to flying types.

* A strong pursuit user to take care of psychics and ghosts.

* Talonflame check like Heatran and Rotom-w. Heatran gets a special mention as it resists all of machamp's weaknesses.



Other Options
#########

* Guts set.
* Choice scarf.
* Rest-Talk
* sub+3 attacks

Checks & Counters
########

* Mega-Venusaur fears nothing from machamp.

* Will-o Wisp cuts its attack into half and is very detrimental. Sableye is a very good option as it is immune to dynamic punch.

* Talonflame can easily KO with piority brave bird although should be wary of stone edge.

* Psychic types and flying types.
