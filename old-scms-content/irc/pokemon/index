<p>#pokemon is Smogon's official IRC channel for the very game that brought us all here. Here at #pokemon, we discuss metagame trends, tiering policy, and all of your favorite Pokemon. While many places may ask you to lurk before posting, we encourage quite the opposite. Participation from all users is key because we at #pokemon stand by the notion that no voice should go unheard when the decisions and discussions made and brought up affect all of us. Be sure to read the <a href="/irc/rules">Rules</a> and attempt to be a positive influence on the chat. By doing so, you'll end up with status in no time!</p>
