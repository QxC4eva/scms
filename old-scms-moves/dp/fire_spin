[SHORT DESC]
Traps and damages over multiple turns.

[LONG DESC]
<p>This move lasts for 2-5 turns as a passive effect, so the user can choose other moves after using this while it is still in effect. It does 1/16 damage at the end of the turn for each turn in effect, and prevents the target from switching. The effect goes away when the user switches, even if the 2-5 turn counter isn't up. The end-of-turn effect does not thaw frozen Pokemon.</p>
