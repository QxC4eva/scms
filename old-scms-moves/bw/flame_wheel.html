10% chance to burn opponent. Thaws the user.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to burn the target. If the user is frozen, using this move will thaw it out immediately.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Flame Wheel should not be used competitively. The thawing of the user is an unnecessary effect since Freeze is the least common status condition. Flame Wheel's Base Power is far too low as well, and is outclassed by stronger moves such as Fire Punch and Flare Blitz.</p>
