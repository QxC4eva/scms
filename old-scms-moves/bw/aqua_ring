<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user recovers 1/16th of its max HP each turn. This effect is removed when the user switches. The effect of this move can be passed by Baton Pass.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Aqua Ring is not a move seen frequently in competitive play. It is very rare that a Pokemon would stay in long enough to benefit from this move more than it would from another recovery move, or from simply setting up or attacking. This move may see a little use on some pure stallers in conjunction with other recovery such as from Leftovers&mdash;for instance, a Walrein in hail could become even more annoying after having set up with Aqua Ring. Though Aqua Ring may sound useful for a Baton Passing team, given the frequent use of Substitute, frequent switching into entry hazards, and that Vaporeon, a very useful Baton Passer, learns it, Ingrain almost entirely outclasses it in this regard.</p>
