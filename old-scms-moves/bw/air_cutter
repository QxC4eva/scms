[SHORT DESC]
Has a high critical hit rate.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a critical hit rate one stage higher than normal. Assuming there are no other critical hit modifiers in play, this move has a 1/8 chance to get a critical hit instead of a 1/16 chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Low power, even lower competitive worth. As far as special Flying-type attacks go, Air Slash is pretty much better in every single way (competitively speaking). For the Flying-types that actually get it and could actually do some damage with it, Togekiss and Shaymin-S have Air Slash, Lugia has Aeroblast, Dragonite has Hurricane, and Salamence really has better things to be doing with its time.</p>
