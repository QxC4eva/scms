
Overview
########

    Forretress can set up all kinds of hazards.
    It can also use Rapid Spin.
    Great defensive typing in Bug/Steel, with only one weakness.
    Amazing Defense stat.
    Can use Volt Switch (YU NO GET U-TURN) to gain momentum in addition to Spinning.
    Lacks offensive presence.
    Low Special Defense and abysmal Speed.
    No reliable recovery.
    With the buff to Defog, many teams find themselves no longer needing a Rapid Spinner. Defog also gives more ways to remove Forretress's own hazards.

Moves
========

    Rapid Spin is the main reason to use Forretress.
    Forretress can lay down Stealth Rock or Spikes very well.
    Volt Switch allows Forretress to act as a pivot as well as a Spinner, can be used to scout, and can be used to escape its counters.
    Gyro Ball is Forretress's main attack and allows Forretress to KO Pokemon such as Terrakion and Mamoswine easily.
    Earthquake is an option to lure in Magnezone, Aegislash, and Heatran, and hit them hard on the switchin. However, Forretress cannot actually OHKO those mons with Earthquake, and they will OHKO back.
    Protect is an option, especially for defensive teams who like to scout the moves of certain Pokemon, such as Banded Talonflame, Scarfed Genesect, Espeon, and Deoxys-S. It also stalls for Leftovers recovery, making Forretress slightly more durable.
    Toxic may be used to hit Jellicent and Gourgeist on the switch and cripple them, but most of Forretress's counters are either immune to Toxic (Aegislash, Gengar, Heatran, Magnezone, Ferrothorn), or don't care about it (LumHarvest Trevenant, Gliscor).
    Running both hazards at once is a viable option, but this requires removing either Gyro Ball or Volt Switch, removing a lot of Forretress's utility.

Set Details
========

    The EVs maximize physical bulk. The 0 Speed IV and Relaxed Nature allows Gyro Ball to hit as hard as possible.
    Toxic Spikes is an option if your team needs it, but it is mostly inferior because Steels are so popular, Excadrill and Defoggers can get rid of them for no cost, and Mega Venusaur can simply absorb them.
    It is possible to run both hazards along with Rapid Spin, but without Volt Switch it cannot pivot and without Gyro Ball it cannot threaten any opponents.
    Overcoat is generally very useful for Forretress because it allows it to absorb Spores and helps against Hail. Most notably, it completely crushes Smeargle.
    Sturdy is useful as well, in certain last-ditch situations, so that Forretress can get an emergency KO or one last Spin.

Usage Tips
========

    Forretress is a great defensive Rapid Spinner.
    It can switch in on many physical attackers, and can either set up hazards or Spin them away.
    Forretress can also act as a pivot with Volt Switch. It can switch in, and use a slow Volt Switch to bring in a teammate for free.
    Gyro Ball allows Forretress to get KOes, but only on fast frail Pokemon and fast Pokemon weak to it (ex. Mamoswine, Terrakion). Generally, Forretress should not be attacking.
    Although situational, Rapid Spin is a contact move, so Iron Barbs, Rocky Helmet, and Rough Skin will hurt Forretress. Also, if Forretress faints to one of them while Spinning, the Spin does not work. If you really need to Spin in front of Ferrothorn, only do it once and get out.

Team Options
========

    Forretress's team support opens up many team options.
    Sweepers who appreciate hazards, such as Dragonite, Mega Lucario, and Mega Charizard X, benefit from Forretress.
    Pokemon weak to SR, such as Charizard, Talonflame, and Dragonite, appreciate Forretress's Rapid Spin.
    Pokemon that can defeat spinblockers are very helpful.
    As Forretress has no recovery of its own, a Wish passer would make a good teammate, so Forretress can come in over and over throughout the course of the match.

Other Options
########

    Hazard lead may be used, but Custap Berry is unreleased.
    Specially defensive set.
    Red Card, Shed Shell, Mental Herb
    Hidden Power Ice is an option, but it fails to 2HKO offensive Garchomp, Dragonite, and Salamence without Special Attack investment.

Checks & Counters
########

    Magnezone can get rid of it very easily.
    Taunt and Magic Bounce stop it from setting hazards.
    Bulky Ghost-types such as Aegislash, Trevenant, Gourgeist, and Jellicent block Rapid Spin and prevent Forretress from doing anything.
    Setup sweepers, for the most part, can set up on it. Just watch out for Gyro Ball.
    Fire-type moves will destroy Forretress.
