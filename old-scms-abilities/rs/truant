[LONG DESC]
<p>When this Pokémon is sent out, it will not be able to attack on every other turn, starting with the second. An exception to this is when the Pokémon with the Truant ability is brought in to replace an ally that fainted to end-of-turn damage, this Pokémon loafs the first turn, then attacks the second.</p>
