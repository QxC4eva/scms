[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the power of all of the holder's damage-dealing Rock-type attacks by 20%. If Sudowoodo breeds while holding Rock Incense, a Bonsly Egg will be produced as opposed to a Sudowoodo Egg.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rock Incense is practically identical to Hard Stone, as they both boost Rock-type moves by 20%. In any case, Rock Incense is not used much in competitive battles. It is often outclassed by items such as Choice Band and Choice Specs, which boost the power of physical and special moves by 1.5, respectively, and Life Orb, which boosts the power of all moves by 1.3. Although these three items do come with negative effects, it is generally better to use them over a Rock Incense.</p>
