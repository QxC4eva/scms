<p>The Smeargle's Studio Gallery is a collection of artwork chosen by the forum moderators &mdash; selected from the variety of threads in the Studio &mdash; which will be updated every month for your viewing leisure. We'll also provide a short summary of why we think the artwork is so great (though it should be obvious!) and the reasons why we've picked them.</p>

<p>The aim of this project is to showcase the ever-changing trends and artists of Smeargle's Studio, and hopefully to show the best of what Smogon's talent has to offer! Maybe, one day, this will form the basis of your thesis on the progression of art. Then again, maybe not. Anyway, enjoy!</p>
