<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder does not take damage from sandstorm and hail.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There is almost always a better option on any Pokemon. While it is nice to be able to confidently throw something with Overcoat onto a hail or a sandstorm team, the only notable Pokemon you would use, <a href="/bw/pokemon/forretress">Forretress</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/reuniclus">Reuniclus</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/escavalier">Escavalier</a>, are either Steel-type, or in the case of Reuniclus, have <a href="/bw/abilities/magic_guard">Magic Guard</a>, which far outclasses Overcoat.</p>
