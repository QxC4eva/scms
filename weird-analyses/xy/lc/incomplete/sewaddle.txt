Overview


All in all this little bug might not see much usage due to the increasing popularity in Spinarak and Surskit. It's six weaknesses, and middling speed make it hard to come in and set up. However Sewaddle has boons in defensive prowess, which the other two fall short, Grass typing's new immunity to powder moves, and the crux of it's usage, Sticky Web.

SET
Sticky Web Setter
##############
move 1: Sticky Web
move 2: Energy Ball
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Air Slash
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Eviolite
evs: 156 HP / 196 Def / 40 SpA / 116 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Sticky Web starts off this set by slowing down the grounded opponents Pokemon by one stage. This allows for an easier sweep for slower, powerful Pokemon. Energy Ball is the Primary STAB option. Hidden Power Fire is to hit enemy Steels such as Ferroseed who might come in to ruin your set up, and it is further powered up by the Sun. Hidden Power Ice could be an option to also hit Ground / Grass types. Flying types arent affected by Sticky Web so you wont be hitting them.

Set Details
========

The combination of EVs allow for multiple switches into Stealth Rock with maintaining bulk. Bold is to take better physical hits. Chlorophyll is used since Overcoat is quite redundant with the new immunity to powder moves. Sewaddle isnt going to really be on Sand teams either. Swarm is also slightly bad since we want longevity to set Sticky Web and to hit hard with our moves now while we have the chance.

Usage Tips
========

Set up Sticky Web when you can. Coming in on Water / Fighting / Ground to sap up the resisted hits is usually the best way to go. Natu is the only Magic Bouncer in the tier, obviously our worst nightmare. A good thing that is hit supereffectively by Hidden Power Ice. Any non-Eviolite Natu will have to setup Screens or Roost and risk being trapped by a friendly Dark Pokemon with Knock Off / Pursuit. Sewaddle is also the only Sticky Web use who doesnt have to rely on Focus Sash since it has the defenses to take a few hits. Unless they are Fire or Flying of course.

Team Options
========

Vulpix is partner number one. Although sun aggravates his fire weakness though, but it doubles it's speed. Pokemon resistant to Fire and Flying moves are the next best things. Steels like Pawniard, and Magnemite and Waters like Slowpoke and Mantyke can absorb these hits while Sewaddle can take those Electric, and Ground attacks aimed at them. Rock types like Archen and Tyrunt also x4 resist Fire and Flying moves so they as well make excellent defensive partners. Also do not forget slower Pokemon who can utilize Sticky Web to sweep. Once again Pawniard, and even Meinfoo, Meditite, and Timburr make good offensive teammates. Offensive Sun partners who appreciate some slow down are Solar Power Charmander and Helioptile. Getting a free Choice Specs boost and move freedom is a massive boon.

Other Options

A Gimmicky Life Orb Chlorophyll set consisting of SolarBeam/Hidden Power Ice/Bug Buzz/Air Slash is a choice. You can even use Calm Mind to boost it's tankibility. Sewaddle has good support move in Sunny Day which helps his/her fellow Chlorophyll Pokemon speed up. It's also notable that Sewaddle has access to Agility, Iron Defense, Calm Mind and Baton Pass as well. It can use these moves to pass multiple boosts to it's teammated, aiding in a full chain with Torchic. Bug Buzz is another STAB option but there's not a lot it will hit. Mostly Purrloin and Psychics you outspeed while in Sun. Lastly, Sewaddle gets Magic Coat but it's illegal with Sticky Web and the only real reason to run Sewaddle is for Sticky Web.

Checks & Counters

**Multiple Weaknesses**:Sewaddle has six weaknesses. All slightly common attacking types too. Even with semi high defenses, there is no taking an unSTABed Fire or Flying move.

**Stealth Rock and Status**:Sewaddle hates Stealth Rock, it strips a quarter of it's health away, and is also not fond of status.

**Taunt / Defog**: Defog and Taunt are two moves that makes Sewaddle semi useless and set up bait. There is no retaliation unless you are Purrloin. Since Bug Buzz will maim you.

**Specially Bulky Pokemon** It's also notable that any Pokemon with great special bulk can wall the set and set up. Misdreavus and Munchlax is able to tank anything Sewaddle has and set up their sweeps. Spritzee can also come in on this set and set up Wishes and offensive boosts.
