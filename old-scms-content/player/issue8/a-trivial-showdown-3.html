    <li>There are this many PS public rooms devoted to Other Metagames.</li>
    <li>This Player article has the most co-illustrators excluding the Staff Interviews.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Puzzles</h2>
<div id="format" class="align-center"><p>Question: Hint</p></div>
<p><strong>Easy</strong> - Hangman. Fill out the rest of the word according to the hint.</p>

<ol>
    <li>_ _ a _ _ _ _ _: PS global staff member.</li>
    <li>_ _ _ _ _ _ a _ _ _ _: PS public room.</li>
    <li>_ _ a _ _ _ _ _ _: Former PS global Mod.</li>
    <li>_ _ _ a _ _ _ _ _ _: PS public room Owner.</li>
    <li>_ _ _ a _ _ _ _ _: Former PS Leader/Admin.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Medium</strong> - Anagrams. Switch around the order of the letters to receive a PS-related answer (ex. Need Hug Gun would be Hugendugen).</p>

<ol>
    <li>A Repent Blob Flutist: PS user and a room he/she owns.</li>
    <li>Tent Glob Dots: PS user and a room he/she is a Mod in.</li>
    <li>Luck Lie Due: Pok&eacute;mon and the ladder on which it was #1 in usage in December 2014.</li>
    <li>Airplane Bed: PS global Mod and a Pok&eacute;mon in his/her custom avatar.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hard</strong> - "Psywaves" Questions. Use the clues to find synonyms to complete the full word. Be careful because this type of question is based on pronunciation. For example, when a clue is "A Letter" the letter may be "R" but be spelled "ar" in the word. (ex. "Onomatopoeia + Hole + A" Letter would be Pupitar. Pew + Pit + Ar)</p>

<ol>
    <li>Street + Hill + Ones: Battle format on PS.</li>
    <li>Two + Preposition + Religious symbol: Former PS global Mod.</li>
    <li>Limit + Expert + Throw: PS public room.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Bonus Question!</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Take the only PS global Mod whose username starts with a "W" and find the first thread he posted in on Smogon. Find the Pok&eacute;mon in the user's avatar that posted 4 posts after his in the same thread. This Pok&eacute;mon was another user's old PS username. Take this user's global rank number (Voice = 1 Driver = 2 etc.) and multiply it by the national dex number of his/her favorite Pok&eacute;mon. Take this number and subtract from it Smogon user Phizzlax's user number. Find the Pok&eacute;mon that has this national dex number and the final answer is the PS user has that Pok&eacute;mon in his/her custom avatar.</li>
</ul>
