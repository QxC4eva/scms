<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to paralyze the target. Damage is boosted to 1.2x by the ability Iron Fist.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>ThunderPunch is a reliable move when the recoil from Wild Charge is undesirable. Otherwise, Wild Charge is considerably stronger and should be used over ThunderPunch most of the time. Medicham and Toxicroak could, however, see some use for ThunderPunch as a coverage move against certain troublesome Water- or Flying-type Pokemon, most notably Gyarados.</p>
