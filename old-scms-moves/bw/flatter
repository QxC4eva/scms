<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Confuses the target. Boosts the target's Special Attack by one stage. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Flatter should not be used competitively. Its counterpart, Swagger, is a high risk, high reward move that takes advantage of the confusion by boosting the target's Attack. As confusion damage is not calculated using the Special Attack stat, Flatter is effectively useless.</p>

<h2>Related Moves</h2>
