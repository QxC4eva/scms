<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/211.png" alt="Qwilfish" /><br />
Qwilfish @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Poison Point<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Taunt</p>

<p>I was always a fan of suicide spiker leads in UU starting way back to when I whored out Smeargle in UU. Believe it or not I was never a fan of Froslass, but the fact that Froslass got banned got me thinking about what leads could possibly fill the same role of being able to lay spikes and do more to benefit the team on top of that. I of course tried out Omastar and Cloyster but I wasn't really a fan of either of them. The first few times I used Qwilfish I was just in love. Explosion of a reasonable attack means that if I ever see a Pokemon I dislike I can just boom on it. Even if I didn't get spikes down at all I would at the very least take out a Pokemon that gave me problems. But as a spiker, Qwilfish seemed to me to be as good as if not better than Froslass was at its peak, especially with so many Milotic running around meaning it could easily come in later in the game if need  be.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/199.png" alt="Slowking" /><br />
Slowking @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Own Tempo<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 56 SpA / 200 SpD<br />
Calm nature (+SpD, -Atk)<br />
- Slack Off<br />
- Surf<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Thunder Wave</p>

<p>Moltres was suspect in the previous round, so it was hard to build a team without taking into consideration the fact that it could fuck you up hardcore if you weren't prepared for it. So a bulky water was almost a necessity. Originally I decided on Slowking because it had Nasty Plot and I could threaten a late game sweep against stall if need be. However I found myself almost never using Plot and decided that paralysis support would be infinitely better for my team...which it was.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/57.png" alt="Primeape" /><br />
Primeape @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Vital Spirit<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Rock Slide</p>

<p>I've always been a big fan of ScarfApe in UU. Ability to switch into sleep moves, scarfed U-turn and a pretty powerful Close Combat makes him an extremely efficient scarfer for UU. Ice Punch is to revenge DD Altaria and Rock Polish Torterra I think, I've never had the situation arise but I think I outspeed who knows. Usually I just suicide Torterra against opponent Torterra. I used to have Punishment but ditched it for Rock Slide because I liked the last ditch effort against Scyther and Moltres and has definitely come in handy more times than I can count.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/115.png" alt="Kangaskhan" /><br />
Kangaskhan @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Scrappy<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SAtk)<br />
- Return<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Hammer Arm<br />
- Aqua Tail</p>

<p>I was just reminiscing on a few rounds of UU ago back when the standard core among better players was Yanmega / Donphan / Kangaskhan. I loved Kanga back then and had no idea why it dropped in usage since there didn't seem to be any metagame changes that would result in Kanga being any worse. So I decided to just throw it on a team with hazard support and see if it still fucked teams up as much as it used to. And lo and behold it does. It can absolutely run through teams even with no support. It is by far the best choice user in the tier if you ask me. Aqua Tail is for Rhyperior which gives my team a bit of trouble and I've caught a lot of them off guard because really who imagines a Kangaskhan's tail can turn into water?</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/392.png" alt="Torterra" /><br />
Torterra @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Overgrow<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD<br />
Careful nature (+SpD, -SpA)<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Wood Hammer<br />
- Synthesis<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>Originally this slot belonged to Donphan. I wanted a pocket monster that could set up SR and pack a bit of a punch behind that. Donphan was pretty underwhelming though. It could switch in on very little and the lack of recovery was really a debbie downer. The light came to me one day when I was playing LN and he was using this set and the motherfucker just wouldn't die. I thought about it for a second and realized shit that Pokemon would be perfect for my team. I made the switch and never looked back.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/484.png" alt="Rotom" /><br />
Rotom @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Spe / 252 SpA<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Charge Beam<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Shadow Ball</p>

<p>Um what more can I say about this than I clearly have a massive hardon for all forms of SubCharge Rotom. On this team it serves as a spin blocker that packs a punch and can run through stall as long as it doesn't have Steelix! Great Pokemon that can do equally well against both stall and offense. Sometimes it can be underwhelming but in the long run it does what it needs to do and that's why in OU and UU I constantly go back to it.</p>

<p>At first glance, Jabba's team is a bit strange, boasting 3 NU Pok&eacute;mon including a lead Qwilfish. However, this team was very successful despite it seeming like an odd team at first glance, peaking in 1st place with 1720 CRE. Spikestacking has always been a dominant strategy in UU, although it seems to have died down a little with the absence of Froslass in the tier. Jabba proved with this team that offensive Spikestacking is still perfectly viable, laying down Spikes and throwing out hard hitters like Choice Band Kangaskhan and Choice Scarf Primeape, whilst still maintaining a solid defensive core via Slowking and Torterra.</p>

<p>Qwilfish, as previously mentioned, is Jabba's lead. Besides being able to lay down layers of Spikes, Qwilfish also helps by preventing Stealth Rock or Spikes from being layed by bulkier leads such as Omastar. Qwilfish is also useful later in the game, being able to come out and lay Spikes on bulky Water-types such as Milotic, or weaker Pok&eacute;mon like Spiritomb. Explosion helps Jabba should he be in a pinch against a bulky set up sweeper like Nasty Plot Slowking, as well as  being useful in general to eliminate troublesome Pok&eacute;mon to Jabba's team (Leafeon, anyone?). Jabba shortly touched on how Qwilfish's role was previously filled by both Cloyster and Omastar, and it's very likely that Qwilfish works better due to both Taunt and the fact that it maintains a faster pace than the slower, bulkier Omastar and Cloyster. Qwilfish can keep spinners at bay at least for a little bit in fear of Explosion, as it will severely weaken spinners like Blastoise and Hitmontop, preventing them from being able to successfully Rapid Spin. By keeping them away for a bit, Jabba can wait until near end game to reveal his ace in the hole, Sub Charge Rotom.</p>

<p>Jabba's main backbone of defense comes from the combination of Slowking and Torterra. Synergy wise, they work very well, with Slowking easily beating most Fire-types (bar Houndoom) who Torterra has trouble with, while Torterra provides a rather safe switch in to most physical Dark-types like Drapion and Absol, as well as Electric- and Ghost-types like Manectric and Mismagius. Slowking gives paralysis support to the team, which is always welcome to help slow down frail sweepers, leaving them susceptible to Choice Band Kangaskhan later on in the game. Slowking is also a very solid hard counter to Azumarill, only fearing a Choice Banded Return / Double Edge, which would allow Rotom a free Substitute and potential to cause havoc. Torterra can make an easy switch into slower defensive Pok&eacute;mon like Registeel, allowing Torterra a free turn to Stealth Rock while generally forcing Registeel out with the threat of Earthquake. With a specially defensive EV spread, Torterra is capable of surviving many random special attacks, such as Defensive Milotic's Ice Beam, Rotom's Hidden Power Ice, and +2 Mismagius Life Orb Shadow Ball, which is quite a surprise to most ladder players.</p>

<p>Leading the charge on the offensive end of the spectrum are 2 Choiced attackers, Primeape and Kangaskhan, both of which can easily abuse Spikes. Kangaskhan, as Jabba mentioned, doesn't even need Spikes to sweep, easily 2HKOing most of the tier after the opposing Steel-type is removed, and thanks to Scrappy it can just keeping attacking if a Ghost-type comes in, an advantage it yields over every other Normal-type Choice Bander (barring Miltank, whom I don't see with a CB set very often..). Primeape's powerful Close Combat is generally enough to force switches against more frail Pok&eacute;mon, and Primeape is the main source of revenge killing on Jabba's team, revenge killing Rock Polish Rhyperior, Aggron, Swords Dance Absol, and Rock Polish Torterra to name a few. Of course, U-turn is infinitely useful for scouting and racking up Spikes damage, as well as getting easy opportunities for Rotom and Kangaskhan to come in and easily start an offensive assault.</p>

<p>Lastly, Jabba includes his favorite Pok&eacute;mon (no matter what tier he is playing!), Substitute Charge Beam Rotom. Rotom also acts as the spinblocker for the team, and abuses Spikes damage rather well. Just about all of Sub Charge Rotom's counters in UU are grounded and do not take a liking to Spikes, specifically Steelix, Drapion, and Specially Defensive Torterra. If given the opportunity to set up against stall, Rotom will easily 6-0, especially behind both entry hazards and Choice Band Kangaskhan. Rotom gets numerous set up opportunities on Choiced Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, which are plentiful in the tier. Rotom can also set up on weaker bulky Pok&eacute;mon like Registeel, thanks to its resistance to Iron Head and immunities to Earthquake and Explosion.</p>

<p>It goes without saying, however, that even a good team has its fair share of weaknesses. Jabba's biggest weakness is Swords Dance Leafeon, who gets a fair share of chances to set up, notably against Torterra, Primeape's Rock Slide, and Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch and Aqua Tail. Once Leafeon gets a boost, it is very hard for Jabba's team to beat, outspeeding everything bar Primeape, whom will have trouble denting Leafeon thanks to its 130 base Defense. Swords Dance and Choice Band Scyther both have the potential to give Jabba trouble, especially if Jabba can't manage to keep Stealth Rock on the field. Rock Polish Rhyperior can also cause a fair amount of damage, but Scarf Primeape can take a decent chunk out of it with Close Combat, and Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch will KO it when it gets low on HP. Rhyperior will also likely have to hit 2 Megahorns in succession against Torterra and Slowking, and has little opportunity to set up in general. Weaknesses aside, JabbaTheGriffin yet again brings us a team strong enough for the Featured Rate My Team!</p>
