<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If Poliwhirl is traded while holding this item, it will evolve into Politoed. If Slowpoke is traded while holding this item, it will evolve into Slowking. All moves that actively deal damage and do not already have a chance to flinch will gain a 10% chance of flinching the opponent. (This chance doubles to 20% if the holder has Serene Grace.) This effect does not stack with Stench, and is not affected by Sheer Force.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>King's Rock is best used with Pokemon that have the Skill Link ability and can use a variety of multi-hit moves. Cloyster is a notable example, as it can use Shell Smash and either Icicle Spear or Rock Blast to tear through the opponent's team. Assuming the attack hits, Cloyster will have a 41% chance of flinching the foe. Another example is Cinccino, which can use King's Rock along with moves such as Tail Slap or Bullet Seed. Aside from these Pokemon, King's Rock is generally a bad item to use in competitive battles.</p>
