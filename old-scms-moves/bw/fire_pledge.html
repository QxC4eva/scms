<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. If one of the user's allies chose to use Grass Pledge or Water Pledge this turn and has not moved yet, they take their turn immediately after the user and the user's move does nothing. Power triples if this move is used by an ally that way, and a sea of fire appears on the target's side if the first move was Grass Pledge which causes non-Fire-type opponents take 1/8 of their max HP as damage at the end of each turn, or a rainbow appears on the user's side if the first move was Water Pledge which causes this Pokemon and its allies to have twice the chance of side-effects occurring, but this effect does not stack with Serene Grace. These special field effects last four turns. Does not consume Fire Gem when used.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Fire Pledge is fairly useless in singles play, as all of the Pokemon that have access to it have Flamethrower and Fire Blast as superior options. However, in doubles, it can be used together with Water Pledge to double the effect chance of your side's moves. This can allow Pokemon on your side with flinching moves to act as a pseudo-Jirachi, abusing the 60% chance of your opponent flinching. This can also be used to take advantage of additional statuses when attacking. However, it does not stack with Serene Grace, so Jirachi itself cannot abuse the strategy.</p>

<p>When used together with Grass Pledge, Fire Pledge provides additional residual damage. This helps to wear down the opponent, although stall is not as effective a strategy in doubles, so this strategy is less effective.</p>
