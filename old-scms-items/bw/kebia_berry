Reduces damage from a super effective Poison-type attack by 50%. Consumed after use.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by a Pokemon, reduces the power of a damaging Poison-type move that would hit the holder for super effective damage by 50%. Consumed after use. If the holder uses the move Natural Gift, this Berry will provide a one-time 60 Base Power Poison-type attack.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Kebia Berry should not be used at all in competitive battles, as the only type that is hit super effectively by Poison-type moves is Grass. Many Grass-type Pokemon themselves have a secondary Poison typing, and those that do not, such as Celebi and Shaymin, would rather use a more beneficial item.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Receive from Fennel on first visit to Dream Worldâ€”however, you only get one of the seventeen damage-reducing Berries, and this event cannot be repeated. If you do not receive a Kebia Berry in this way, you must trade for it using Share Shelves in the Dream World.</p>
