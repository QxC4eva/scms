<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This article is meant as an informative collection of brief summaries of each Pokemon seen in the UU metagame and what they are capable of doing. If you ever need to get a quick idea of what you're up against when you see a Pokemon in a UU match, the below descriptions will be very helpful to you.</p>

<h2><a name="threatlist">Threat List</a></h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/359.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Absol</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Pressure / Super Luck<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 130 Atk / 60 Def / 75 SpA / 60 SpD / 75 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Absol is most commonly seen as a Swords Dance sweeper. With Night Slash as a primary STAB attack, Superpower as a coverage move, and Sucker Punch as a strong priority attack, Absol is extremely dangerous to defensive and offensive teams alike. Occasionally, Choice Scarf Absol is used as a quick way to get rid of Ghost-type Pokemon while doubling as a decent revenge killer. Absol's weak spot is its frailty, as even neutral STAB attacks without EV investment can deal well over 50% to it.</dd>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/306.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Aggron</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Sturdy / Rock Head<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 110 Atk / 180 Def / 60 SpA / 60 SpD / 50 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>With the addition of Head Smash from HGSS, Aggron has become quite a fearsome physical attacker. The Rock Polish set is the most common, since it patches up Aggron's low Speed and allows it to abuse its extremely powerful Head Smash; this set commonly uses coverage moves, including Aqua Tail, Low Kick, or Ice Punch. Aggron can also run an effective Choice Band set due to its massive physical bulk and resistances to somewhat common attacking types. Finally, a SubPunch set capitalizes on Aggron's resistances and, with Magnet Rise, allows it to defeat some of its common counters, such as Donphan.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/65.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Alakazam</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Synchronize / Inner Focus<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 50 Atk / 45 Def / 135 SpA / 85 SpD / 120 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Alakazam is the proud owner of the highest Special Attack stat and the third highest Speed stat in UU. The common Choice Specs set uses both of these to their fullest extent, breaking through teams with its raw power, Speed, and decent coverage. This set typically uses Psychic, Trick, and two of Focus Blast, Shadow Ball, Signal Beam, and Grass Knot. Alakazam sometimes runs a Substitute Life Orb 3 Attack set that capitalizes on its Special Attack and Speed while gaining the ability to switch attacks. Alakazam also has a wide array of support moves, including Taunt, Encore, Reflect, Light Screen, and Trick. Encore deserves a mention as a popular auxiliary move on offensive sets, as it can garner Alakazam free turns to set up and prevents Pokemon from using Sucker Punch effectively.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/334.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Altaria</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Natural Cure<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 70 Atk / 90 Def / 70 SpA / 105 SpD / 80 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>As the only UU Dragon-type Pokemon (bar various NFEs), Altaria's offensive and defensive sets both have niches in the metagame. Defensively, its handy resistances and numerous support moves, including Heal Bell, Perish Song, and Roar, are a godsend to many stall teams. Offensively, Altaria's Dragon Dance set lets it wreak havoc with STAB Outrage and Earthquake for coverage. Choice Band and Mixed Attacker Altaria work as wallbreakers by striking common switch-ins for much more damage than expected.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/429.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Ambipom</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Pickup / Technician<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 100 Atk / 66 Def / 60 SpA / 66 SpD / 115 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Ambipom primarily serves as a quick Normal-type attacker, usually equipped with a Silk Scarf or Life Orb and some combination of Fake Out, Return, Pursuit, Payback, U-turn, Low Kick, and Taunt. When used as a lead, Ambipom usually runs Taunt to prevent entry hazards from being set up, but when used as a cleaner, a coverage option is more valuable. Its high Speed, decent Attack stat, and hit-and-run nature make this set extremely effective against offensive teams, while it can use Taunt to disrupt defensive ones. The drawback to offensive Ambipom is that it will end up either walled by Ghosts (if it lacks a Dark-type move), walled by Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon (if it lacks Low Kick), or ineffective at maintaining offensive momentum (if it lacks U-turn). Ambipom is also able to Baton Pass both Agility and Nasty Plot.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/59.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Arcanine</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Flash Fire / Intimidate<br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 110 Atk / 80 Def / 100 SpA / 80 SpD / 95 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>An extremely balanced stat spread and a surprisingly wide movepool make Arcanine one of the most versatile Pokemon in the tier. Its offensive sets make the most of STAB Flare Blitz and priority in ExtremeSpeed. Offensive sets also use both abilities equally well, since Intimidate turns Arcanine into a check for many physical sweepers while Flash Fire can give Arcanine a massive power boost. Lastly, with Morning Sun along with Intimidate, Roar, Toxic, and Will-O-Wisp at its disposal, defensive Arcanine can check a large portion of UU sweepers.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/144.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Articuno</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Pressure<br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 85 Atk / 100 Def / 95 SpA / 125 SpD / 85 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>While Articuno's 4x Stealth Rock weakness and Ice subtype may initially be off-putting, it is an extremely specially bulky Pokemon who works well as a Toxic and Pressure staller. Articuno's SubRoost set, typically accompanied by Toxic and Ice Beam, finds easy setup opportunities on a wide range of specially offensive Pokemon, including Milotic, Slowbro, and Venusaur. Articuno can also use Heal Bell over either Substitute or Toxic to heal its team of status afflictions.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/184.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Azumarill</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Huge Power / Thick Fat<br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 50 Atk / 80 Def / 50 SpA / 80 SpD / 50 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Assuming a boosting nature and 252 EVs, Azumarill has nearly as much Attack as Groudon and Rayquaza with enough natural bulk to make it a solid choice for offensive teams seeking a bulky yet powerful Water-type Pokemon. Azumarill is commonly seen holding a Choice Band with a moveset including four of Waterfall, Aqua Jet, Ice Punch, Double-Edge, and Superpower. Its SubPunch set is not as powerful, but is more flexible than the Choice Band set; it carries Substitute, Focus Punch, and some combination of Waterfall, Aqua Jet, and Ice Punch. Finally, some players simply choose to run the same moves as the Choice Band set, but with Leftovers, to provide more survivability.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/9.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Blastoise</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Torrent<br />
Base Stats: 79 HP / 83 Atk / 100 Def / 85 SpA / 105 SpD / 78 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Blastoise's access to Rapid Spin sets it apart from other bulky Water-types. Surf and Rapid Spin are standard on almost every Blastoise, who sometimes uses Ice Beam or Hidden Power Grass as coverage moves in addition to utility moves such as Yawn, Toxic, Roar, and Rest. Blastoise is also able to use the vaunted Foresight + Rapid Spin technique to defeat spinblockers. Choice Scarf and Specs sets are rare, but Water Spout sets Blastoise's offensive sets apart from those of other Water-types.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/257.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Blaziken</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Blaze<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 120 Atk / 70 Def / 110 SpA / 70 SpD / 80 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>High offensive stats and decent Speed make Blaziken a dangerous physical and special attacker. A mixed wallbreaker set with Fire Blast, Hidden Power Grass, Superpower, and Vacuum Wave uses its great stats to break down defensive teams. Swords Dance sets with Flare Blitz, Low Kick, and ThunderPunch or Stone Edge are a nightmare for stall to face, since they can OHKO even Milotic without the aid of entry hazards. To patch up its mediocre Speed, Choice Scarf is sometimes used with mixed attacking moves.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/332.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Cacturne</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Sand Veil<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 115 Atk / 60 Def / 115 SpA / 60 SpD / 55 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Cacturne is a Pokemon used nearly exclusively in a sandstorm due to its ability, Sand Veil. Its most common set uses Substitute along with Sucker Punch, Focus Punch, and either Swords Dance or Seed Bomb to abuse Sand Veil's evasion increase. Variations of this set sometimes use Leech Seed over one of the attacks. Cacturne has equal attacking stats, making Nasty Plot sets with Dark Pulse and Energy Ball viable. Although Cacturne is usually seen in an offensive role, it can also serve as a Spikes user.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/113.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Chansey</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Natural Cure / Serene Grace<br />
Base Stats: 250 HP / 5 Atk / 5 Def / 35 SpA / 105 SpD / 50 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>In UU, Chansey performs the same role as Blissey does in the upper tiers. It is an excellent special wall with the classic set of Wish, Protect, Seismic Toss, and Toxic. However, to provide more consistent team support, a utility set with Stealth Rock, Softboiled, Seismic Toss, and one of Aromatherapy, Thunder Wave, or Toxic is also popular. The first set is able to give Wish support to its teammates, while the second provides Stealth Rock and serves as a cleric.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/6.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Charizard</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Blaze<br />
Base Stats: 78 HP / 84 Atk / 78 Def / 109 SpA / 85 SpD / 100 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Charizard has a surprisingly large number of attacking options for a Fire-type. Although its Attack stat is the lower of its offensive stats, Charizard is able to use Dragon Dance, Swords Dance, and Belly Drum to boost it. Its physical movepool includes Fire Punch, Flare Blitz, Thunderpunch, and Earthquake. Physical Charizard are usually Belly Drum variants, holding a Salac Berry and knowing Substitute, Fire Punch, and either Earthquake or Thunderpunch. Although BellyZard is the "classic" Charizard set, its Special Attack stat is actually much higher than its Attack stat; thus, some players choose to use Charizard as a special sweeper with Fire Blast, Air Slash, Hidden Power Grass, and Roost. Focus Punch is an option on specially oriented sets to surprise and KO Chansey.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/344.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Claydol</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Levitate<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 70 Atk / 105 Def / 70 SpA / 120 SpD / 75 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Claydol is unique as a Rapid Spinner because it resists Stealth Rock and is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. As a utility Pokemon, both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin are staples on almost all Claydol sets. As far as attacking options go, Earth Power and Psychic provide reliable STAB options while Shadow Ball complements Rapid Spin by hitting most Ghost-types who try to spinblock super effectively. Explosion allows Claydol to hopefully take an opposing Pokemon down with it after it has done its job. Claydol also receives the support moves typically given to all bulky Psychic-types in Trick, Reflect, and Light Screen.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/36.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Clefable</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Cute Charm / Magic Guard<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 70 Atk / 73 Def / 85 SpA / 90 SpD / 60 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>The coveted Magic Guard ability, which prevents all indirect damage, transforms Clefable from an otherwise unassuming Normal-type blob into one of the most consistent defensive Pokemon in UU. There is no true standard set of four moves; players instead usually choose the four moves that fit their team best out of a pool of Clefable's commonly used moves. These moves are: Encore, Softboiled, Wish + Protect, Seismic Toss, Facade, Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Heal Bell / Aromatherapy. Clefable usually carries a damaging move, a status inflicting move, a form of recovery, and a wildcard (Encore, Heal Bell / Aromatherapy, or Protect).</dd>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dd>Since Magic Guard prevents all indirect damage, including Life Orb recoil, offensive Clefable is also used. There are two offensive variants to look out for: a wallbreaker set that uses Fire Blast, Grass Knot, Double-Edge, and Softboiled, and a Calm Mind set with Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Softboiled. Clefable is typically a pain for defensive teams because of its immunity to residual damage. Although defensive sets don't pose much of an immediate threat, offensive sets are very efficient at putting lots of pressure on stall teams.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/91.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Cloyster</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Shell Armor / Skill Link<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 95 Atk / 180 Def / 85 SpA / 45 SpD / 70 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Despite its horrific Special Defense and HP stats, Cloyster's astronomical Defense stat and access to Spikes and Rapid Spin give it a niche on many teams. There are two distinct Cloyster variants. Offensive versions commonly use Life Orb and have heavy Attack EV investment; they carry some combination of Ice Shard, Explosion, Rock Blast, Surf, and Spikes. Defensive Cloyster usually have EVs in HP and Special Defense and use a combination of Surf, Ice Beam, Spikes, Rapid Spin, Rock Blast, and Payback. The difference between the two is that the offensive version aims to heavily damage the other team while possibly sneaking in Spikes, while the defensive version instead focuses on laying Spikes and using Rapid Spin.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/346.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Cradily</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Suction Cups<br />
Base Stats: 86 HP / 81 Atk / 97 Def / 81 SpA / 107 SpD / 43 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Cradily is most commonly seen as a defensive anchor on sandstorm teams. Its Grass subtype grants it neutrality to Water-, Ground-, and Grass-type attacks, which gives Cradily an advantage over similar Pokemon like Regirock. The most dangerous Cradily set is a mono-attacker with Curse, Rest, Sleep Talk, and either Rock Slide or Seed Bomb. Once Cradily gets going, it can be hard to stop since Suction Cups prevents Cradily from being forced out through Roar or Whirlwind. A traditional wall with Toxic, Recover, Rock Slide, and Seed Bomb is seen sometimes, but is generally inferior to the first set since it doesn't present much of an offensive threat. Cradily also has access to Stockpile and Swords Dance, but Curse is usually preferred since it results in a more balanced stat spread when considering Attack, Defense, and Special Defense.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/232.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Donphan</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Sturdy<br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 120 Atk / 120 Def / 60 SpA / 60 SpD / 50 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Pretty much the only Donphan set that is used in UU is the bulky Rapid Spin set. Despite its one-dimensional nature and perhaps as a direct result of it, Donphan performs its job very well. Even though the most common Donphan spreads use max Attack, it still retains tons of physical bulk, allowing it to switch into many of UU's physical threats. Donphan almost always run both Earthquake and Rapid Spin, and must choose between Stealth Rock, Ice Shard, Head Smash, Roar, and Assurance to fill the last two moveslots.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/457.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Drapion</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Battle Armor / Sniper<br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 90 Atk / 110 Def / 60 SpA / 75 SpD / 95 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Drapion's most common set is the Swords Dance sweeper. Crunch and Earthquake are on every offensive set, and its coverage options include Aqua Tail, Ice Fang, and Poison Jab. Both all-out Life Orb sweepers and balanced variants who hold Leftovers and use Taunt instead of a coverage attack are common. Sometimes, Drapion uses Scope Lens and Night Slash / Cross Poison to abuse its Sniper ability. Defensive Drapion sees some use in UU due to its rare typing, which affords it an immunity to Psychic and resistances to Ghost and Dark at the cost of only one weakness to Ground-type attacks. These sets usually run some combination of Crunch, Toxic Spikes, Whirlwind, Earthquake, Taunt, Rest, and Sleep Talk.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/431.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Drifblim</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Unburden / Aftermath<br />
Base Stats: 150 HP / 80 Atk / 44 Def / 90 SpA / 54 SpD / 80 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Drifblim is frequently seen as Mismagius's inferior. However, this Ghost has a few tricks up its sleeve that Mismagius doesn't, such as Unburden, Baton Pass, and Explosion. Since Unburden doubles Drifblim's Speed after it uses its item, sweeping sets utilizing Calm Mind also commonly use either Rest + Chesto Berry or Substitute + Petaya Berry. Drifblim can Baton Pass Calm Mind boosts quite well due to its high base HP, which allows it to make 101 HP Substitutes, but unfortunately cannot Baton Pass the Unburden boost. Finally, on sweeper sets, Explosion can be used to hopefully take out an opposing Pokemon when Drifblim is low on HP.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/51.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Dugtrio</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Sand Veil / Arena Trap<br />
Base Stats: 35 HP / 80 Atk / 50 Def / 50 SpA / 70 SpD / 120 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Arena Trap gives Dugtrio a unique offensive support niche by granting it the ability to trap all grounded enemy Pokemon not holding Shed Shell. Despite a lackluster Attack stat, Dugtrio's STAB Earthquake synergizes well with Arena Trap and lets Dugtrio prey on common defensive Pokemon, such as Registeel and Chansey, as well as many offensive ones, such as Blaziken, Drapion, and Houndoom. Dugtrio's most commonly held item is a Life Orb, which helps ensure that Flying-type and Levitating Pokemon don't get free setup. Choice Band can still be used, however, for greater damage output—including a guaranteed 2HKO on Chansey. Dugtrio's most commonly used moves are Earthquake, Stone Edge, Night Slash, Sucker Punch, and Beat Up, while Substitute is usually used on Life Orb sets to evade opposing Sucker Punches and priority moves.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/101.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Electrode</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Static / Soundproof<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 50 Atk / 70 Def / 80 SpA / 80 SpD / 140 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Electrode is almost always used as a fast supporter designed to gain momentum for Rain Dance teams. The standard moveset usually consits of Rain Dance, Thunder, Taunt, Hidden Power Water, and Explosion. Electrode mostly run Damp Rock, since their high Speed means they usually don't have to worry about getting OHKOed before they can set up Rain Dance. However, a Focus Sash can be used instead to guarantee that Electrode will always survive to use Rain Dance against Choice Scarf leads.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/103.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Exeggutor</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Chlorophyll<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 95 Atk / 85 Def / 125 SpA / 65 SpD / 55 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Exeggutor's massive Special Attack, excellent dual STABs, and ability, Chlorophyll, make it an ideal special sweeper for Sunny Day teams with a standard moveset of Psychic, SolarBeam, Sleep Powder, and Explosion. Its decent physical bulk and unique resistances also make it an appealing choice for non-weather bulky offense teams. When compared to the similar Venusaur, Exeggutor trades lower Special Defense and Speed for a resistance to Ground and greater Defense. Other Grass-types such as Torterra, Leafeon, and Tangrowth miss out on Exeggutor's high Special Attack stat and fantastic dual STABs. When not used on a Sunny Day team, Exeggutor's usual moveset is Psychic, Leaf Storm, Sleep Powder, and Synthesis. Exeggutor can even set up Trick Room to make the most of its low Speed. Finally, it also has a decent Attack stat and physical movepool (including Swords Dance, Wood Hammer, Zen Headbutt, and Low Kick that it can put to use), although mixed and physical sets are rare.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/160.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Feraligatr</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Torrent<br />
Base Stats: 85 HP / 105 Atk / 100 Def / 79 SpA / 83 SpD / 78 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Feraligatr is very predictable but still quite hard to stop. Feraligatr often abuses its high Attack and impressive bulk by using setup moves such as Dragon Dance and Swords Dance. With Dragon Dance, Feraligatr generally uses Waterfall, Ice Punch, and Earthquake with a Life Orb. Bulkier Dragon Dance sets might choose to use Waterfall, Return, and Substitute along with Leftovers or a Liechi Berry. Swords Dance versions use either Waterfall, Ice Punch, and Earthquake, or Waterfall, Return, and Aqua Jet.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/424.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Floatzel</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Swift Swim<br />
Base Stats: 85 HP / 105 Atk / 55 Def / 85 SpA / 50 SpD / 115 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Floatzel is the fastest Swift Swim Pokemon in the game. On sweeping sets, Waterfall and Return provide perfect coverage while Aqua Jet is a valuable priority attack. Generally, Floatzel carries one of Bulk Up or Taunt in its sets. Floatzel can also Baton Pass both Bulk Up and Agility. Taunt can be used on lead sets to prevent the setup of entry hazards or on sweeper sets to prevent walls from recovering HP or inflicting status.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/368.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Gorebyss</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Swift Swim<br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 84 Atk / 105 Def / 114 SpA / 75 SpD / 52 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Gorebyss is likely to be seen on Rain Dance teams only, where it can overcome its Speed issues. Its most notable advantages over other rain sweepers are its high Defense, resistance to Water-type attacks, and neutrality to Fighting-type attacks, which allow Gorebyss to withstand Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and other priority attacks. Gorebyss also benefits from its ability to beat Toxicroak with Psychic. Its most common moveset is Surf, Hidden Power Grass, Ice Beam, and Psychic. Aqua Tail is also an option to 2HKO Chansey. Despite its use as a sweeper, Gorebyss has a versatile Baton Pass set that focuses on passing Amnesia, Iron Defense, or Aqua Ring.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/297.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Hariyama</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Thick Fat / Guts<br />
Base Stats: 144 HP / 120 Atk / 60 Def / 40 SpA / 60 SpD / 50 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Hariyama's massive HP and Attack stats are put to good use by its sets. Its most common set abuses its ability, Guts, with a Toxic Orb and runs Close Combat, Payback, Ice Punch, and Bullet Punch, which gives Hariyama perfect type coverage. If used in the lead position, Fake Out is sometimes used over Ice Punch. Due to its naturally high HP, SubPunch sets with some combination of Payback, Ice Punch, and Stone Edge are effective. Substitute sets may invest in Hariyama's defenses to create Substitutes that common defensive Pokemon cannot break, even with STAB attacks. Hariyama's only boosting move is Bulk Up, which it can use quite well. Finally, Thick Fat gives Hariyama a unique set of resistances resulting in it sometimes using defensive sets with Force Palm, Rest, Sleep Talk, and either Whirlwind or Knock Off.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/106.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Hitmonlee</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Limber / Reckless<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 120 Atk / 53 Def / 35 SpA / 110 SpD / 87 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Hitmonlee is one of the most dangerous Fighting-type sweepers in UU because of its excellent Attack, Speed, and priority moves. Hitmonlee usually carries either Choice Band, Choice Scarf, or Life Orb. Hitmonlee always runs Close Combat and Stone Edge and uses two of Sucker Punch, Mach Punch, Blaze Kick, and Earthquake as its coverage options. Its Limber ability also allows it to check the many common users of Thunder Wave in UU.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/237.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Hitmontop</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Intimidate / Technician<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 95 Atk / 95 Def / 35 SpA / 110 SpD / 70 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Hitmontop is used either as a Rapid Spinner or a cleaner / revenge killer. Rapid Spin variants choose to use Intimidate because it gives Hitmontop more opportunities to switch in. Foresight, Close Combat, and Rapid Spin are its mandatory moves, while the common options for the last slot are Rest, Sucker Punch, Stone Edge, and Mach Punch. Offensive variants of Hitmontop utilize Technician and Life Orb in tandem with Hitmontop's excellent slew of priority attacks. Fake Out and Mach Punch are almost always seen on the set, while two of either Bullet Punch, Sucker Punch, Stone Edge, and Close Combat are used as the remaining moves.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/229.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Houndoom</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Flash Fire / Early Bird<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 90 Atk / 50 Def / 110 SpA / 80 SpD / 95 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Houndoom's unique dual STABs and access to Nasty Plot make it a popular special sweeper. The majority of its sets run Nasty Plot, Fire Blast, and Dark Pulse. The choice of the final move and item lets the Houndoom user specialize a bit. With a Life Orb and Sucker Punch, Houndoom plays a bit suicidally but gains the ability to defeat Dugtrio. A Passho Berry, potentially with Hidden Power Grass, lets Houndoom defeat most Milotic, Kabutops, and Azumarill. Beat Up OHKOes Chansey, who otherwise wears down Houndoom with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Houndoom also has a very acceptable Attack stat, so a mixed set with Pursuit easily dispatches defensive Ghosts; Pursuit is usually used with Sucker Punch, Fire Blast, and Crunch or Dark Pulse.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/189.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Jumpluff</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Chlorophyll / Leaf Guard<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 55 Atk / 70 Def / 55 SpA / 85 SpD / 110 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Jumpluff is often overshadowed by the other Grass-types of UU due to its nonexistent offensive stats. While it may seem cute and harmless, looks can be deceiving! With access to disruptive moves such as Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, Encore, Leech Seed, Aromatherapy, and Memento, Jumpluff is one of the best UU supporters. Its most common set is the annoying SubSeed set, which carries Sleep Powder and Encore to facilitate setup. It is also an effective weather starter for Sunny Day teams due to its fast Sleep Powder.</dd>

<strong>Jynx</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Oblivious / Forewarn<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 50 Atk / 35 Def / 115 SpA / 95 SpD / 95 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>With fairly good Speed and Special Attack stats alongside powerful STAB attacks in Ice Beam and Psychic, Jynx can be a very threatening sweeper. It can run a variety of sweeping sets but is most commonly seen using a mono-attacking set of Nasty Plot, Ice Beam, Lovely Kiss, and Substitute. This set allows Jynx to protect itself with Substitute, put prospective counters to sleep, and attack with boosted Ice Beams. Some more defensive variants of this set employ Calm Mind, trading immediate power for the ability to set up on specially-inclined walls. The most offensive variants employ a Life Orb and Focus Blast over Substitute to attain greater coverage and power. Regardless of the set, Jynx's boosted attacks let it hit like a very pretty truck, and it is quite capable of quickly dismantling slower offensive teams.</dd>

<strong>Kabutops</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Battle Armor / Swift Swim<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 115 Atk / 105 Def / 65 SpA / 70 SpD / 80 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Kabutops often sees use on rain teams, where it can abuse its untouchable Swift Swim-boosted speed and a set of Waterfall, Stone Edge, Swords Dance, and Aqua Jet. The same set is seen outside of rain teams as well, and while Kabutops's Speed is mediocre without Swift Swim, its powerful STAB attacks and priority maintain it as a potent threat. Kabutops is sometimes seen as a lead with Stealth Rock, Aqua Jet, Stone Edge, and Rapid Spin with Focus Sash. This Kabutops can often foil early-game efforts to get entry hazards down. Finally, mid-game Rapid Spin sets are effective at ridding the field of entry hazards for offensive teams.</dd>

Base Stats: 105 HP / 95 Atk / 80 Def / 40 SpA / 80 SpD / 90 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Kangaskhan is mostly used as a strong Normal-type attacker, either with Choice Band or Life Orb. Its ability, Scrappy, lets it hit Ghost-type Pokemon with Normal- and Fighting-type attacks. Kangaskhan always carries Double-Edge with either Low Kick or Hammer Arm, which yields perfect coverage due to Scrappy. Fake Out, Sucker Punch, Aqua Tail, and Return normally fill the last two slots. Kangaskhan also runs a SubPunch set effectively due to its ability to make 101 HP Substitutes with Substitute, Focus Punch, Return, and Sucker Punch.</dd>

<strong>Lanturn</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Illuminate / Volt Absorb<br />
Base Stats: 125 HP / 58 Atk / 58 Def / 76 SpA / 76 SpD / 67 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Lanturn has a very large support movepool, impressive bulk, and a unique typing. Offensive Lanturn sets often make use of 101 HP Substitutes and Charge Beam while retaining lots of natural bulk. Most defensive Lanturn carry some form of paralysis, either via Discharge or Thunder Wave, in addition to Surf and possibly Ice Beam. In the last slot, Lanturn generally uses a support move such as Confuse Ray or Heal Bell. Lanturn sometimes uses Rest and Sleep Talk for recovery; in these cases, it uses Discharge and Surf as attacks.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Leafeon is mostly known for being a lethal Swords Dance sweeper. Leaf Blade and Return or Double-Edge provide stellar two-move coverage, while Wish or Synthesis grants it reliable recovery. Leafeon can also foil many of its hard counters by Baton Passing its Attack boosts, or beat status-reliant counters through Heal Bell. It also has an excellent base 130 Defense stat, which is often put to good use through a defensive set that utilizes Wish + Protect, Leaf Blade, and either Roar or Heal Bell.</dd>

<strong>Linoone</strong></p>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Linoone is one of the best Belly Drum users in the game. It sports two qualities that distingish it from the wannabes: Gluttony, which activates pinch Berries at 50% instead of 25% HP, and STAB ExtremeSpeed, which makes Linoone extremely hard to revenge kill. ExtremeSpeed is usually used with Shadow Claw and Seed Bomb for coverage, but Return is sometimes seen as an answer to the extremely bulky Pokemon who can survive a +6 ExtremeSpeed.</dd>

<strong>Lopunny</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Cute Charm / Klutz<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 76 Atk / 84 Def / 54 SpA / 96 SpD / 105 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Lopunny's high Speed, unique and uncommon ability, and wide movepool make it an effective supporter. Klutz is Lopunny's trump card, as it means Lopunny is not affected by held items—including Choice items. The core of its disruptive sets are Encore and Switcheroo, which allow it to set up Substitutes that it can Baton Pass to a teammate. Lopunny also has access to Heal Bell and Thunder Wave, which can fit on sets that choose not to use the Substitute + Baton Pass strategy.</dd>

<strong>Ludicolo</strong></p>

Base Stats: 80 HP / 70 Atk / 70 Def / 90 SpA / 100 SpD / 70 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Ludicolo is another of those Pokemon whose usage is usually limited to Rain Dance teams, where it can abuse its Swift Swim ability and attempt a sweep. Ludicolo's access to Grass-type STAB moves lets it take on the bulky Water-types who usually wall rain sweepers. Ludicolo's most common role is as a special sweeper who employs Surf, Ice Beam, Energy Ball, and Rain Dance. Running Focus Punch is a possibility to get past Chansey and Clefable. Ludicolo often abuses its lower Attack stat with a Swords Dance set packing Waterfall, Seed Bomb, and either Ice Punch or Zen Headbutt. On the rare occasions Ludicolo is used outside of rain, it is usually seen as a special tank with Leech Seed.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Magmortar is one of the toughest Pokemon to switch into because of its monstrous Special Attack stat and excellent coverage. Magmortar is generally seen as a Life Orb sweeper, but also often carries a Choice Scarf. Fire Blast and Thunderbolt are Magmortar's bread-and-butter attacks, while a Hidden Power is always used for coverage. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Altaria, Hidden Power Grass hits Quagsire and Rhyperior, and Hidden Power Water hits Rhyperior and Arcanine. Either Focus Blast or Cross Chop is usually used in the last slot; with a Life Orb, Cross Chop 2HKOes Chansey.</dd>

<strong>Magneton</strong></p>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>With high Special Attack and a useful ability in Magnet Pull, Magneton makes an effective sweeper and Steel-type killer. Due to Magneton's shallow movepool, it is always seen with Thunderbolt and a Hidden Power type of choice. When seen as a Steel Trapper, Magneton carries the moves Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Fire, Substitute, and Magnet Rise. As a special sweeper, Magneton is usually seen carrying Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Grass / Ice / Fire, Charge Beam, and Substitute / Explosion. Magneton can use a Choice Scarf to patch up its mediocre Speed; this set carries the mandatory Thunderbolt + Hidden Power along with Flash Cannon and Explosion.</dd>

<strong>Medicham</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Pure Power<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 60 Atk / 75 Def / 60 SpA / 75 SpD / 80 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Pure Power is literally the source of Medicham's power. With an Adamant nature and 252 EVs, it reaches a massive 568 Attack stat. Medicham is most used as a Choice Scarf revenge killer, sporting a moveset of Zen Headbutt, High Jump Kick, ThunderPunch, and Ice Punch. Medicham is sometimes seen running a Life Orb set with either the same attacks or Substitute instead of Ice Punch. Such a set can power through walls such as Milotic and Weezing. Medicham's frailty is often its undoing, so just about any Pokemon that can survive an attack and retaliate is a good check.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Mesprit is often used as a lead to set up Stealth Rock and beat other common leads with its respectable Special Attack stat and wide movepool. Common moves on lead Mesprit include Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, Psychic, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Grass Knot, and U-turn. The choice of which attacks are used depends on which specific threats a player wants to hit. Alternatively, Mesprit's Choice Scarf set with Trick can be used in the lead slot. Mesprit also has access to Calm Mind, which it can use on a set with Psychic, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam.</dd>

<strong>Milotic</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Marvel Scale<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 60 Atk / 79 Def / 100 SpA / 125 SpD / 81 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Milotic is one of the most reliable Pokemon in UU because of its excellent defensive stats and access to Recover. Milotic runs Surf and Recover on almost all of its sets, with two of Hidden Power Grass, Ice Beam, Toxic, and Haze in the remaining slots. Rest and Sleep Talk are also options to allow Milotic to take advantage of Marvel Scale and negate Toxic. Milotic can even run an offensive set with its auspicious base 81 Speed and decent Special Attack. Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Grass are quite threatening when combined with Milotic's massive natural bulk.</dd>

<strong>Miltank</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Thick Fat / Scrappy<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 80 Atk / 105 Def / 40 SpA / 70 SpD / 100 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Miltank's role depends on which ability it chooses to run. If it has Scrappy, you can count on either the bulky Leftovers set with Curse, Milk Drink, Return / Body Slam, and Hammer Arm / Heal Bell, or the fast Life Orb set with Milk Drink, Return / Double-Edge, Earthquake, and either Rock Slide or Zen Headbutt. If it has Thick Fat, expect a bulky support set with Leftovers and Heal Bell, Milk Drink, Stealth Rock, or Thunder Wave as support moves. The most dangerous set is arguably the Curse set, as it has perfect neutral coverage along with Milk Drink to heal off residual damage; also, since most Fighting-type moves are physical, Curse helps Miltank deal with its only weakness.</dd>

<strong>Mismagius</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Levitate<br />

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Mismagius is one of the most threatening sweepers in UU due to its excellent Speed, Special Attack, and coverage. Mismagius is most often seen using either Nasty Plot or Calm Mind in tandem with Substitute or Taunt. Since the combination of Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball is only resisted by Steelix in UU, Mismagius generally runs those two attacks. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to deal with Steelix and Registeel more effectively, though. Mismagius can also use Trick with Choice Specs, in which case Mismagius will almost always run Shadow Ball, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Ground in the remaining three slots for the best coverage possible. In addition to these offensive sets, Mismagius can run a bulky spinblocker set. For this set, Mismagius carries Shadow Ball as its main attack along with Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Pain Split.</dd>

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Moltres is one of the most dangerous special attackers in UU. When equipped with Life Orb, it has the ability to 2HKO the majority of UU with a moveset of Fire Blast, Air Slash, Hidden Power Grass, and Roost. Moltres is also capable of running a set of Substitute, Roost, Toxic, and Flamethrower to beat many of its common counters, such as Milotic and Chansey. This set is particularly effective because Flamethrower hits almost every Pokemon immune to Toxic for super effective damage.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Nidoking is a diverse threat because of its vast movepool. As a specially oriented mixed attacker, Nidoking usually runs Earth Power, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Superpower, making it hard to find a perfectly safe switch-in. Nidoking also has a powerful physical set with Earthquake, Megahorn, Stone Edge, and Sucker Punch. While sweeping or wallbreaking sets are its most common sets, Nidoking has a good lead set that uses Stealth Rock, Earth Power, Thunderbolt / Ice Beam, and Taunt.</dd>

<strong>Nidoqueen</strong></p>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Nidoqueen's main perks lie in its respectable support movepool and unique defensive typing. Nidoqueen's standard moveset consists of Earth Power / Earthquake, Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, and a filler—either Ice Beam, Roar, Taunt, or Stone Edge. In spite of Nidoqueen's decent offensive stats, running an all-out attacker set is better left to Nidoking, who packs a better movepool and better offensive stats.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Ninetales is one of the fastest Fire-types in UU, and its combination of Speed, bulk, and power make it a threatening sweeper. Ninetales is almost always seen as a Nasty Plot sweeper with Fire Blast and Energy Ball as its main attacks. The last slot is occupied by either Hidden Power Rock, which hits fellow Fire-type Pokemon, or Hypnosis, which can put a counter out of commission. Ninetales also has access to Will-O-Wisp, Roar, and Grudge, but support sets are rare.</dd>

Base Stats: 70 HP / 60 Atk / 125 Def / 115 SpA / 70 SpD / 55 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Omastar is stall's preferred Spikes user; its high Defense enables it to set up on a decent number of Pokemon. In addition to Spikes, Omastar can set up both Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes. Omastar usually runs two entry hazards along with Surf and Ice Beam for offensive coverage, although it occasionally uses Rest, Hidden Power Grass, or Protect instead of Ice Beam. Omastar is also an effective suicide Focus Sash lead due to its access to all of the entry hazards. Finally, Omastar has the highest Special Attack of all the UU Water-type Pokemon, making it an effective rain sweeper. Sweeping sets typically use a set of Surf, Ice Beam, Hidden Power Grass, and Earth Power.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Pinsir is not a very common sight in UU matches, but it has several niches that it fulfills excellently. It has access to Stealth Rock, X-Scissor, Stone Edge, Close Combat, and Earthquake, making it a sturdy lead. Lead sets usually use the first three moves along with either Close Combat or Earthquake. Access to Swords Dance and decent Speed means that Pinsir can also be used as a respectable physical sweeper. Both of its abilities are useful, as Mold Breaker allows Earthquake to ignore Weezing's and Rotom's Levitate and Rhyperior's Solid Rock, while Hyper Cutter blocks Arcanine's and Hitmontop's Intimidate.</dd>

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Poliwrath is a Pokemon who faces tough competition from many other Water-types. While it doesn't excel either offensively or defensively, Poliwrath's balanced stats and Water Absorb ability make it viable. Its most common set is the SubPuncher, composed of Substitute, Focus Punch, Waterfall, and Encore. It can run Ice Punch over Waterfall or Encore to hit Venusaur and Torterra for more damage. Poliwrath also has the option of using Bulk Up, either on a mono-attacking RestTalk set or on a three attack set.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Primeape is a solid choice for many teams looking for a Fighting-type because of its immunity to sleep-inducing moves and access to U-turn. Generally, Primeape uses a Choice Scarf set, which makes a great revenge killer and late-game cleaner. It always runs U-turn and Close Combat, while the last two slots can be filled by two of Stone Edge, Ice Punch, and Punishment.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Quagsire's rare typing and ability, Water Absorb, give it many useful resistances, allowing it to wall many common attack combinations. Defensive sets usually run Recover, Earthquake / Waterfall, and two of Encore, Toxic, and Yawn. Quagsire can also choose to use Curse and Recover to set up for a sweep; those sets choose from Earthquake, Waterfall, Rock Slide, and Ice Punch for attacks.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>A varied movepool and unique typing make Qwilfish one of the more versatile Pokemon of the tier. Its classic set is its Rain Dance sweeper set with Swords Dance, Waterfall, Poison Jab, and Explosion. Qwilfish also sees use as a suicide lead on offensive teams with Taunt, Spikes, Waterfall, and Explosion. Since Qwilfish's typing gives it many useful resistances, bulkier sets that optimize its defenses can be effective Spikes users for more defensive teams.</dd>

<strong>Regirock</strong></p>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Regirock often lives in the shadow of its fellow Rock-types Rhyperior and Aggron, but its balanced defenses and mono-Rock typing give it a few niches of its own. Regirock is often used on sandstorm teams with a moveset of Curse, Rock Slide, Rest, and Sleep Talk; after a boost or two, this set is nearly impenetrable. Outside of a sandstorm, Regirock usually carries Stealth Rock, Stone Edge, Earthquake, and Explosion and invests heavily in Special Defense, allowing it to check a wide variety of dangerous sweepers.</dd>

<strong>Registeel</strong></p>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Registeel's balanced defenses and pure Steel typing makes it a solid defensive pivot. Registeel always invests heavily in Special Defense and is capable of surviving powerful physical and special super effective hits. Most variants of Registeel carry Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave along with an attacking combination—either Shadow Claw + Seismic Toss or Iron Head + Earthquake. Ice Punch, Explosion, and Toxic also have their uses on defensive sets. A boosting set that runs Curse, Rest, Sleep Talk, and Iron Head is not immediately threatening, but can become a very dangerous sweeping threat after a few boosts.</dd>

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Rhyperior can be described as a behemoth in the UU metagame, sporting excellent dual STABs and a great ability, Solid Rock. Its most common sets are: Support, Choice Band, Substitute, and Rock Polish. Essentially all of Rhyperior's sets run Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Megahorn. Support sets use Stealth Rock in the last slot and might use Roar instead of Megahorn to spread entry hazard damage; it can also use Rock Blast to defeat some Substitute users. Choice Band Rhyperior 2HKOes every Pokemon in UU with the proper attack and uses Stealth Rock or Rock Wrecker as the filler move. Substitute and Rock Polish sets use the respective move of the same name in the fourth slot.</dd>

<strong>Rotom</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Levitate<br />

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Although Rotom's movepool is shallow, it is surprisingly hard to counter since most Pokemon that beat its offensive sets hate getting tricked a Choice item or burnt by Will-O-Wisp. Rotom is most commonly seen with a Choice Scarf and Thunderbolt, Shadow Ball, Trick, and Will-O-Wisp or Hidden Power Ice. It can also run a non-Choice offensive set with Substitute, Charge Beam, Shadow Ball, and Hidden Power Fighting or Thunderbolt. Offensive Rotom can also use Substitute, Pain Split, Thunderbolt, and Shadow Ball along with a Life Orb. Defensive Rotom sets are excellent spinblockers and counter several dangerous Pokemon; they usually run Thunderbolt, Will-O-Wisp, and either Substitute + Pain Split or Rest + Sleep Talk for recovery.</dd>

<strong>Sceptile</strong></p>

Base Stats: 70 HP / 85 Atk / 65 Def / 105 SpA / 85 SpD / 120 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Sceptile is a fearsome threat in the UU metagame, primarily due to its versatility. It is able to run physical, special, and mixed sets, and its list of commonly used moves include: Leaf Storm, Leaf Blade, Leech Seed, Hidden Power Ice, Focus Blast, Energy Ball, Dragon Pulse, Earthquake, Rock Slide, Low Kick, Swords Dance, and Synthesis. Specially oriented sets include Choice Specs variants and SubSeed. Choice Specs sets commonly carry Leaf Storm, Hidden Power Ice, Focus Blast, and Dragon Pulse or Energy Ball. SubSeed sets use Hidden Power Ice along with Energy Ball or Leaf Storm in its remaining moveslots. The only purely physical set is the Swords Dance set, which runs Leaf Blade, Earthquake, and Rock Slide as attacks. Mixed sets are truly unpredictable, as they can run any combination of the attacks listed above. A good rule of thumb, however, is that it will always have a Grass-type STAB, a move that hits Grass-types, and a move that hits Steel- and Fire-types.</dd>

<dd>Scyther is a very dangerous sweeper because of its excellent Attack and Speed. It's most commonly seen either carrying Choice Band or using Swords Dance. The Choice Band set runs U-turn, Aerial Ace, and two of Quick Attack, Pursuit, and Brick Break. Swords Dance sets all carry Aerial Ace and Brick Break; for the last slot, some choose to use Bug Bite for bulky Psychics while others choose to use Quick Attack to foil revenge killers. Life Orb is the most common item for Swords Dance Scyther, but Lum Berry can also be useful to prevent status from slowing it down. Finally, Scyther can Baton Pass both Swords Dance and Agility, although it will rarely have the opportunity to pass both together.

<dd>Sharpedo's high attacking stats, great Speed, and horrific defenses make it the epitome of a glass cannon. Its mixed attacking set is the most common and runs Crunch, Hydro Pump, Hidden Power Grass, and either Ice Beam or Aqua Jet. This set gets perfect coverage, making Sharpedo quite difficult to switch into. A set with Focus Sash, Taunt, and three attacks makes a decent attacking lead.</dd>

<strong>Shedinja</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Wonder Guard<br />
Base Stats: 1 HP / 90 Atk / 45 Def / 30 SpA / 30 SpD / 40 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Shedinja is one of the most unique Pokemon in the game. Its ability, Wonder Guard, makes it immune to all attacks that don't hit it for super effective damage—twelve types in all. Unfortunately, entry hazards and any form of residual damage—including damaging weather, Toxic, and Will-O-Wisp—renders Shedinja worthless. Shedinja is usually used with Swords Dance, with Shadow Sneak, Sucker Punch, and X-Scissor as attacks. Shedinja can also use Trick and Will-O-Wisp to surprise its usual counters. While Shedinja can use Baton Pass, using it in tandem with Swords Dance or Agility is an illegal move combination.</dd>

<strong>Skuntank</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Stench / Aftermath<br />
Base Stats: 103 HP / 93 Atk / 67 Def / 71 SpA / 61 SpD / 84 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Skuntank's standard set is a physical attacker. It's always seen running Sucker Punch, Pursuit, and Explosion, while the last slot is a toss-up between Taunt, Crunch, and Poison Jab. Depending on what Skuntank's user requires from it, it can run either Choice Band, Life Orb, or Leftovers.</dd>

<strong>Slowbro</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Oblivious / Own Tempo<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 75 Atk / 110 Def / 100 SpA / 80 SpD / 30 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Slowbro is the premier counter to physical Fighting- and Fire-types due to its high Defense and HP stats and Water / Psychic typing. All of its sets use both Surf and Psychic. Defensive sets add Thunder Wave and Slack Off to the mix, making Slowbro extremely difficult to take down. Slowbro's base 100 Special Attack is no slouch, either. It can utilize a Calm Mind set to boost its average Special Defense stat or a Choice Specs set to pummel typical switch-ins for hard damage. Slowbro also has access to Trick Room.</dd>

<strong>Slowking</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Oblivious / Own Tempo<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 75 Atk / 80 Def / 100 SpA / 110 SpD / 30 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Slowking serves as a reliable counter to many specially inclined Fire-types, most notably Moltres. Much like its brother, Slowbro, defensive Slowking comes equipped with both STAB attacks along with Slack Off and Thunder Wave. Unlike Slowbro, Slowking has access to Nasty Plot, which is often seen with Trick Room to patch up its extremely low Speed. A Choice Specs set identical to Slowbro's can be run as well.</dd>

<strong>Spiritomb</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Pressure<br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 92 Atk / 108 Def / 92 SpA / 108 SpD / 35 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Spiritomb is a versatile foe, as it commonly runs both defensive and offensive sets. Offensive Spiritomb are either Choice Band or mixed versions. Choice Band Spiritomb uses Pursuit, Shadow Sneak, Sucker Punch, and Trick, while mixed sets hold Spell Tag and use Shadow Ball, Pursuit, Sucker Punch, and Hidden Power Fighting. Sometimes, one of these sets will find a spot for Will-O-Wisp for crippling bulkier sweepers. Spiritomb has access to both Calm Mind and Nasty Plot; Nasty Plot is usually used with Shadow Ball, Hidden Power Fighting, and either Pain Split or Rest, while Calm Mind sets are typically Dark Pulse mono-attackers with Rest + Sleep Talk.</dd>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dd>Defensive Spiritomb sets are slightly more versatile, as they can make use of Pursuit, Shadow Sneak, Sucker Punch, Dark Pulse, Shadow Ball, Psychic, Will-O-Wisp, and Toxic. Unfortunately, this wide assortment of attack combinations means there is no reliable way to determine which attacks a specific Spiritomb carries. For recovery, Spiritomb can use Pain Split or Rest + Sleep Talk.</dd>

<strong>Steelix</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Sturdy / Rock Head<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 85 Atk / 200 Def / 55 SpA / 65 SpD / 30 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Steelix is a member of the very select group of UU Steel-types, and is arguably the best out of the three at countering Normal- and Flying-type Pokemon due to its sky-high Defense and lack of 4x weaknesses. Steelix always runs Stealth Rock and Earthquake, while Gyro Ball, Roar, and Explosion fill the last two slots. Although Steelix usually invests in Special Defense to make the most of its resistances, an offensive set with Explosion and a type-resist Berry can bait in and eliminate either a Water- or a Fire-type Pokemon, depending on which Berry it holds.</dd>

<strong>Swellow</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Guts<br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 85 Atk / 60 Def / 50 SpA / 50 SpD / 125 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Swellow is the second fastest Pokemon in UU behind Electrode. Swellow is almost always seen as a Guts sweeper, and is thus quite predictable. Facade, Brave Bird, and U-turn make up the core of all Swellow sets, with the only question being whether it has Protect or Quick Attack in the last slot.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/470.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Tangrowth</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Chlorophyll / Leaf Guard<br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 100 Atk / 125 Def / 110 SpA / 50 SpD / 50 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Tangrowth, who is physically bulkier than Skarmory, makes a very effective physical wall. Defensive sets usually carry two of Power Whip, Leaf Storm, Hidden Power Ice, and Earthquake as attacks. Synthesis helps restore HP, while one of Sleep Powder, Leech Seed, Stun Spore, and Knock Off is chosen for the last slot. Tangrowth has base 100 Attack and base 110 Special Attack, so offensive sets are also a good choice, especially in the sun. Swords Dance sets use Power Whip, Earthquake, and Rock Slide, while mixed sets have Earthquake, Rock Slide, Hidden Power Fire, and either Power Whip or SolarBeam. Tangrowth's weak spot is its poor Special Defense, so any super effective special attack will likely OHKO it.</dd>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/128.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Tauros</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Intimidate / Anger Point<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 100 Atk / 95 Def / 40 SpA / 70 SpD / 110 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Tauros's high Speed and Attack stats make it a natural candidate to hold Choice Band or Life Orb. Due to Intimidate, Tauros can check physical threats in a pinch, even with an offensive set. Choice Band Tauros normally uses Return, Earthquake, Double-Edge, and either Payback or Stone Edge. Getting locked into a Normal- or Ground-type attack against one of the numerous Pokemon who resist these moves can be unsatisfying, so using Life Orb is another option. The Life Orb set can use the same moves as the Choice Band set; however, Stone Edge becomes a more attractive option due to the ability to switch moves.</dd>

<strong>Torterra</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Overgrow<br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 109 Atk / 105 Def / 75 SpA / 85 SpD / 56 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Torterra's main strengths are its excellent bulk and excellent Attack stat. It is commonly used as a sweeper or as a bulky tank. Sweeper sets all use Earthquake, Wood Hammer, and Stone Edge / Rock Slide. The fourth move is a set's defining move, and Torterra must choose from Rock Polish, Synthesis, and Substitute. The bulky tank often runs Synthesis and Stealth Rock along with Earthquake and either Seed Bomb or Wood Hammer; if there is another Stealth Rock user on Torterra's team, it can use Roar instead of Stealth Rock. Finally, Torterra can run a Leech Seed set with Earthquake, Wood Hammer, and Protect / Substitute. All of Torterra's defensive sets can use either physically or specially bulky spreads.</dd>

<strong>Toxicroak</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Dry Skin / Anticipation<br />
Base Stats: 83 HP / 106 Atk / 65 Def / 86 SpA / 65 SpD / 85 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Toxicroak has a unique ability in Dry Skin, which heals Toxicroak 25% HP when it is hit by a Water-type move. This gives Toxicroak many free turns, which it can use to set up with either Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, or Substitute. Swords Dance Toxicroak commonly runs Low Kick, Sucker Punch, and either Ice Punch, Poison Jab, or Stone Edge in the last slot. Nasty Plot Toxicroak usually runs both Sludge Bomb and Vacuum Wave and must choose between Dark Pulse (for coverage) and Focus Blast (for power) in the last slot. Finally, Toxicroak can also choose to use its free turn to set up a Substitute; this set normally uses Focus Punch, Sucker Punch, and Ice Punch or Stone Edge.</dd>

<strong>Typhlosion</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Blaze<br />
Base Stats: 78 HP / 84 Atk / 78 Def / 109 SpA / 85 SpD / 100 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Typhlosion is a dangerous special sweeper. Choice Scarf and Choice Specs Typhlosion both commonly run Eruption, Fire Blast, Hidden Power Grass, and Focus Blast. Non-Choice sets usually have Sunny Day, SolarBeam, Substitute, and Fire Blast, and aim to abuse Blaze, the SunnyBeam combination, and a Petaya or Salac Berry.</dd>

<strong>Ursaring</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Guts / Quick Feet<br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 130 Atk / 75 Def / 75 SpA / 75 SpD / 55 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Ursaring packs a massive Attack stat along with two very useful abilities. It almost always uses Swords Dance along with three moves, one of which is Facade or Return; it uses Facade with a status Orb and Return with Leftovers. The rest of its slots are filled with Crunch and either Earthquake or Close Combat. Guts gives a 50% boost to Ursaring's Attack, while Quick Feet gives a 50% boost to its Speed.</dd>

<strong>Uxie</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Levitate<br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 75 Atk / 130 Def / 75 SpA / 130 SpD / 95 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Uxie's outstanding bulk, great movepool, and passable offensive stats allow it to run a large array of sets. It's most commonly seen in the lead position with a moveset of Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, Psychic, and U-turn. However, the same lead set can be tweaked in many ways—it can utilize the infamous tactic of Choice Scarf + Trick, set up Sunny Day or Rain Dance, use Yawn + U-turn to garner advantageous switches, or execute the deadly dual screen + Memento setup combination. Outside of the lead position, Uxie can make good use of its respectable base Speed and acceptable Special Attack to attempt to sweep with a Calm Mind set, using Psychic, Thunderbolt / Grass Knot, and Hidden Power Ground as its attacks. Sometimes, Uxie drops one of the latter two attacks in favor of Substitute—or even both, to add Rest and Sleep Talk. It's important to note, however, that Mesprit has better offensive stats, meaning it pulls off a 3 attack set more efficiently in most cases.</dd>

<strong>Venusaur</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Overgrow<br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 82 Atk / 83 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 80 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Venusaur is one of the most unpredictable Pokemon in UU. It is about as common as a special sweeper as it is as a physical sweeper or as a specially defensive wall. The one thing that remains constant on all Venusaur sets is the presence of Sleep Powder. Synthesis is also quite common on Venusaur. The Life Orb special attacker often carries Sludge Bomb and Leaf Storm in addition to Synthesis and Sleep Powder, while the defensive set typically packs two of Sludge Bomb, Leaf Storm, Roar, and Leech Seed. The physical attacker usually runs Power Whip with either Earthquake and Return as attacking moves and may replace Synthesis with Swords Dance if more power is needed. Though less common than its other offensive sets, a mixed set with Sludge Bomb, Power Whip, Sleep Powder, and Synthesis works too.</dd>

<strong>Walrein</strong></p>
<p>Abilities: Thick Fat / Ice Body<br />
Base Stats: 110 HP / 80 Atk / 90 Def / 95 SpA / 90 SpD / 65 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Walrein is infamous for its stalling capabilities in hail. Walrein always runs Substitute and Protect so that it can recover HP while letting hail damage weaken the opponent. In the remaining two moveslots, Walrein uses a damaging attack—Surf or Brine, Blizzard, or Super Fang—along with a support option of either Toxic or Roar.</dd>
</dl>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/110.png" alt="" /><br />
<strong>Weezing</strong></p>
<p>Ability: Levitate<br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 90 Atk / 120 Def / 85 SpA / 70 SpD / 60 Spe</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Weezing boasts useful resistances to Fighting-, Ground-, Grass-, and Poison-type attacks. Physically defensive sets usually use Fire Blast / Sludge Bomb, Thunderbolt / Hidden Power Grass, Will-O-Wisp, and Pain Split, though sometimes you might see Haze in there. Weezing can also run a RestTalk set with Sludge Bomb and Will-O-Wisp. Rest + Sleep Talk gives it reliable recovery and makes it an effective sleep absorber, letting it switch into Venusaur more readily. Specially defensive Weezing almost always runs the aforementioned RestTalk set.</dd>
