<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the Pokemon's happiness, but lowers the Pokemon's HP EVs by 10. This Berry has no competitive use, but is very useful in-game. When EV training a Pokemon that already has HP EVs and you wish to remove the HP EVs, you can feed this Berry to that Pokemon to lower the HP EVs. This Berry can also correct a mistake in EV training; if you accidentally added HP EVs to a Pokemon that you did not wish to add them to, you can use the Pomeg Berry to remove the EVs. Natural Gift becomes a 70 Base Power Ice-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>
