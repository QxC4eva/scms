[Overview]

<p>With high Attack and a solid base 93 Speed, one would think that Unfezant would be a daunting attacker in the NU tier. However, it faces stiff competition from the likes of Swellow, Braviary, and even Dodrio, rendering this bird outclassed in most roles. However, Unfezant occupies an interesting niche in its access to Hypnosis and Taunt, as well as a great ability in Super Luck. While the pigeon's attacking movepool may be lacking options such as Brave Bird and Drill Peck, it has the right moves as a support Pokemon to earn itself a place on a team.<p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to use the unique qualities that only Unfezant possesses: the combination of Hypnosis, good support moves, a great ability, and high Speed. Even though Hypnosis has shaky accuracy, it will incapacitate an opponent's Pokemon when it does hit. Taunt is another trick that this pigeon has up its sleeve, allowing it to cripple walls and stop possible attempts to set up. Unfezant's Return does not hit as hard as some other birds' in the tier, but it does serve the purpose of saving Unfezant from becoming complete Taunt bait. Roost is for recovery, dramatically increasing Unfezant's lifespan and usefulness in battle.<p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Unfortunately, Unfezant suffers from four moveslot syndrome. A set like this would appreciate Toxic to provide some residual damage, but the moves listed are usually more important. Toxic contradicts the main reason to use Unfezant, Hypnosis. Unfezant has another STAB option in Pluck, but Berries are so rare that it is pointless to run it over Return. Wish, though an excellent support move, is illegal with Hypnosis and by far an inferior option on this Pokemon.<p>

[Other Options]

<p>Because of Unfezant's stats, a Choice Band set seems to be the most viable option. Unfortunately, such a set would be better off run on Swellow, Braviary, or Dodrio, as the three have access to Brave Bird. Unfezant also has access to Rain Dance and Sunny Day, aiding sweeps from Pokemon such as Gorebyss or Victreebel, respectively. Furthermore, Unfezant can use the somewhat gimmicky Tailwind, but it is very hard to utilize. A Wish set is not recommended because it would render Unfezant unable to use Hypnosis, which is by far the biggest incentive of using Unfezant.<p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As Unfezant is a support Pokemon, Taunt is always a large threat. Fortunately, due to Unfezant's high base Speed, it is surprisingly difficult to Taunt it. However, its weak defenses means that it is forced out by almost everything once Sleep Clause is activated. Although Unfezant is granted immunity from Toxic Spikes, Toxic severely hampers its performance. Unfezant's Flying typing also brings the wing-clipping weakness that is Stealth Rock, and the rarity of spinners in NU makes this problem worse.<p>
