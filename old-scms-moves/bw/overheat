<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and lowers the user's Special Attack by two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Overheat is an incredibly powerful Fire-type move. However, so much sheer power comes with a high price, as after usage it will sharply reduce the user's Special Attack, making them easy opportunities for enterprising opponents. For this reason, it fits a more hit-and-run playstyle often preferred by Choice users. Unfortunately, Fire-types have that nasty weakness to Stealth Rock and considering that Choice users have to switch out a lot by nature, it can prove troublesome. Anyhow, Choice Specs Heatran gets an honorable mention because it is bulky, hits hard, and is neutral to Stealth Rock, so is a very good candidate if you are using a technique of this sort.</p>
