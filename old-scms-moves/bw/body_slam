<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to paralyze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Though an excellent move, Body Slam faces some competition from Return and Frustration competitively, as they have a superior Base Power and distribution. Where Body Slam is used, it will be for its useful paralysis rate. Most notably, Serene Grace Pokemon such as Jirachi and Togekiss can use this move to spread paralysis in a somewhat reliable manner, without having to watch out for Taunt, Substitute, or Pokemon immune to Thunder Wave. This then allows them to flinch the opponent to death with Iron Head or Air Slash, respectively. Slower, more defensive Pokemon such as Snorlax may also choose to use this over Return or Frustration, as the higher damage output is likely to be less critical in a pinch than the chance for paralysis.</p>
