<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Recovers 50% of the user's max HP. Recover will fail if the user's HP is full, has 511 below max HP, 255 below max HP, or no HP.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Recover is one of the best moves in the game, and it, or its equivalent Softboiled, is almost mandatory for any defensive Pokemon and even some offensive ones. Alakazam and Starmie are the primary users of this move, walling special attacks, and even physical attacks with Reflect in the case of the first, recovering all damage received. Generally, if a Pokemon has access to Recover, it should be used.</p>
