Concept Assessment
[page]

<p>This thread will be set up shortly after the concept poll to allow the community time to best determine the path the concept should take. The discussion should remain general; poll-jumping is not allowed. The Topic Leader should propose a few general discussion questions based off of the concept to be used as starting points. The questions should be vague enough so that there is no set answer, but not so broad that the responses are completely scattered. Nothing specific should be decided in this thread, the point of the thread is just to gain some insight into the communityâ€™s opinion of the concept and find some sort of direction.</p>
