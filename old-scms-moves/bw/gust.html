<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Power doubles against Pokemon using Bounce, Fly, or Sky Drop.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Gust is the second weakest of all the Flying-type moves (only Peck has lower Base Power). Furthermore, Bounce and Fly aren't common enough to justify its use, and even if they were, it would still be too weak. Thus, it should never be considered as a option for any competitive battle.</p>
