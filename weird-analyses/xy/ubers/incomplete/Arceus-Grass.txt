Moves

========

    · Grass Knot for generally high powered stab considering the weight of most ubers, with more pp then judgment.
    Judgment for more consistent damage with stab.
    Recover for the obligatory recovery for longevity.
    Stone Edge for hitting the several flying types in the tier (read: Ho-Oh, Yveltal) that try to wall it.
    Earthquake to be able to deal some damage to mega-gengar, and steels that try to switch into it.
    Thunder Wave is used to prevent fast sweepers or trappers such as mega-gengar from taking advantage of grass arceus and can some in handy for other teammates who need the speed control.
    Will-o-Wisp deters physical attackers from switching in, like mega mewtwo X that are not deterred by arceus’ coverage.
    Defog to eliminate hazards and screens to support your team.

Set Details
========

    The EVs provide nice bulk, and allows sufficient damage with stone edge when needed. A hasty nature allows grassceus to outrun base 100s with the speed investment.

    What you choose depends on preference and team structure.
    An alternative ev spread if running earthquake would be 252 HP / 72 Atk / 72 Sdef 116 Spd with hasty nature
    Another alternate spread to be a backup check to xerneas would be 252 hp / 4 Spatk / 252 spd

Usage Tips

========

    This set’s moveslots are very interchangeable, and thus it can handle different threats with the right moves, so choose knowing what you want to cover.

    This set is a decent specs/scarf ogre check with smart prediction.
    Only use with earthquake if you have a really solid answer for ho-oh as even with earthquake, gengar isn't always losing.
    Avoid mega-gengar as much as you can, best case scenario you make a trade with it, but its still doing its job with destiny bond.

Team Options
========

    Water Types are good teammates, as they help deal with its fire weakness, and you can clear the way for their stab.
    A pursuit user like scizor helps mitigate the weakness to mega-gengar. Tyranitar also preforms this role, and also checks ho-oh, but is weak to focus blast so mega-gar can beat it.
    A rock or steel type to help deal with ho-oh and other flying types is nice, in the case of earthquake and even if you don't trust stone edge's accuracy.


Other Options
########

    Ice beam can be used over the edgequake moveslot, as it provides a way to hit the dragon types in the tier for decent damage.
    A calm mind set is possible consisting of recover, grass knot, calm mind and either fire blast or ice beam with 252 hp / 4 spatk / 252 speed, but it isn't very viable.
    Fire blast can fill the same role as ice beam and take over the edgequake moveslot.
