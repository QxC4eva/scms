<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>So in all of my time at Smogon, I still have not posted a Rate My Team. In a metagame where offensive teams are rampant and thriving, I wanted to attain a balance of both offense and defense, a team that could combat most opposing teams without resorting to either "heavy offense" or "heavy stall". This was definitely tougher than it sounds, considering I needed some typically offensive Pokemon to fill defensive niches on the team, resulting in a change of many standard movesets. </p>

<p>The team originally was crafted for the OU tier, with Vapereon over Manaphy. However, the true success of this team came on the suspect ladder, where the account "Twist O Fat" cruised to an almost 1700 CRE and a 1905 rating (for all you number whores). In the upcoming team analysis, I will show how Manaphy as well as my other team members handled the majority of threats in the metagame, and why this team was so successful.</p>

<p>If you look at the team at a glance, I am sure you will find very common weaknesses. These will be covered in the threat list, and I will do my best to list the ways I deal with these problems. Nonetheless, I've played around a majority of Pokemon during the Manaphy suspect test, including Manaphy itself, and the team's performance backs up my somewhat unorthodox team.</p>

<p>As a side note, I use Manaphy in a completely different manner than the majority of suspect players, so if you want to find out, keep reading!</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/410.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Roserade</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Toxic Spikes<br />
- Leaf Storm<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Hidden Power Ground</p>

<p>Roserade is in my opinion the best lead in the metagame. With the amount of Metagross and Heatran leads, I find Roserade the perfect lead to both cripple opposing leads with Sleep Powder, set up Toxic Spikes early game to aid my offensive mons, and hit hard with the combination of Leaf Storm and Hidden Power Ground.</p>

<p>The EV's are quite basic; maximize speed to get the jump on some lax base 100s, and max special attack to hit as hard with Leaf Storm / Hidden Power Ground</p>

<p>Hidden Power Ground may seem like a ridiculous option, but it lets me get the jump on those common lead Heatrans and Metagrosses, who for some reason love to stay in on Roserade. The combination of Sleep Powder and Hidden Power Ground usually removes Heatran's Shuca Berry, forcing them to switch and allowing me to get an early layer up.</p>

<p>This lead plays in no way like a suicide lead. I do not play recklessly and simply sacrifice Roserade in order to get two layers of Toxic Spikes out. As you will soon see, Roserade is my most common way of dealing with Suicune and on the suspect ladder, Manaphy. The sash is what really saves my ass on multiple occasions, though I may get some criticism for using it in conjuction with Tyranitar. I'll get to that soon.</p>

<p><strong>Skarmory</strong> @ Shed Shell<br />
Ability: Keen Eye<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 200 Def / 36 SpD / 20 Spe<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Whirlwind<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Roost<br />
- Brave Bird</p>

<p>Skarmory provides the second form of residual damage, in the form of Spikes and Whirlwind. On typical stall teams, Skarmory is usually used in conjunction with other physical walls to remove strain on Skarmory. Unfortunately, with the nature of this team, I rely on Skarmory a little bit too much. Countering threats like Scizor and physical Jirachi is really important for this team to function; however, I also rely on Skarmory to beat stuff like Tyranitar and sometimes Lucario. Not the smartest option I know, but I do have ways of revenge-killing.</p>

<p>The EV spread was ripped right from Obi's infamous stall team. Max HP allows for Skarmory to take many, and the remaining EV's are primarily placed in defense to take the most physical hits possible. The 20 Speed EV's are the only change from Obi's spread, so that I get the jump on opposing Skarmory and almost always outspeed Tyranitar trying to Stone Edge for the 2HKO. Shed Shell is obvious because of stupid Magnezone.</p>

<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 40 Atk / 216 SpD<br />
Sassy Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Crunch</p>

<p>Special defensive Tyranitar without the Choice Band, and Stealth Rock over Pursuit to complete the entry hazards that this team relies on. Flamethrower is for all those incoming Scizors, and even Skarmory who apparently like to come in on Tyranitar. Although not so common on stall teams, Tyranitar is the perfect fit for this style of team, providing a strong offense with very underrated defensive capabilities. Tyranitar holds the team together, taking out special attackers such as Jolteon, Rotom, Azelf, etc. I usually don't mind Rotom's Will-O-Wisp because of Heatran, so I somewhat recklessly play Tyranitar to open holes for my last three members to wreck havok. </p>

<p>Along with those offensive threats, Tyranitar acts as my way to defeat things like Cresselia, Zapdos, and annoying ghosts. Tyranitar also tends to be my first Blissey switch-in, allowing for an easy setup of Stealth Rock. With the very specially defensive EV Spread, Tyranitar also serves as the Latias check on the standard ladder. Essentially, Tyranitar covers the holes that heavy stall teams usually have (last Pokemon Calm Mind sweepers, for example).</p>

<p>Oh, so I'm sure some people will state the counterproductivity of Focus Sash and Sandstorm. I usually save Tyranitar as late as possible, or make sure Roserade has enough survivability in order to ignore the 6% loss in health each turn. Usually, Roserade and Sandstorm doesn't conflict in terms of the overall team goal, so I'd rather keep it.</p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Toxic</p>

<p>Heatran takes all the fire attacks aimed at Roserade and Skarmory, and turns the Flash Fire boost into a devastating offensive onslaught. With Toxic Spikes support, Blissey cannot stand up to the combination of Substitute and Fire Blast. Earth Power is for other Heatran (which I only attack under a Substitute) and Tyranitar. Toxic is for bulky waters such as Gyarados that avoid Toxic Spikes, and even things like Zapdos that can be extremely annoying (especially SubRoost varients). </p>

<p>Heatran is another one of those Pokemon that represents a good balance of offensive and defensive capabilities. With the potential to take unboosted special attacks (bar Ground attacks and some Fighting attacks), Heatran also acts as a somewhat secondary counter to things like Azelf and possibly Gengar (as you will see in the threat list, Gengar is the single biggest issue this team has). Because of its Steel typing, I usually end up switching this into Draco Meteors at times, and possibly Outrages depending on if Skarmory is still alive or dead. </p>

<p><strong>Gengar</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>Ahh Gengar....wait used as a spin blocker, are you insane ToF??? Well, I find that the element of surprise can be quite handy in breaking down an opponents team. Gengar is the glue of the team. Its multiple resistances allow me to easily switch it in, and I don't fear those common Pursuiters because of Focus Blast and Hidden Power Fire. I usually have entry hazards up as well so Tyranitar doesn't stand a chance at surviving. Most Scizors predict my switch-out and Pursuit, only to get nailed by a Hidden Power Fire. If I can tell that Scizor is Bullet Punching, I can go to Skarmory and Roost off the damage or Heatran and sit pretty behind a Substitute. </p>

<p>Hidden Power Fire also has the additional benefit of beating Forretress, who is becoming more and more special defensive to in fact beat Gengar on heavy-stall teams. They won't get the chance to Payback, and meet a suprise death. Stuff like Donphan and Starmie also get hit relatively hard by Shadow Ball, so Gengar actually makes a very potent spin blocker.</p>

<p>The rest of the moves are all for the optimal coverage. Shadow Ball to hit Infernape hard, and Thunderbolt to hit Manaphy super-effectively, as well as random bulky waters like Suicune and Vaporeon. The EV spread is as basic as many of the rest of my team members; maximize speed and special attack to hit hardest and most effectively. </p>

<p>And finally...the unorthodox use of Manaphy!</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/495.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Manaphy</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Hydration<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Surf<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Hidden Power Electric<br />
- Rest</p>

<p>So a defensive Manaphy that is an inferior Suicune huh? One again, the element of surprise is quite effective in beating the common threats of the metagame. At a quick glance, DD Gyarados runs through my current team. So, lets try HP Electric Manaphy shall we? I usually end up switching Manaphy in while Gyarados DD's. The opponent, expecting no threat from Manaphy, usually DD's again. To his/her dismay, Manaphy HP Electrics Gyarados for the KO quite easily, also leaving me at full health. As simple as it sounds, this is often the case haha.</p>

<p>Manaphy also is my DDMence check, being able to take a +1 Life Orb Outrage with 20% or so left. Often, Gyarados comes in after DDMence takes a chunk of Manaphy's life, and tries to Dragon Dance, letting me take out two Pokemon easily. I'd actually not trade Manaphy for something like Suicune in this spot for the sheer unpredictability, though after this rate my team I might have to consider it =).</p>
