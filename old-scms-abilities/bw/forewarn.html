[SHORT DESC]
Tells which of the opponent's moves has the highest Base Power. 

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Alerts the wielder to the opponent's move that has the highest Base Power when the user switches in. If two moves are of the same Base Power, Forewarn randomly selects one. In doubles, Forewarn will only reveal one move total, not one move from each opponent. It selects the highest power move from the two opponents. Forewarn will immediately activate whenever the ability is acquired, such as through <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>. All moves without a Base Power are assigned a power, according to the list below.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Forewarn is a useful scouting tool, albeit a bit gimmicky and unreliable, but most Pokemon that receive it have a better ability option. <a href="/bw/pokemon/hypno">Hypno</a> receives <a href="/bw/abilities/insomnia">Insomnia</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/jynx">Jynx</a> has <a href="/bw/abilities/dry_skin">Dry Skin</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/musharna">Musharna</a> can use either <a href="/bw/abilities/synchronize">Synchronize</a> in singles or <a href="/bw/abilities/telepathy">Telepathy</a> in doubles. Opt for one of those options over Forewarn and you'll usually find yourself with a greater deal of success.</p>
