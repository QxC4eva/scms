<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Speed by two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While solely Speed-boosting moves are not perhaps so frequently made use of by boosting sweepers as moves that raise Attack or Special Attack, or some combination of Speed and offensive stats, that is not to say that it is necessarily a bad choice. The principle difficulty when using a move like Agility are that, while you significantly reduce the user's chances of being outsped, this relies almost entirely upon the user having sufficient power to bulldoze its way through the foe's team unboosted. In addition, for the sake of coverage as well as practicality issues, an offensive boosting move more often than not cannot be put on the set either, and Agility does not stop priority moves from ruining your fun either, which is a big problem since many Agility users are not only fast regardless, so have little need of the boost, but also frail, so can be taken down before they can get started by Conkeldurr or Scizor. Exceptions to this general rule include Metagross and Dragonite, who are both bulky, extremely powerful, and also slow enough to need the boost in order to sweep. However, even they use the move very rarely.</p>
