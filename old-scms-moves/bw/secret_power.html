<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Secret Power has little competitive use. The chance to lower accuracy is also not a big draw, since doing so is an unreliable tactic. The only slightly viable users of the move would be Normal-types, due to the fact hey receive STAB damage on it. However, as far as most of them are concerned, they definitely has better things that it could be doing with the moveslot.</p>
