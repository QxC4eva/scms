[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and traps the opponent for 4-5 turns, dealing 1/16 of the target's maximum health at the end of each of those turns and preventing the target from switching. If the user is holding a Grip Claw, it traps the opponent for 5 turns all the time. If a trapped Pokemon uses Rapid Spin, it will be freed. If the user is holding a Binding Band, the damage dealt at the end of each turn increases to 1/8 of the target's maximum health. The target can still switch out if it is holding Shed Shell or uses Baton Pass, U-turn, or Volt Switch. This effect is not stackable or reset by using this or another partial-trapping move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Whirlpool is an incredibly gimmicky move. It can be used to trap harmless foes and allow some Pokemon to set up. Some users of Whirlpool such as Manaphy and Cloyster can trap a Pokemon with Whirlpool and set up with Tail Glow and Shell Smash, respectively. However, deciding to run Whirlpool limits the coverage options of the user which can be costly as it might not be able to defeat some Pokemon it would otherwise be able to.</p>
