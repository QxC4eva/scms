Overview
########
- Gliscor faces competition from other Ground-types like Landorus-T and Groudon but it has key niches in Poison Heal and Taunt
- Although the old Substitute set isn't very effective anymore in the XY metagame, Gliscor has adapted to find a new niche as a reliable Stealth Rock setter

Stealth Rock
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Poison Heal
item: Toxic Orb
nature: Impish
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD

Moves
========

- Stealth Rock is an important hazard for all teams and Gliscor is a reliable setter for it
- Taunt is one of the main things to seperate Gliscor from other Ground-types and is useful for stopping Defog, Spikes, and Rest among other things
- Toxic cripples support Arceus formes making it even harder for them to Defog. It is also Gliscor's main method of dealing damage
- Earthquake is a STAB move that hits decently hard and complements well with Toxic by hitting Poison-types and Steel-types for supereffective damage
- Knock Off can be used to pester switch-ins by robbing them of their items
- Roost is an option to give Gliscor even more recovery but it doesn't really need it and doesn't have much room for it

Set Details
========

- Maximum physical bulk to better check the things Gliscor is meant to like Zekrom and Groudon
- Gliscor has a very nice speed tier so investing in it to have a faster Taunt is an option
- Toxic Orb activates Poison Heal

Usage Tips
========

- Use Gliscor's bulk to setup Stealth Rock and spread status
- Defensive teams are annoyed by the status immunity and Taunt so take advantage of that
- Gliscor's Toxic Orb doesn't activate until the end of the turn it is brought out so make sure to not let it get burned or paralyzed before that happens

Team Options
========

- Kyogre is bothersome so a nice water resist like Palkia works well with Gliscor
- A Fairy-type pairs well with Gliscor as it forces opposing Zekrom's to coin flip between choosing a STAB move as there's an immunity to both
- Spikes setters like Klefki pair well with Gliscor as it can Taunt Defog users as they switch in and force them to take hazards damage without getting the chance to even temporarily clear them
- Kyogre's rain helps Gliscor check Blaziken better
- Gliscor is effective on Stick Webs teams as it has a nice speed, checks Landorus-T, sets up Stealth Rock, and can Taunt Defog users


Other Options
########

- Defog is a nice move for clearing hazards but it can't be used with Poison Heal Gliscor since Gliscor could only learn it in generation 4

Checks & Counters
########

**Gengar**: A Gengar that doesn't Mega Evolve maintains Levitate allowing it to switch into Gliscor as often as it likes. If it runs Icy Wind or Shadow Ball it can also trap and KO Gliscor.
**Kyogre**: Defensive Kyogre can take advantage of its investment in bulk to switch in repeatedly on Gliscor and force it out with the threat of Scald. Rest can heal off Toxic and residual damage and, thanks to the new sleep mechanics, not even Taunt can shut it down. It still, however, has to be wary of blindly switching into a Taunt over and over when it is already Toxic poisoned. Offensive Kyogre variants like Choice Specs don't really like switching into Gliscor much but once it is in, it can threaten the team with a powerful Water Spout.
**Xerneas**: Defensive Xerneas will take a pittance from Earthquake while Rest will resolve any Toxic issues. Moonblast, on the other hand, will hit Gliscor for a large amount of damage. Xerneas even has a higher base speed to possibly get a Rest or Sleep Talk in before Taunt. 
**Water Arceus**: Water Arceus takes very little from Earthquake while Judgment will easily KO Gliscor. Refresh Water Arceus isn't even bothered by Toxic and can attempt to boost with Calm Mind while Gliscor switches out.
**Dark Arceus**: Refresh Calm Mind Dark Arceus doesn't fear anything Gliscor throws at it and can threaten a Calm Mind sweep late-game.
**Steel Arceus**: Immune to Toxic while Earthquake isn't strong enough to overpower Arceus's Recover. Judgment hits back hard and Steel Arceus can go for a Calm Mind sweep in the late game.
**Poison Arceus**: Immune to Toxic and, despite it being supereffective, Earthquake does not do enough damage to prevent Poison Arceus from Recovering off the damage. Gliscor does resist it's STAB attack but its low special defense lets it down. 
**Bronzong**: Immune to both Earthquake and Toxic although it can't really do much back especially with Gyro Ball's low PP.
**Charizard**: Mega Charizard Y is immune to Earthquake and isn't really intended to last a long time so Toxic is hardly a concern. Stealth Rock is bothersome but Gliscor is likely the one setting Stealth Rock making things more complicated.
**Yveltal**: Immune to Earthquake and Taunt stops Toxic. Stealth Rock is bothersome but Oblivion Wing helps with that passive damage. Still doesn't like switching into Toxic but Oblivion Wing helps with that passive damage in the short term.
