<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Finally, we have come to the conclusion of the OU suspect  test coverage   series. With Genesect and Tornadus-T gone, we turn our  heads to the  last  broken Pokemon left, Deoxys-D. This time,  we will be reviewing  Round 10  while also covering an additional  subject of defining a  suspect, and  what makes a Pokemon broken. Just  like all previous  installments of this  series, we will be covering the teams used in this  round, what the  community's opinions were on the test, and how it  affected the current  metagame. This time, we will be covering the 10th  round of suspect  testing, the most recently conducted test.</p>

<h2>Suspect Round 10</h2>

<p>The last space alien in the metagame is a fearsome and bulky one at   that. But this one is not meant for stalling; its primary use is to lay   down hazards and support hyper offensive teams by providing fast   momentum. Being virtually impossible to OHKO without great effort,   Deoxys-D almost guarantees Stealth Rock on the field every time  while   potentially preventing the opponent from getting hazards up.  Only a  fast  Taunt could stop Deoxys-D from getting hazards up, but even  then  Magic  Coat or Mental Herb could reflect back its effects or allow  Deoxys-D to simply  ignore Taunt, allowing it to proceed in laying down   hazards. Deoxys-D  was mostly hated by the community especially because   of its rather skill-less attributes. Deoxys-D, in one word, was:  annoying.  It could survive virtually anything and lay down hazards to  support  its team, meaning the opponent had an  abysmal chance of  winning the  initial lead match-up. While some loved  the fact that  Deoxys-D could lay  down hazards and provide quick team  support, others  thought it was a  broken and easily-used aspect which made the game  uncompetitive. Many  can vouch for how effective Deoxys-D was, and the  fact that it has a  relatively wide support movepool made it even more  powerful.  This defensive giant didn't really have a place on most   stall, but on  offensive teams it had a perfect lead position to easily   gain uncounterable momentum, and it was clear this was becoming more   and more a problem as hyper-offense's popularity grew to new heights.</p>

<p>Deoxys-D was the last of its kind, being the only forme available for  use  in Overused. It was at first neglected to the Underused metagame,  but  was quickly exploited and banned to OU, freeing UU from  hyper-offense's  grasp. However, with the recognition of  Deoxys-D in  UU, it was easy to  see that soon it would become popular in  the  standard metagame.  Hyper-offense became the premier laddering style  in  no time. With  mostwanted creating the first real popular   hyper-offense team, the race  to ladder with the new style was on.   Deoxys-D was a choice that many  players added, and many high-ranked    players used very similar offensive teams designed to win and climb the    ladder quickly. It was easy to see this was becoming almost an   epidemic,  but luckily the style died down a bit over time. It became   predictable,  as most teams were built up of the same Pokemon. It was   still a popular  style as many people innovated with it and created new   builds and  strategies, but one thing stayed the same&mdash;the   ringleader was almost always Deoxys-D. It could set down hazards    quickly or prevent them at all costs, and then, if proper hazard support    was up, the game would almost immediately be over due to the  early-game  momentum gained by Deoxys-D's team. As we all know, Deoxys-D  had remained relatively untouched in  suspect testing until recently;  after all the main problems were dealt with,  it was finally time to  solve the problem of Deoxys-D. Some thought it  was easily countered,  only served one purpose, and could easily  fail, while others thought it  almost guaranteed hazards  being laid down on the opponent's side.  It  just made the game too easy to win, and it was  something that was  just  skill-less to use. It required little-to-no  prediction at all, and   Deoxys-D was almost impossible to stop once it  got the ball rolling;  due to its bulk, it was incredibly hard to  1-shot it early in the game.  Even in the  Genesect era, it could not be  stopped due to the typical  altering in  the EV spread preventing a  Special Attack Download boost.  It was time  to put this monster to the  test, and if banned, it could  end the craze of hyper-offense once and for  all, or at least the type  of team that was being used since the start  of the BW metagame.</p>

<p>On February 4th, the thread went up, and it was fairly straightforward   in its purpose: discussing whether Deoxys-D was to be kept in OU or not.  The testing began and the ladder  was opened. The suspect ladder did  not include Deoxys-D, so more  straightforward conventional  offense was  used. The ladder was similar  to the actual standard one,  but with a  few exceptions. The typical  laddering Pokemon were placed much  higher&mdash;Keldeo touched an exceptional high at #1, with   Tyranitar being the #1 weather inducer at #5 in usage  statistics. The   ladder was nothing too special, but it did show that  stall, which was  seen quite a lot more than previous rounds, was flourishing and doing a  lot better without Deoxys-D in the  metagame.  It was  simply more  viable and was thus used to much greater success.  Unlike  other  suspects, however, Deoxys-D was not extremely high in usage statistics.   For the most part, it loomed around the #20+ range for most previous   rounds and months in both suspect ladders and standard OU. Deoxys-D was  thus a  very special case, as unlike Genesect, Keldeo, and Tornadus-T,   it was  not very high in the usage statistics. Nonetheless, the   community felt  it was a broken aspect of the metagame, and because of   that it was  rightfully tested. The thread, on the other hand, had the   usual amount of discussion that was involved with suspect tests. For the  most  part, it was either  "Deoxys-D is completely broken and needs to  be  banned" or "Deoxys-D  is easily countered and does not need to be  banned." For some, Sableye,  Scizor, and fast Taunt users were ample  counters to Deoxys-D, along with hard hitters like Choice Band  Tyranitar. To others,  Deoxys-D  was almost impossible to be killed  without it getting at  least 1 hazard  down, and it was a cancer to the  metagame. The community  was split, and  so were the upcoming results of  the test which would  determine the fate  of Deoxys-D. No side was  heavily leaned to, and it  was not a big  surprise as most of the  community found value in its quick and powerful  playstyle.</p>

<p>The test finally ended, and the results went live. Deoxys-D was banned    on a margin of 59.34%, not a landslide by any means. While some may  have   been disappointed due to the death of their favorite playstyle,  it was  clear to see more people wanted it gone. Deoxys-D was  banned  once and for all, and now there was nobody left to complain about  it.  Hyper-offense  is not gone by any means however, and it still is  alive  today. But the  old typical Deoxys-D hyper offense form is now long   gone.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>That was most likely the  last suspect test for the generation. Until  next generation, or at least possibly  till next generation, we will  have to wait for the next suspect testing round.  This will bring a  whole new slate of content, and hopefully new   excitement to the  metagame as we have no idea what the new generation   will bring. But  for Generation 5 OU suspect testing, this is where it   cuts off, at  least for now. It's not a long wait until the next   generation rolls  in, so expect fresh suspect testing coverage very  soon. Additionally,  just  because the individual suspect round coverage is finished  does  not  mean the suspect process is finished for the generation. We  still  have  roughly 5 months left of Gen V, so expect more suspect  content as  the generation progresses into its final months!</p>
