[Overview]

<p>Solrock, an exceptionally odd-looking Pokemon sporting an unusual typing, has rather unattractive base stats; its best stat is its base 95 Attack stat, which even in NU is mediocre without a boost. It's cursed with bad Speed, and doesn't have the defenses to compensate for it, making it only usable under Trick Room. It can also Baton Pass Rock Polish boosts, although it faces direct competition from Ninjask in this role. All in all, Solrock is not a great Pokemon by any means, but it has a small niche in NU to make it stand out.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The main goal of this set is for Solrock to set up Trick Room and possibly Stealth Rock, and then switch out. However, Solrock can accomplish more if you so desire. Stone Edge and Earthquake provide amazing neutral coverage, and allow Solrock to take advantage of the Trick Room that is set up. However, Zen Headbutt is a fine option that gains a STAB boost and hits the multitude of Fighting- and Poison-types in NU, such as Sawk, Gurdurr, and Vileplume, a lot harder. Explosion is another fine option to hit an opponent hard, and lets you bring in a teammate for free to take advantage of Trick Room. It should be used over Stealth Rock if you don't intend to lead with Solrock or you have another Stealth Rock user.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread gives Solrock maximum power as well as a good amount of bulk, while a Brave nature and 0 Speed IV allow it to function more effectively under Trick Room. Focus Sash is the preferred item for a dedicated lead Solrock, but Leftovers has more general use, and gives increased longevity if Solrock doesn't function as your team's lead.</p>

<p>Slow Pokemon that flourish under the effects of Trick Room are fantastic partners for Solrock, as they can make use of the support that it brings. Good examples of these Pokemon include Exeggutor, Musharna, Gigalith, and Gurdurr, and the latter synergizes well with Solrock. Alas, Solrock is completely ruined by Taunt, so ways around Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Skuntank, and Hypno are recommended. A hard-hitting attacker that requires no setup is good for dealing with them, such as Charizard.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>At first glance, it might seem that Solrock has nothing over other users of Rock Polish such as Camerupt, but all that changes with Solrock's access to Baton Pass. Although it faces direct competition from Ninjask as a passer of Speed boosts, Solrock sports better bulk and far superior coverage. This specific set boasts the ability to lure out and escape from its counters, avoiding Pursuit from the like of Skuntank. Stone Edge provides Solrock with a way of using the boost itself, and is a powerful STAB move, although Rock Slide provides more accuracy at the cost of significant power. Earthquake rounds out the set, providing crucial coverage to beat foes such as Skuntank, Muk, and Probopass.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>228 Speed EVs allow Solrock to outrun all of unboosted NU after a single Rock Polish, including Ninjask, and outpace max Speed Torterra before a Rock Polish. The remaining EVs aim to increase Solrock's bulk as much as possible to ensure that it gets the Baton Pass off. Leftovers contributes to Solrock's overall longevity, and can help it pass Substitutes to a teammate, if that floats your boat. However, Solrock must give up significant coverage if it chooses to do so. Likewise, Solrock can also Baton Pass Iron Defense boosts, which is perfect for a Pokemon such as Charizard, which has decent special bulk to compliment the boost.</p>

<p>Good teammates for this set are those that can take advantage of a Rock Polish boost. Samurott is a great choice, because although it is by no means slow, it sometimes lacks the Speed to defeat offensive teams. Torkoal synergizes well with Solrock as it resists Grass-type moves that Solrock will fall to, and Solrock returns the favor by being immune to Ground-type attacks. Exeggutor is also a good candidate for Rock Polish boosts, although it shares a few weaknesses with Solrock. This set is somewhat more difficult to Taunt due to the increase in Speed, so Solrock can escape from Skuntank before it uses Taunt.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Solrock has a wide array of support options that it can make use of. It can set up dual screens, but is outclassed in this by Serperior, which has an arguably better typing, higher Speed, and greater bulk. Explosion is not as powerful as it was back in DPP, but it is still usable. Will-O-Wisp can be an option to cripple physical attackers and instead invest in Special Defense, but it's generally not worth giving up a moveslot for. Solrock can also use Baton Pass to pass both Calm Mind and Cosmic Power boosts, but at that point you should be using Lunatone instead, as it can make better use of the boosts before they get to the intended receiver. Gravity is a niche move that gives Stone Edge perfect accuracy, but it replaces Solrock's Ground immunity with a weakness, and it is generally gimmicky. A Choice Band set could see some use, but Solrock is neither fast enough nor strong enough to pull it off feasibly.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Solrock has plenty of counters, as it is not particularly threatening. Alomomola sponges all of Solrock's attacks, and brings it to its death with Waterfall. Exeggutor is able to come in on a Trick Room, outspeed, and KO with its STAB Grass-type moves. Speedy Pokemon that utilize U-turn, such as Swellow and Braviary, are a thorn in Solrock's side, as Solrock is weak to Bug, and faster users of U-turn can't be hit. Skuntank outspeeds Solrock as well, and can use Taunt to disrupt its setup, use Sucker Punch as it tries to attack with Earthquake, or use Pursuit as it tries to flee, hitting it for massive damage. Misdreavus is also a good answer to Solrock: aside from boasting Taunt, it can use Will-O-Wisp to limit Solrock's offensive potential, or hit it hard with STAB Shadow Ball.</p>

<p>Baton Pass sets are slightly harder to counter, as Solrock becomes ridiculously fast after a Rock Polish. However, Choice Scarf Braviary still outspeeds it after a Rock Polish, and can severely damage Solrock with U-turn while avoiding a Stone Edge or Rock Slide. +1 Ninjask can outspeed Solrock as well, and will do a good amount of damage with X-Scissor before succumbing to either Stone Edge or Rock Slide.</p>
