<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/478.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Mamoswine</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Snow Cloak<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Shard<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Endeavor</p>

<p>I have to admit that, at first, this was merely used in order to take down the popular ShucaTran lead set, and it was extremely effective at doing just that. Earthquake OHKOes 4 HP Heatran all the time. Stealth Rock is relatively easy to set up due to Mamoswine's ability to force switches. Normally, the opponent will switch in Scizor. I can use Endeavor on the following turn (when Scizor uses Bullet Punch), knocking Scizor down to 1 HP. Ice Shard then picks off any remaining HP. Earthquake is useful for taking down opposing Metagross and deals decent damage to anything not immune to it. Ice Shard is particularly helpful against lead Azelf and Aerodactyl. Endeavor + Ice Shard, surprisingly, takes down the popular Double Screen -> Gliscor -> Metagross strategy by bypassing the screens and Gliscor's Yache Berry. Or I can survive the attack from Metagross, Endeavor on that turn, and Ice Shard for the KO the next.</p>

<p><strong>Scizor</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Technician<br />
EVs: 240 HP / 56 Atk / 212 SpD<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- Superpower</p>

<p>Scizor is the best answer to Latios that I have found. With the given EVs, Scizor is capable of switching in and taking Stealth Rock / Draco Meteor / -2 Surf without dying. If Latios does not switch, Pursuit deals 75.08% - 88.37% damage. However, if Latios attempts to flee, Pursuit will deal 99.67% - 117.61%, a essentially definite OHKO. U-turn is extremely useful for scouting and allows me to play off the team's numerous immunities and resistances while dealing respectable damage due to STAB. Bullet Punch still deals 56.15% - 66.11% to min/min Latios, meaning even with the sharp drop in power due to the bulky EVs, it still retains the ability to 2HKO. Because of the bulky EVs, Scizor also makes a good switch-in against Starmie.</p>

<p><strong>Kingdra</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Swift Swim<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Waterfall</p>

<p>Kingdra forms the first half of the team's "double-dragon" strategy, by eliminating many of Latios' counters such as Blissey, Metagross, and Jirachi. Due to Kingdra's bulk, it is capable of setting up on Suicune, Vaporeon, and other bulky Water-types. It also makes a fantastic switch-in to Pokemon locked into Fire or Water-type attacks (meaning, it makes a good switch-in to Heatran). With max Speed, Kingdra outspeeds all Pokemon with base 130 Speed or lower. With the large number of Dragons in the metagame, Kingdra is more than capable of sweeping by itself. With Stealth Rock damage and +2 Attack, Kingdra OHKOs max / max Blissey and offensive Suicune one hundred percent of the time. +1 Outrage deals 56.92% - 67.19%% to standard (188 HP / 252 Def [Bold]) Vaporeon, a definite 2HKO. With Lum Berry, Kingdra can more easily switch in against Blissey.</p>

<p><strong>Latios</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Surf<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Roost</p>

<p>The current suspect is one of the most threatening Pokemon in the game, although it isn't unstoppable. This set attempts to deal the most damage possible. Draco Meteor deals massive damage to everything and even has a 34% chance of 2HKOing min HP Heatran if it switches into Stealth Rock (not that you would use Draco Meteor instead of Surf the second time; just showing that it hurts a lot). Surf really hurts Tyranitar and Heatran and when paired with Draco Meteor, it offers extreme neutral coverage. Surf 2HKOes offensive Scizor and Metagross. Thunderbolt deals 69.20% - 81.70% to standard Vaporeon and similar damage to Suicune. Thunderbolt also quickly finishes off Gyarados while providing me with a quick way to dispose of weakened Salamence without resorting to the Special Attack lowering Draco Meteor. Latios, along with Kingdra, are my main switch-ins to Infernape. Life Orb max SpA HP Ice from Infernape only manages to deal 52.49% - 61.79% to Latios, meaning it can switch in on Close Combat or Flamethrower / Fire Blast and KO Infernape, and then Roost away the damage.</p>

<p><strong>Metagross</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 112 Atk / 136 Def / 8 Spe<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Meteor Mash<br />
- Reflect</p>

<p>Metagross is my main answer to offensive threats such as Scizor and Tyranitar due to its extremely high Defense and access to Reflect. I usually switch in against Gyarados if it is proving to be troublesome and explode, instantly eliminating any problem. Explosion is also useful for its ability to quickly end n-1 situations. With Earthquake, Metagross is my first switch-in against lead Jirachi. Meteor Mash helps eliminate Latios and deals a bunch of damage to Flygon if it switches in predicting Earthquake. Because my team doesn't really have a "true" answer to Machamp, I tend to Explode on it upon first sight. Reflect helps against Lucario and Scizor who like to try to set up and kill me. n_n. With Reflect up, +2 Kingdra only manages 23% with Waterfall at most, so Metagross does a good job of countering that too!</p>

<p><strong>Jolteon</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Volt Absorb<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Charge Beam<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Hidden Power Grass<br />
- Shadow Ball</p>

<p>Jolteon helps check a lot of threats in the current metagame including Latios, Salamence, Rotom-A, and various others. Usually, I'm able to U-Turn from Scizor out of one of these threats and respond accordingly. +1 Thunderbolt can 2HKO less defensive versions of Magnezone while Charge Beam + Shadow Ball makes quick work of Rotom-A. Jolteon's high Speed allows it to more efficiently sweep. Although, Jolteon is reliant on Scizor's ability to trap and kill Blissey. Hidden Power [Grass] KOes Swampert and Rhyperior and Thunderbolt OHKOes Salamence after Stealth Rock so I don't need HP Ice.</p>
