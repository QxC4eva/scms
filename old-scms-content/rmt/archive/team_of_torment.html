<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>So now that Team US West’s run in the World Cup has come to an end, I have decided to post my very first ever RMT. Though this team has no laddering accomplishments or anything to prove its effectiveness (I purposefully did not ladder with this team, so that my sets would not spread while the World Cup was going on), I’m sure it’s many victims can attest to how terrifying it is to face this team. So without any further ado, I present to you Team of Torment:</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/248.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong> @ Lum Berry<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 126 Atk / 120 SpD / 12 Spe<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Rest<br />
- Pursuit</p>

<p>Ah yes, this Tyranitar starts things off nicely. EV’d to do 95% min to standard lead Roserades with Stone Edge, allowing him to take the Sleep Powder (thanks to Lum), do at least 95% back, then let Sand Stream finish it off, rendering the focus sash useless. Then 12 Speed EV’s is to outrun random other TTars that only put 4 or 8 speed on. These EVs were more important back when I ran SuperPower over Rest. However, I decided Rest was overall more useful on this guy, because if I do not face a sleep-inducing lead, then I can give myself greater longevity by resting later for some instant recovery. I prefer Pursuit on this over Crunch, just because I like guaranteeing that Latias or Rotom won’t be coming in again. That also explains why I have so much SDef bulk; so I can switch in on those two with ease. This lead only loses to Metagross and Infernape leads, and is one of my favorite new toys.</p>

<p><strong>Latias</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 180 HP / 60 Def / 16 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Roar<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Recover<br />
- Calm Mind</p>

<p>I saw this set posted on Panamaxis’s RMT, and knew instantly that I had to try it out. I fixed the EV’s though, to my linking. I run max speed, so that I can revenge kill other Latiases and Gengars who have HP Fire (otherwise my Forretress can take care of them). Then I have enough bulk to comfortably live a +2 Orb ES from Lucatio, which also allows me to survive Pursuits from CB Scizor and TTar, while Roaring them away. This set also allows me to completely destroy all other CM Pokemon, by setting up with them, then Roaring them out. A great set that has saved my ass on multiple occations.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-H</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 38 HP / 252 SpA / 220 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting<br />
- Trick</p>

<p>Scarf Rotom is so valuable to this team. Enough speed to outspeed Jolly Gyarados’s (thought I sometimes run max speed, to guarantee a speed tie vs. other scarf Rotoms, and outspeed Jolly +1 Kingdra, even though that is rarely used). This thing can revenge kill a lot of threats to my team, including Gyarados and Lucario. Also, Trick is a vital move on this team, seeing as it supports the star player. Originally, this team had three Trick users, but unfortunately, I had to limit it to just this guy, for the overall good of the team. HP Fighting destroys TTars that think they’re smart and switch in. It’s a 2HKO on even the bulkiest TTars if I have enough entry hazards set up.</p>

<p><strong>Forretress</strong> @ Shed Shell<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Toxic Spikes<br />
- Payback<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Rapid Spin</p>

<p>Forretress really supports the team like no other Pokemon could. Getting up Toxic and regular Spikes, while spinning away my opponent’s. Payback hits a lot of its common switch ins hard, including Starmie and Rotom. Payback and this much SDef allows this thing to even beat certain types of Latias’s. If I manage to kill my opponent’s SRer, and spin with this guy, I will gain a huge advantage by allowing my Gyarados to come and go freely. I decided to go with Shed Shell, because of the spike in Magnezones I have been seeing, and the fact that this guy is so key to my team’s success. However, since the addition of Shed Shell, I have considered changing the EV spread slightly, so that I could take Physical hits with greater ease.</p>

<p><strong>Gyarados</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 200 Def / 40 SpD / 16 Spe<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Rest<br />
- Roar<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>

<p>Standard RestTalk Roar Gyarados. This Pokemon is insanely annoying, as many people can attest to. It basically will only die to Rock or Electric type attacks and nothing else, especially if I can spin the rocks away. This guy provides the team with the always welcome Intimidate, while also fulfilling the status absorbing role. Some of you might think that having two Roarers is redundant, but I couldn’t disagree more. With entry hazards laid out, Phazing can really lay down the hurt. It also allows me to keep an eye out for Pokemon that could possibly stop the star of the show, which is…</p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 18 SpA / 100 SpD / 140 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Torment<br />
- Protect<br />
- Lava Plume</p>

<p>This. Thing. Is. A. Beast. If I can get a Sub up successfully, you aren’t going to touch me for a while. If your Heatran check is choice’d, then I will just laugh as you struggle and kill yourself. Even if it’s not choice’d, most Pokemon cannot touch me, because people rarely have more than one move that can successfully break this beast’s subs. This is how it works:</p>

<p>You switch in on my Sub. I use Torment as you break my Sub. Then I Sub again while you cannot use your Super Effective move on me that turn. Then I use Protect when you try to use it again. Now I’m safe to use Lava Plum while knowing that you cannot break my Sub with a Super Effective hit. If you try to set up against me, then you run the risk of getting Burned, which many set-up sweepers do not want to do.</p>

<p>There are, of course, a few things that will beat this set, such as non-choice’d Heatrans, Gyarados (if they don’t get Burned), Swampert (though they lose a heavy load of health breaking my Subs from Toxic Spikes), and anything with Rest. However, I can usually successfully scout, and neutralize those threats before this guy comes into play at the end of the match. I like to Trick Rotom’s Scarf onto something, while sacrificing himself, so that Heatran can come in on a hopefully-resisted attack. The whole team is built around getting this guy to take out full teams, and it rarely ever loses. In fact, the few losses that this team has seen can be mostly attributed to player error or hax, not in flaws in the team itself. I spent a lot of time getting this team as close to perfect as I could, and am very proud of the final results.</p>

<p>Although not every set on this RMT is my own, I still hope the original sets that it has encourages many of you to go out and create your own sets as well, instead of just using the well-known standards. Creativity is what makes this game fun and exciting, and I love seeing new things! Thanks for checking my team out.</p>
