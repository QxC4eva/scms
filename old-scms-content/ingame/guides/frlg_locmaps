<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The following list is a compendium for every competitively viable and/or helpful item found within the FireRed and LeafGreen games as well as their location. Please note that there are indeed a few TMs and items missing from this list. This is because those TMs (such as TM03 Water Pulse) are not competitively viable, and therefore unnecessary to find.</p>
