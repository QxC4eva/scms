<p>Base Power = (Target's current Speed / User's current Speed) * 25, rounded down, + 1, but not more than 150.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Gyro Ball is an excellent attack for naturally slow Steel-types. Popular users include Forretress, Bronzong, and Ferrothorn, all of which don't mind moving second and love the extra power Gyro Ball brings.
