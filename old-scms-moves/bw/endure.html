The user always survives with at least 1 HP.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user will survive attacks made by other Pokemon during this turn with at least 1 HP. This attack has a 1/X chance of being successful, where X starts at 1 and doubles each time this move is successfully used. X resets to 1 if this attack fails or if the user's last used move is not Detect, Endure, Protect, Quick Guard, or Wide Guard. If X is 256 or more, this move has a 1/(2^32) chance of being successful. Fails if the user moves last this turn. This move has a priority of +4.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While Endure may seem interesting, it has little competitive bearing. After all, what can a Pokemon do at 1 HP? Most Pokemon with Endure do not have the Speed to guarantee an Endeavor will hit. Furthermore, the prevalence of sandstorm makes 1 HP essentially the same as 0 HP. One is better off dealing damage or setting up then using Endure.</p>
