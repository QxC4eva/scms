Switches items with the target.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>User exchanges held item with that of the target. Fails if either the user or the target is holding a Mail, if neither is holding an item, or if the user is trying to give or take a Griseous Orb, a Plate, or a Drive to or from a Giratina, an Arceus, or a Genesect, respectively. Pokemon with the ability Sticky Hold are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Beyond its much more limited distribution, Switcheroo is identical to Trick. As such, all of the excellent disruptive strategies that are used with Trick carry over to Switcheroo as well; feel free to Switcheroo around troublesome items to your heart's content. Notable users of this move include Manectric, who can Switcheroo Choice Specs and Choice Scarf onto special walls, as well as Whimsicott, who—in doubles—can Switcheroo a Lagging Tail onto one of your opponent's Pokemon and still move first on that turn thanks to Prankster.</p>
