<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3446739">Tomohawk</a> is the most recently created Pokemon by the 

Create-A-Pokemon (CAP) project. Tomohawk is the first Pokemon output by the CAP project for the fifth generation, 

and what a first Pokemon it was. In the voting stages for the Topic Leader (TL), a lot of emphasis was given to 

the tumultuous metagame shifts of BW OU, and so the TL was chosen such that he would be able to handle the 

shifting metagame with gusto. reachzero, a frequent player of BW OU, was chosen as our TL, and immediately a 

massive competitive focus was given to our CAP, more so than usual. Unlike some past CAPs, where much focus was 

given to analyzing interesting concepts, this focus was totally focused upon merging into the BW OU metagame and 

giving an already restless metagame something to chew on while not changing the game too much. The goal was to 

inject a Pokemon into the game without making too much of a paradigm shift, and see how that concept operated.</p>

<h2>What it was supposed to do</h2>

<p>Tomohawk was built on a concept that no one really understood that well. It's something that competitive 

Pokemon players talk about a lot, but when confronted about what it means, usually can't muster an adequate 

response. Korski was the one that supplied this CAP's concept, and that concept is as follows:</p>

<div style="border: solid 1px #adadad; background-color: #ededed; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
<p><strong>Concept:</strong><br />
Momentum</p>

<p><strong>General Description:</strong><br />
This will be a Pokemon that can be utilized to gain or regain momentum for a player's team at any point in the 

match as its primary function.</p>

<p><strong>Justification:</strong><br />
Gen. 5 is a very powerful metagame. As such, most battles are won by the smarter strategist who can best maneuver 

around his/her opponent's onslaught to gain even a single turn's advantage, potentially clinching them the match. 

This process of gaining and regaining momentum is most often the defining element that makes a winner and a loser 

out of a single Pokemon battle. Any top player in this metagame should agree that momentum is the most crucial 

element in any given match; however, "momentum" itself is a rather vaguely defined term that is never really 

explored in concrete terms. Is it keeping opposing teams on the defensive? Forcing switches? Good prediction? 

Spamming U-turn? These have all been approaches to achieving momentum, but they are also player-side and largely 

synonymous with "strategy," as opposed to Pokemon-side and regarding a Pokemon's role on the team. Certainly there 

are threats like Ferrothorn/Gliscor (defensive) and Scizor/Latios/Voltlos, etc., etc. (offensive) that can achieve 

momentum as we know it, but there is no current niche for a "momentum Pokemon" because the concept has been purely 

delegated to players and not to Pokemon.</p>

<p><strong>Questions To Be Answered:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How do we define momentum in terms of competitive Pokemon? What factors make current Pokemon able to achieve 

momentum and how can we incorporate that information into a successful CAP?</li>
<li>How do different styles of play (Weather-based offense, stall, bulky offense, etc.) use momentum to achieve 

their goals and how can our CAP play to those strategies in an effort to take their momentum away?</li>
<li>What type of traditional role (sweeper, tank, wall, support) would a Pokemon like this most resemble? Would it 

have to be able to fit more than one of these roles to fit in a variety of teams?</li>
<li>How will the different playstyles be affected by the addition of a Pokemon that can regain offensive/defensive 

momentum at any given point? Will offensive teams play more conservatively? Will defensive teams play more 

recklessly? Will everything simply adapt to a new threat and move on normally?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The concept was momentum. Everyone knows that when your Scizor scores a U-turn against a switch-in, it 

maintains momentum. Everyone knows that when you limit your opponent's options against you, you are gaining 

momentum. But virtually no one knew how you could <em>build</em> a Pokemon so that it's sole purpose was to steal 

and gain momentum for you at any point in the game. Since so few people understood what exactly momentum was, a 

huge discussion took place with the TL and ATL at the head, trying to wrap the public's mind around the concept 

and get them acquainted with the idea that killing your opponent's entire team wasn't the kind of momentum that we 

wanted. Similarly, we didn't want a generic U-turn spammer, since that merely preserves momentum, it doesn't gain 

more for you. For what we had set out to create, we needed something that could come in on a swath of the 

metagame, threaten it out with its options, achieve something for your team, and do so reliably throughout the 

match.</p>

<p>And so we set out to create the beast that ended up being Tomohawk. Through much discussion, we decided that 

Tomohawk should be threatened by many of the special sweeping attacking types and many of the popular special 

sweepers of the game. Tomohawk should then have a typing appropriate for switching into and threatening the many 

physical attackers of the tier, so that it has numerous opportunities to come in on the likes of Garchomp, 

Excadrill, Landorus, Terrakion, and so forth. With that in mind, let's see what Tomohawk <em>actually</em> 

did..</p>

<h2>What it did</h2>

<p>Tomohawk worked and worked well. When it entered into the metagame, it operated as intended. Tomohawk's ability 

to use Rapid Spin made it excel at stealing momentum immediately against teams that used the ever-popular 

Ferrothorn or Skarmory. Access to Intimidate and Taunt let it come in and pretty much do whatever it wanted 

against the Pokemon it checked without issue. Pokemon like Reuniclus, Thundurus, and Tornadus would switch into 

Tomohawk reliably, either letting the player score a KO with a sneak attack, set up his or her strategy and get 

out to a check, or double switch to gain and keep momentum. For all intents and purposes, Tomohawk was a success, 

and the people rejoiced. The most popular Tomohawk set for the playtest used both Taunt and Roost to keep itself 

healthy and shut its opponents down, while it smashed its enemies with a combination of either Aura Sphere and 

Hurricane or Aura Sphere and Air Slash. A second popular set that really put a spin on momentum grabber was the 

Toxic stalling set, where Tomohawk would poison vulnerable Pokemon and stall them out with ease, or hit the 

Pokemon immune to Toxic hard with its STAB attacks. Coupled with Prankster, Tomohawk could nearly always go first 

and keep itself healthy with Roost, protected with Substitute, or poisoning the entire team with Toxic. Below, the 

leftmost set is the typical TauntRoost bulky attacker set, while the rightmost set is the Toxic stalling set. Both 

of these achieved the goal of the concept expertly.</p>

<p>Tomohawk also had some other interesting options that players abused, such as a Baton Pass set that prioritized 

passing away very bulky Substitutes to other Pokemon, like Thundurus, that appreciate the coverage turn to set up 

a Nasty Plot. All of these things secured momentum for the team on a whim, which was really cool to see play out 

on the ladder. My personal experience showed the greatest success with the bulky attacker set, while I also 

personally used the Toxic stalling set to great success too. </p>

<p>One of the options that Tomohawk had that some people felt made it not fit the concept was the move Hurricane. 

Hurricane with STAB made Tomohawk a potent threat on a team with Drizzle Politoed, especially combined with a 

powerful secondary STAB in Fighting that something like Tornadus lacks. Still, in practice, the threat of the 

Choice Specs sweeper Tomohawk was alleviated by how opposing rain threats destroyed it. Opposing Tornadus were not 

only faster, but stronger. Similarly, Thundurus and rain-boosted Water-type attacks simply ripped through Tomohawk 

and didn't give it a chance to switch in. Tomohawk, in terms of the weather war, paired best with Tyranitar, since 

it neutralized opposing sand-based physical threats. Ultimately, despite the threat of strong-arm Tomohawk, it 

just didn't pan out as well in practice against opponent's of equal skill. Of course, sometimes it was nice to 

back Tomohawk up with rain on a new alt to shred some newcomers, but that's beside the point, right?</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>

<p>To all the nay-sayers I say: Tomohawk succeeded. Some people would say that achieving a momentum concept is in 

itself suspect since any good Pokemon achieves momentum, but we not only achieved momentum with Tomohawk, we 

achieved the right <em>kind</em> of momentum that we set out to achieve. We focused on offensive momentum that 

wasn't all about just murdering Pokemon, but getting in, doing a job, and getting out. Tomohawk did just that. In 

order to really analyze what about the concept succeeded through Tomohawk, let's answer those lovely questions 

provided to us by the concept itself.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How do we define momentum in terms of competitive Pokemon? What factors make current Pokemon able to 

achieve momentum and how can we incorporate that information into a successful CAP?</strong><br />
<p>It's interesting that sometimes in a concept, the success of the concept isn't necessarily in creating a 

Pokemon that has all of the desired qualities, but <em>through</em> the creation of the Pokemon teaching the 

player base what exactly it is the concept is even about in the first place. Tomohawk helped players understand 

that momentum isn't just about KOing Pokemon or spamming U-turn, but achieving temporary strategies successfully 

that play into your grand strategy of cornering the opponent, limiting their options, and ultimately breaking 

their 6 Pokemon. Discussions were had along the way that helped users grasp the concept of momentum, and through 

those discussions I can say that the above questions were answered. Because I know you're dying for a straight 

answer, I'll give you one: momentum is an abstract concept that, when possessed, literally means that you have 

more options available to you than your opponent, and ultimately will lead to your victory if you can maintain it 

throughout the battle. Giving yourself the cards that let you beat your opponent is what it's all about.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>How do different styles of play (Weather-based offense, stall, bulky offense, etc.) use momentum to 

achieve their goals and how can our CAP play to those strategies in an effort to take their momentum 

away?</strong><br />
<p>Even through the rain-based teams that abused Tomohawk to sweep, we found that every type of team uses momentum 

differently. Whether it be that you need Tomohawk to check opposing physical threats and then smash switch-ins, 

stall through defensive walls with Toxic, or generally harass an opposing balanced team with a combination of 

Taunt and strong attacking options, it had the options necessary to pull off the momentum-grabber role. And let's 

not forget Rapid Spin, no; Rapid Spin during the playtest led many a team to victory thanks to the ultimate of 

momentum-grabbing moves' removing an opponent's hard-placed Spikes or Stealth Rock. These are the strategies that 

our CAP could use to secure momentum, and through using Tomohawk, we now better understand how <em>other</em> 

Pokemon can use these strategies to build momentum.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>What type of traditional role (sweeper, tank, wall, support) would a Pokemon like this most resemble? 

Would it have to be able to fit more than one of these roles to fit in a variety of teams?</strong><br />
<p>It turned out in our case that the traditional role that Tomohawk would best fit into is bulky special 

attacker, or tank. Sort of like a retooled DPP Swampert, Tomohawk had options to get in, execute its strategy, and 

be a general annoyance and cornerstone to the team that an opponent would have to get by in order to be able to 

gain their own momentum. Also, we can now say that Tomohawk doesn't have to have a billion options in order to fit 

into a variety of teams. I want to say that having Prankster helped Tomohawk a lot and gave it necessary options 

in order to be able to successfully corner an opponent. A one-dimensional Pokemon is not very good at scoring 

momentum; it's quite the opposite, in-fact, it cedes a lot of momentum. (Just take a look at Gliscor!)</p>
</li>
<li><strong>How will the different playstyles be affected by the addition of a Pokemon that can regain 

offensive/defensive momentum at any given point? Will offensive teams play more conservatively? Will defensive 

teams play more recklessly? Will everything simply adapt to a new threat and move on normally?</strong><br />
<p>This is probably my favorite of all of the questions. How did the metagame react? I want to say that, like all 

threats, Pokemon raised and fell in usage to beat the addition of a new one. Defensive teams did have to adjust 

their archetype in order to be able to punch through a bulky Toxic-stalling Tomohawk, and offensive teams often 

had to switch more in order to keep their sweepers safe until a Tomohawk had been removed. This isn't really a 

surprise in hindsight, but before the playtest, few people could really pinpoint exactly how the metagame would 

react. Like I always say, now we know the rest of the story.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Since I played such a big role in Tomohawk's creation as ATL, I'm sure you're expecting me by now to pat all of 

CAP on the back for such a successful CAP. Well, I won't do quite that, but if you asked me if I felt that 

Tomohawk succeeded at its goal, I would say that it had. I know that I, personally, understand competitive 

Pokemon's version of momentum a lot better than I did at the outset of this CAP, and I know that others in the 

community feel the same way. Not all CAPs are successful, and yeah, a few of our past creations are amusingly 

erroneous in how we went about creating them to fit their concepts. That said, it's all a learning process, and so 

long as we remember that it's all about the process and not necessarily the result, you'll see what I mean when I 

say that CAP did a good job here.</p>

<p>Hopefully the next CAP is as successful as this past one was, and I hope, now that you've read a bit about the 

learning process, you'll think of participating in it! If you ever want to learn more about the process, the <a 

href="/cap/">CAP site</a> is a good place to start, and when the next one begins, it'll be posted and detailed in 

the <a href="">CAP forum</a>. I know that the CAP site isn't really updated, but that is unavoidable given how 

busy everyone has been with everything else in Smogon. It'll be updated in due time. Either way, I hope to see you 

in the CAP forum for the next CAP when it kicks off!</p>
