<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Helping Hand is useless in singles. In doubles, however, it is an excellent support move to help your partner Pokemon net crucial KOs. The simple combination of Helping Hand and a spread move can wreak havoc on the foe's side of the field. Cresselia is a classic user of Helping Hand and pairs well with Garchomp, as it allows Garchomp to fire off immensely powerful Earthquakes. Other good candidates include Musharna and Gardevoir, who can Helping Hand and ignore unwanted damage from their partner thanks to Telepathy.</p>
