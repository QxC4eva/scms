Only super effective attacks harm the wielder. 

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The wielder can only be damaged by super effective attacks. Wonder Guard only prevents direct damage from attacks, such as the damage received from <a href="/bw/moves/tackle">Tackle</a>. It does not prevent any other form of damage, such as the damage from weather conditions or <a href="/bw/moves/leech_seed">Leech Seed</a>. If the wielder uses a recoil move, it will still take normal recoil damage. <a href="/bw/moves/struggle">Struggle</a> will hit through Wonder Guard, despite not being a super effective attack. Fixed damage attacks will only damage the wielder if it would be super effective otherwise. That is, <a href="/bw/moves/night_shade">Night Shade</a> counts as a Ghost-type attack, <a href="/bw/moves/seismic_toss">Seismic Toss</a> counts as a Fighting-type attack, and <a href="/bw/moves/dragon_rage">Dragon Rage</a> counts as a Dragon-type attack.</p>

<p>The wielder is unaffected by <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>, but Wonder Guard can be copied via <a href="/bw/abilities/trace">Trace</a>. Also, Wonder Guard can be copied by an opposing Pokemon transforming into the wielder.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Wonder Guard is only available on one Pokemon, which is <a href="/bw/pokemon/shedinja">Shedinja</a>. In fact, it is the only reason that Shedinja is usable at all, but really, it has no place in OU, due to the fact that sandstorm and <a href="/bw/moves/stealth_rock">Stealth Rock</a> will KO it immediately. Instead, if you are going to use Shedinja it would be recommended to use it in Ubers, where there isn't as much hurtful weather to hit through Wonder Guard, and where Shedinja can be hit by fewer types for super effective damage. Because Shedinja is on one of the least usable Pokemon in the game, and because Wonder Guard is not available on any other Pokemon, its competitive use is extremely limited.</p>
