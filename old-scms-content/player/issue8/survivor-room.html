<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Survivor room, which room Owner Quarkz defines as a "social room for people of all experience to hang out, play a game, and have fun!" I might have zero skill when it comes to competitive battling, but I know a thing or two about the survivor games! Aknolan, another one of the room Owners, will be tagging along with me to help familliarize the community with the Survivor room and all the game themes it has! (We'll be mostly focusing on introducing all the game themes.)</p>
<p>Let's start off with some frequently asked questions:</p>

<h2>How do I get involved with the room?</h2>
<p>Room Owner Quarkz suggests that you "just jump into a game and get to know the people in the room; it's a fairly well-knit community, and you will only get to know it by interacting with it. Just read the rules of course".</p>

<h3>How can I host a game? </h3>
<p>You'll need permission from a staff member to host a game. After that you'll be given a temporary room Voice and you're ready to go! Before seeking permission however, make sure that you have played a few games first. This ensures that you know the rules and have playing experience.</p>

<h3>When I'm hosting, how do I announce it?</h3>
<p>It's pretty simple: just use bold letters so you can stand out from others and say what theme you're going to host.</p>
<div class="log">
    <p>%<strong style="color:hsl(234,75%,30%);">MyWay21</strong>: <strong>Hosting Classic, type "/me in" to join!</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>How do I determine who wins when someone attacks another player?</h3>
<p>We use the !roll or !dice command for that. It's pretty much the reason you need to ask the staff for a temporary room Voice before hosting, since you cant use the ! commands without it. Anyways, once you use the command, the player who got the higher roll wins.</p>
<p>Note that some themes have different rules. We will take a look at some of them later.</p>
<div class="log">
    <p>+<strong style="color:hsl(274,86%,42%);">Prince Phantom</strong>: aleuser attacks evilsaiyan!</p>
    <p>+<strong style="color:hsl(274,86%,42%);">Prince Phantom</strong>: rolling for aleuser</p>
    <p>+<strong style="color:hsl(274,86%,42%);">Prince Phantom</strong>: !dice 100</p>
    <p>Random number (1 - 100): 70</p>
</div>

<h3>How do I roll for an alliance, as there is more than one person now?</h3>
<p>You use !roll/dice 2d100. If there are 3 people, it would be 3d100, and so on.</p>

<div class="log">
    <p>%<strong style="color:hsl(264,52%,35%);">Bon Dance</strong>: !roll 2d 100</p>
    <p>Random number 2x(1 - 100): 59, 95</p>
    <p>Total: 154</p>
</div>

<h4>So, the alliance above rolled a 154? That's a lot.</h4>
<p>No, in Classic you count the higher number as the roll of the alliance, which means they rolled 95.</p>

<h2>Hunger Games and Classic</h2>
<p>Before we start to explain the other themes, let's take a look at Hunger Games and Classic. These two games are considered the two basic themes the Survivor room has.</p>
<p>Classic, or Classique, which is what some people like to call it, is a pretty simple theme where you can team up with other players and have an option of betraying them. Of course, those who join together in an alliance have an advantage over others. It is also not uncommon for a single individual to destroy a whole alliance with a lucky dice roll! Overall, Classic is a pretty simple game mode, and it's a great start for inexperienced players who want to start hosting.</p>
<p>Hunger Games (HG) is the same as Classic, but you can't make alliances. That's right; you're gonna have to survive by yourself. Don't worry though; you can make truces with other players. There's really not much to say about HG other than the fact that it's also a great theme for new hosts to begin with.</p>

<h2>Hunger Games Anonymous</h2>
<p>One of the most popular themes that the Survivor room has to offer, Hunger Games Anonymous (HGA), is a version of Hunger Games with a little twist. Each player will have a different nickname; in other words, everyone's anonymous! Here's an important thing some people get wrong when playing this for the first time: You don't actually change your nickname using the "/nick" command; the host will tell you your new alias, and the official player list will be announced before all the nicknames are told to everyone. The host also has two options: Let the players PM you the nicknames they've chosen, or give everyone the nicknames you made.</p>
<p>Once the player list has been shown, you should PM the host the nickname you wish to attack. Therefore, if Aknolan's nickname is Bob and Quarkz sent a PM to the host that he wants to attack Bob, Aknolan will be attacked.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong> You don't have to, but you should try to stay anonymous when possible. Try not to reveal yourself by reacting when you've been attacked.</em></p>

<h2>Dexterity</h2>
<p>This theme also functions similarly to HG but has quite a different battle system. Players are able to choose their weapons, which have different Attack and accuracy. Before we continue, let's check out what the weapons are:</p>
<div class="nudge">
    <p><strong>Twig&mdash;</strong>a 50-sided dice with 100% accuracy</p>
    <p><strong>Club&mdash;</strong>a 75-sided dice with 85% accuracy</p>
    <p><strong>Classic Sword&mdash;</strong>a 100-sided dice with with 70% accuracy</p>
    <p><strong>Jabulin of Pain&mdash;</strong>a 125-sided dice with 50% accuracy</p>
    <p><strong>Sofa of Median&mdash;</strong>a 135-sided dice with 40% accuracy</p>
    <p><strong>Mass O' Ax&mdash;</strong>a 150-sided dice with 30% accuracy</p>
    <p><strong>30-Pound Lance of Diamond known simply as DEATH!&mdash;</strong>a 200-sided dice with 10% accuracy</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see, accuracy plays a big part in this game theme. You might be wondering, how accuracy works. Well, you use the "!dice 100" command, and if the rolled number is below the accuracy percentage, the attack misses. You'll PM the host your weapon of choice, which will be used in both your Attack and Defense rolls. Weapons can also be changed between attacking phases.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong> If you're hosting, make sure you announce when you're rolling for accuracy and who are you rolling for, to avoid confusion.</em></p>

<h2>Poles</h2>
<p>Poles is a game mode that became popular among the community and made it to the official list of themes. With a minimum of four players, this HG-based theme has a few interesting twists.</p>
<p>When you attack someone and successfully kill them, you will get two points. You gain one point every you kill a player who is attacking you. If you are killed, you won't be eliminated from the game. This is the only game theme that has two ways you can make it to the final phase. You can take the first route: Be the first player to reach get five points before anyone else does, or the second one: Be the player with the fewest points when someone reaches five points. Here's the part that's making makes this theme so much different than the others: Each player gets three cards that they can use only once. Let's check out what the cards are:</p>
<div class="nudge">
    <h4>Spore</h4>
    <p>Effect: Puts the target to sleep and makes her attack fail.</p>
    <p>Used: At the beginning of the turn on any player.</p>
    <p>Example Strategy: If you are going for first, use this on the person who has the most points. If you are going for last, use this on yourself.</p>

    <h4>Will-O-Wisp</h4>
    <p>Effect: Burns the target, dropping his Attack stat, and making him roll 70.</p>
    <p>Used: Before an attack on either the attacking or defending player.</p>
    <p>Example Strategy: If you are going for first, use this on the person you’re attacking. If you are going for last, use this on yourself.</p>

    <h4>Helping Hand</h4>
    <p>Effect: Boosts the power of the target's Attack, making their roll him !roll 130.</p>
    <p>Used: Before an attack on either the attacking or defending player.</p>
    <p>Example Strategy: If you are going for last, use this on the person you’re attacking. If you are going for first, use this on yourself.</p>
</div>
<p>After someone gets five points, he will battle the person with the fewest of points in a normal survivor battle. Whoever gets the higher roll wins.</p>

<h2>RPG Survivor</h2>
<p>In this game mode, you are always solo, and for the rest, this game mode follows the mechanics of its name. When you beat someone, you get experience points, the how many of which you get is based on how much higher your roll was; for example, if your opponent rolls 1 and you roll 100, you gain 99 experience points (very extreme case here). You can spend experience points in a set of stats: Attack, Intelligence, Defense, HP, Dexterity and Speed.</p>
<div class="nudge">
    <p><strong>Attack:</strong> Adds on to your roll; for example, if you roll 85 and you have 10 Attack, your total roll will be 90.</p>
    <p><strong>Intelligence:</strong> Starts at level 100 and acts as your roll when attacking you attack someone. Adding experience points increases the number of sides on your dice; for example, if you add 10 to Intelligence you will have a 110-sided die.</p>
    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Equivalent to the Attack stat but this one is for when someone else attacks you!</p>
    <p><strong>HP:</strong> Equivalent to Intelligence but applies when someone else decides to attack you.</p>
    <p><strong>Dexterity:</strong> Dexterity is a pretty interesting and important stat: the stat level divided by 2 rounded down is needed as an extra to beat someone. For example, if you have 10 in Dexterity, an attacker's roll must have at least 5 higher than yours; therefore, if you roll 95 and the attacker has a 100-sided die, you can't be beaten if you have a Dexterity stat of 10.</p>
    <p><strong>Speed:</strong> Determines priority; for example, if you have 1 Speed and the attacker has 0, you roll first.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ghosts</h2>
<p>This theme has a very strange mechanic. If a player dies, they will turn into a ghost instead of being removed from the game. The only way for the humans to kill ghosts is through the ghost hunter. If there are four players, there will be one ghost hunter. The last person standing will be the winner, as usual, but sometimes it is actually a ghost who is the last alive. This theme can quickly get very complex with all the ghosts going around. Ghosts can't kill humans normally either though; if a ghost attacks a human, there's a roll out of 100, and the loser has a 50% chance to die. If there are six players, there will also be a ghost spy, with twelve players there will be two ghost spies, and so on. The ghost spy is the only ghost that can normally kill and be killed by humans.</p>
<em>"I like its simplicity and how similar it is to the classic theme. However, it still offers an interesting twist to the game without being too confusing." &mdash;Quarkz</em>

<h2>Tower Defense</h2>
<p>This is a game mode where you usually work with teams. With four players, for example, there could be teams of two or four teams of one; similarly, with six players, there can be two teams of three, three teams of two, or six teams of one. The players may make alliances, but they need to abide by the team size limit. This theme takes a very long time to play because the goal isn't to immediately kill the players, but to destroy the tower. The host chooses how many points the tower will have and what the rolls will be in. Once that is all done and decided, the teams will carry out their first attacks or defends. Seeing as there is no option to betray in this game mode, it would be a bit annoying to be left without a tower, right? When your tower gets destroyed, you die with it. Only when defenders lose a roll against someone will the tower lose points, with the amount of points lost being decided by (the roll of the attacker) - (the roll of the defender). You win when your tower is the last still standing.</p>

<h2>Capture the flag</h2>
<p>This is a theme where you work in teams to capture the flag. It won't be easy, though, as first, of all you need to get past all the defenders, then you need to find the flag, and finally, you need to make sure not to die while getting back!</p>
<p>Though that is not all; there is more to this game. First of all, let's discuss the classes. There is the Tank class: If a Tank dies, it will revive a few turns later; specifically, the first time,he will revive 2 turns later; the second time, four; the third time, six; and so on.</p>
<p>Another class is the Warrior: The Warrior has +15 on rolls and a +25% chance to kill defenders. For example, if a Warrior rolls 100, the roll will be boosted to 115 instead. The chance to kill defenders is normally 75% already meaning the Warrior is guaranteed to kill a defender he defeats. The downside to the Warrior is that it can't defend (when defending, you stay back to make sure opponents can't just grab your flag).</p>
<p>There's also an action where you try to revive a team member called "heal." The chance of healing is 10%, which is a little low, but don't worry! That's why we have a medic! A medic can't attack but has an extra 20% chance of healing someone for a total of 30%. When healing you must be careful though; if the player you're trying to heal was attacking, or capturing the flag, or even healing someone else who died while attacking or capturing the flag when they died, you have a 40% chance to get noticed by the defenders. However, if the person died while defending, you will be safe.</p>
<p>Another role is the Scout: The Scout has a 10% chance to go attacking instead of defending. The scout has -5 on his rolls, so if a Scout rolls 100, he will get 95 instead. The good part about having a Scout though is that every team member has a +10% to actually find the flag.</p>
<p>The last class is the King: While the King might sound as like a powerful class, it really isn't. The King is a supportive class. While the King is alive, you will get a +10 boost to your rolls, so if you roll 80, you will get 90. The King himself, however, gets a -50 debuff to his rolls, so if a King rolls 89, the roll will end up as 39 instead. If a King is beaten, he is guaranteed to die.</p>
<p>Those are all the roles; now, let's go over the actions. The first action is attacking: You choose an enemy to attack and when you do so, there's a 50% chance defenders will notice and attack you. If you defeat your target or a defender, they have a 75% chance to die unless a role is modifying that. Another action is healing, which is explained in the description of the medic role. The most important action is capturing the flag. If you capture the flag, you win. The chance of finding the flag is -5x + 40, where x is the number of players on the other team. If there's a Scout on your team, you have a +10% chance to find the flag. Before you get to capturing the flag, there's a 50% chance of being attacked by defenders and after trying to find the flag, there's also a 50% chance of being attacked by defenders, making it hard to capture the flag if there are still opposing defenders alive. The last action is defending. You can either choose to defend or defend after your action is over, as every alive player defends once their action is done. There is no option to do nothing.</p>

<h2>Alliances in the dark (AITD)</h2>
<p>Another spin on the Classic game mode, this very confusing theme lets you have alliances, but they are not revealed, and you have an option of being in multiple alliances at once. Everyone will also have additional time for the first phase. After PMing others and making the alliances, you message the host your alliances like this:</p>
<div class="nudge">
    <p>Alliance 1: Aknolan and Quarkz</p>
    <p>Alliance 2: Meteordash, Kabuchops, and Ninety Nine</p>
    <p>Alliance 3: Quarkz and Swirlyder</p>
</div>
<p>If all of the members of an alliance agree, you can choose to reveal your team. You are able to attack together as an alliance or on your own. If you think you've found an alliance, you can attack, but if you were wrong, the people who you attacked will be revealed as being alone and the attack will fail. If you were correct and win against the alliance, the alliance you attacked with will be revealed. If your team lost, the alliance you attacked will be revealed. It's also possible to betray others in this game; it can be a betrayal against one person or against a whole alliance. If you're a player, don't forget that this is a complicated theme, and you should be patient with the host, as it can be hard to keep track of everything with all the hidden alliances and tricks players can pull off.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong> This is a theme you need to try and host in order to understand it better, but don't try it unless you have experience with other game modes.</em></p>

<h2>Gear up!</h2>
<p>New themes in Survivor, as you may have noticed, are mostly created by adding one or more new mechanics to Hunger Games. In this case, the mechanic is gear! You gain these items at the beginning of the game, in between phases, or by defeating your opponents and taking his gear.When equipped, these items give you various Attack and Defense boosts. You can check out all the boosts right <a href="http://survivor-ps.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/5/0/26505796/594408978.png">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how the Defense and Attack boosts works, it's pretty simple. When someone attacks another player, he is using his Attack roll, which will be obviously boosted by the Attack boosts of his gear. The roll used for the attacked, or defending, player is the Defense roll, which gets boosted by the Defense boosts of the equipped items. These boosts modify your standard roll; for example, if you have an Attack boost of 20, your roll will be increased from 100 to 120. We also have items called enchantments in play, which don't increase your rolling number but directly boost the number you rolled.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't forget that you can only take one of your opponent's items when you defeat them!</em></p>

<h2>Pok&eacute;mon Survivor</h2>
<p>Pok&eacute;mon Survivor is one of the Survivor room's most popular themes and the only one that actually involves battling with Pok&eacute;mon. Your host will use "/roll 718" for each of the players so they can get a Pok&eacute;mon they will use to battle. The battles that happen between an attacker and a defender will be done in a 1v1 format, so everything that's banned in 1v1 will be rerolled if this happens. If your Pok&eacute;mon has an evolution or Mega Evolution, feel free to evolve and Mega Evolve them, respectively. And of course, scouting is not allowed!</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip for the host:</strong> After you PM everyone the Pok&eacute;mon they got, make sure that you keep track of and be informed about each battle.</em></p>

<h2>The Survivor Ladder</h2>
<p>An exciting feature for the whole Survivor community, the Survivor ladder, was created to add an even more competitive factor to the room. This ladder was active for a period of one month, with the staff of the room hosting official ladder games and players gaining points through getting first, second, or third place. Our winner got room Voice; unfortunately, the ladder itself is currently inactive, but is expected to return soon.</p>

<p>And that's it! If you have any more queries you can check out <a href="http://survivor-ps.weebly.com/">our website</a> where there is documentation of all our themes or even just come in and ask! We hope to see you here in the Survivor room soon!</p>
