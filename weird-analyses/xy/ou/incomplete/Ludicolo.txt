Overview
########

    Has a good typing, which can be used with or against rain teams well
    Has two great rain-abusing abilities, in the forms of swift swim and rain dish
    Well-rounded stats makes it somewhat unpredictable in what he is trying to accomplish
    Lacks good power or speed without the rain compensating for it and has lackluster physical defense
    Opposing rain teams are now less common, thanks to drizzle's nerf, which spoils Ludicolo's purpose as a rain team counter and will be obsolete in more matches in that role
    Has a horrible support movepool, can only really provide rain or Leech Seed healing for it's teammates, but has a good attacking movepool
    Synthesis is his only reliable recovery move which lacks PP and works badly in the rain
    Needs rain up to be very useful

Special Rain Sweeper
########
Name: Special Rain Sweeper
Move 1: Hydro Pump
Move 2: Giga Drain/Energy Ball
Move 3: Ice Beam
Move 4: Focus Blast/Rain Dance
Ability: Swift Swim
Item: Life Orb/Damp Rock
EVs: 4 HP, 252 SpAtt, 252 Spe
Nature: Timid/Modest

Moves
========

    Hydro Pump is Ludicolo's strongest move when complemented with rain and hits most things hard that do not resist
    Giga Drain is Ludicolo's other STAB option that is reliable, fairly powerful, and somewhat removes Life Orb recoil, this can be switched for energy ball for more power, which nets a few important things when running timid and Life Orb, such as the guaranteed OHKO on offensive Keldeo, but loses out on the longetivity of running Giga Drain
    Ice Beam creates nearly perfect neutral coverage, as it hits Dragon-types and Grass-types hard that resist Ludicolo's STABs
    Focus Blast hits Ferrothorn, Mega Abomasnow, and Tyranitar hard, 2HKOing them, which can help clear them out for other rain sweepers, or if they aren't a problem, you can run rain dance to make Ludicolo self reliant, or a team supporter.


Set Details
========

    Swift Swim is a great ability as it allows Ludicolo to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame
    The choice between Life Orb and Damp Rock is if you are looking for Ludicolo to do major damage, or if you want to support other teammates as well as be a threat itself if needed
    The EV's are straightforward, max out your Special Attack and Speed to become as threatening as possible, while dumping the leftover 4 into HP
    A Timid nature lets you outspeed choice scarf base 108 speed pokemon and lower, which is a really good benchmark to hit, while modest gives you more power and lets you outspeed choice scarfed base 95 pokemon and lower, which is still good, but you are more likely to be revenge killed. It is also worth noting that ludicolo is weak to no regular priority moves, so it can be hard to handle if Life Orb hasn't weakened him enough.

Usage Tips
========

    Get rain up and sweep or go to another another rain-abuser

Team Options
========

    Strong Fighting-types, such as Lucario or Keldeo that can take care of Ferrothorn if Ludicolo is not running Focus Blast, otherwise he has trouble even 3HKOing Ferrothorn
    Fast Electric-types, like Mega Manectric, Thundurus, or Raikou, that can abuse the rain via Thunder and handle Talonflame, which can easily revenge kill Ludicolo
    Politoed to set up rain automatically for the team and handle Ninetails
    Quilfish is another rain sweeper that hits on the physical spectrum that synergizes with Ludicolo fantastically type-wise
    Kingdra is another rain sweeper that works well with Ludicolo, because they can wear down on each other's walls and help facilitate an easier sweep

Other Options
########

    A Special Tank set to soak up Water-type attacks and plain stop some special rain sweepers in their tracks is very useful, but is outclassed by Latias due to Ludicolo's lack of a good offensive presence, or Jellicent and Gastrodon because of their greater special bulk, better abilities that let them take no damage from Water-type attacks and reliable recovery in Recover
    A sub-seed set could work, but is outclassed in either speed, bulk, or power, as Ludicolo's stats make it have to choose one, when other users, like Celebi can be all three; sub-seed sets really struggle against Grass-types, which many are already Ludicolo's common switch-ins
    Drain Punch is another option of an energy-draining attack, but loses out on STAB and runs off of Ludicolo's weak attack stat, but can be used as a bait for the blobs, and maybe a tyranitar
    Swords Dance is it's best boosting option (don't even think about using Hone Claws or Power-Up Punch on this guy) and could make a rain-sweeper set out of it, but it is still way too weak and outclassed

Checks & Counters
########

    Talonflame puts a halt on all Ludicolo sets with a strong priority, super-effective Brave Bird/Acrobatics that will dismantle the sweeper set, although it has trouble switching in on Ludicolo's Water STAB
    Ferrothorn, Mega Abomasnow, and Assault Vest Tyranitar can easily wall all Ludicolo not using Focus Blast and two of them switch the weather also
    Prankster pokemon with Thunder Wave will end Ludicolo's sweeping
    Specially Defensive Ninetails does not take much damage from any of Ludicolo's moves when the sun is up, but must beware of Ludicolo predicting the switch and setting up another Rain Dance on the switch and hitting her hard with a Hydro Pump
    Grass types that have naturally high Special Defense, such as Celebi and Virizion, that can take an Ice Beam, can wall him hard, Mega Venusaur is noteworthy, because thanks to Thick Fat, it laughs at every hit Ludicolo throws at him
    Ludicolo can wall opposing Ludicolo, although they will usually be at a sort of stalemate, the defensive one might come out on top
    Very strong Special Walls, especially the Blobs and Goodra, eat up all of Ludicolo's attacks
