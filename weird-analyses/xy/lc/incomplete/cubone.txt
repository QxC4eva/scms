Overview
########
Cubone is a very potent physical sweeper and tank for one reason: its signature item, Thick Club. This item doubles its base 50 attack, allowing Cubone to smash entire teams if given the chance. Cubone's great coverage movepool gives it perfect coverage, and Rock Head permits it to spam Double-Edge with no recoil damage. Cubone's excellent base 95 Defense also gives it very good opportunities to switch in and shrug off a hit, and set up with a Swords Dance while the opponent switches. Of course, Cubone has drawbacks as well as assets. Its poor maximum 14 Speed due to an abysmal base 35 Speed puts it at risk of being revenge killed, and its awful Special Defense makes it very easy to take out with a special attack. Another issue s the ever-present Knock Off, which effectively renders Cubone useless by removing its item. Cubone is overall a very powerful offensive and defensive force physically, but needs to be wary of special threats and being revenge killed.

Moves
========
Earthquake is a mandatory STAB on this set, allowing Cubone to net super-effective damage on a number of threats and hit neutral foes with an effective 150 base power coming off a doubled base 50 Attack due to the Thick Club. Rock Slide and Fire Punch are both very good coverage options, allowing for powerful damage as well as super-effective hits. Knock Off is another excellent option, which hits Ghost- and Psychic-types for super-effective damage and removes enemy items. Double-Edge can be used in the final slot to net neutral damage on everything that resists Ground as well as not facing recoil due to Rock Head. It also offers almost perfect coverage on all of Ground's resists.
Set Details
========
This EV spread helps Cubone deal immense damage while taking hits just a little bit better than usual. The Speed boost allows it to outspeed other base 35s and base 40s with negative natures.
Thick Club is really the only reason Cubone is viable, and Cubone should never be used without it. Cubone misses its use of other items, such as the Berry Juice and the Eviolite, but Thick Club is just too powerful to pass up on any Cubone.

The Jolly nature assists Cubone in Speed at no cost to itself. Rock Head is used to prevent damage from Double-Edge, turning the move into a base 120 with no drawbacks. Cubone's other abilities are also helpful, and Battle Armor can also be used if Cubone is not carrying Double-Edge.
Usage Tips
========
Cubone benefits greatly from a Baton Pass chain, and especially needs help with Speed. A Jolly nature could be used with Sticky Web support from Surskit or Spinarak to achieve the same ends.
Cubone is a very powerful offensive Ground-type, and fills this niche on any team that needs it. Cubone can switch in to a number of common pokemon, including Magnemite and the many Rock-types.
Team Options
========
Cubone benefits greatly from being at the end of a Baton Pass chain, as it can make good use of stat boosts. The most pertinent stat for Cubone to boost is Speed, because its pitiful max 14 Speed makes it liable to being revenge killed. Agility and Flame Charge are both helpful moves to be Passed, as they both increase Speed and Flame Charge softens up the opponent for Cubone to sweep. A notable teammate is Torchic, who can guarantee a +2 to the stat of Cubone's choice and +1 to Speed because of Speed Boost and Torchic's excellent boosting movepool.

An offensive Ice-, Electric-, or Rock-type should be used to counter Flying-types, which are immune to Earthquake. Magnemite comes to mind, as does Voltorb to to its high Speed, which complements Cubone's poor Speed nicely. Specially defensive tanks and walls should be used to counter special attackers, who destroy Cubone. Anything with a resistance to Ice, Ground or Grass is welcome.

Another excellent teammate is Pawniard, who is capable of switching into Bronzor and Snover, two common checks for Cubone. It can also utilize Knock Off to eliminate Eviolites and Berry Juices to facilitate Cubone's sweep attempt.

Fletchling is another very cool teammate, landing a priority Tailwind and dying to allow Cubone to switch in for free, which can work effectively with Belly Drum. Cubone's Grass-type checks are also destroyed by Fletchling's Flying-type STAB.
Other Options
########
A physically defensive set could be attempted utilizing Cubone's great base 95 Defense, but Cubone is generally outclassed in this role. Rock Slide is useful to counter Flying-types, but its low base power is problematic. Rock Tomb could also be used as a Rock-type attack, and it comes with a definite Speed drop to the opponent, always useful. These moves are innacurate, however, and Cubone doesn't really have any moveslots to spare. Iron Head is another option instead of Play Rough, giving Cubone helpful coverage on the powerful new Fairy-types, as well as Cubone's Ice-type nemeses.

An EV spread of 196 HP / 196 Atk / 36 SpD / 76 Spe allows Cubone to reach a tremendous 22 Speed at +2 with Adamant, outspeeding the vast majority of the unboosted metagame. With Jolly, Cubone even outspeeds +1 Carvahna and Scarf Chinchou, hitting the former for a 2HKO and the latter for an OHKO. Speed also comes into play with a Trick Room sweeper set, as Cubone is one of very few physically effective LC TR sweepers.

There's not much else Cubone can do. Fire Punch is a coverage option, which notably hits Grass- and Bug-types with resistances to Ground. Bonemerang can nail Sturdy users, Substitutes, and Focus Sashes. Some sets can forfeit a boosting move for the opportunity to run two coverage moves, but this works exclusively with Baton Pass support.
Checks & Counters
########

**Misdreavus and other bulky Ghost-types**: These are hard counters to Cubone, and usually force it to switch out. A Dark-type should be used with Cubone solely to counter them.

**Bronzor**: Bronzor resists all of Cubone's common attacks save Knock Off and can deal great damage to it. It also can nail Cubone with Toxic and usually forces a switch.

**Flying-types and Levitate users, especially Poison-types**: Immune to Eartqhuake, Cubone's best attack, these wall Cubone to the point of being hard checks unless Cubone is carrying Rock Slide. Poison-types with Levitate and Zubat resist both Earthquake and Play Rough, and Gastly carries this even farther with immunity to Double-Edge.

**Knock Off**: Knock Off stops Cubone in its tracks by effectively halving its Attack. Unless Cubone has received an Agility Baton Pass, this generally happens before it can even attack due to its low Speed.

**Special vulnerability and lack of defensive items**: Cubone has very low special defense, which destroys it when it comes up against fast, powerful special attackers. It also needs Thick Club to be useful, which cuts away its use of Eviolite and Berry Juice.
