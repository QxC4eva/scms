<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder cannot be struck by critical hits.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>A pretty neat ability for bulky sweepers, but outside of that it is pretty worthless, since critical hits don't occur often enough to take advantage of it. Some Pokemon will use it though; <a href="/bw/pokemon/torterra">Torterra</a> will probably use it if you see it, since it will be more useful than <a href="/bw/abilities/overgrow">Overgrow</a>. <a href="/bw/pokemon/lapras">Lapras</a> could use it on a bulky set, but really <a href="/bw/abilities/hydration">Hydration</a> is always better due to <a href="/bw/abilities/drizzle">Drizzle</a> being everywhere. It's not a very good ability but it takes an element out of the game that annoys everyone.</p>
