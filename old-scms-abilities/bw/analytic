<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Any damaging attack other than <a href="/bw/moves/future_sight">Future Sight</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/doom_desire">Doom Desire</a> used by the wielder has its Base Power multiplied by 5325/4096 (about 130%) if it moves after its target. If the target switches out, the Analytic boost still applies.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In essence, Analytic is a <a href="/bw/items/life_orb">Life Orb</a> boost without recoil. Analytic is only available from the Dream World; however, all competitively viable users of it are released and available to use. It is a technically good ability; however, many of its users are too frail or too fast to use this ability effectively. That said, it has situational usage on <a href="/bw/pokemon/starmie">Starmie</a>'s Offensive Rapid Spin Set. Because that set can force switches, Analytic boosts Starmie's attacks against the switch-in, attaining 2HKOs it otherwise could not. On more defensive or Choice sets, however, Starmie's average 60 / 85 / 85 defenses and base 115 Speed make Analytic a poor choice over <a href="/bw/abilities/natural_cure">Natural Cure</a>. <a href="/bw/pokemon/magnezone">Magnezone</a>, however, is a much better candidate, as not only is it rather slow, but it also has high defenses and a huge base 130 Special Attack stat. Of course, using Analytic means forfeiting <a href="/bw/abilities/magnet_pull">Magnet Pull</a>, which gives Magnezone its great niche in the metagame. The loss of Magnet Pull would hurt Magnezone, so think carefully before slapping Analytic on, even though its power is pretty incredible if Magnezone also carries <a href="/bw/items/choice_specs">Choice Specs</a>. Lastly, the only other notable Pokemon to get Analytic are the <a href="/bw/pokemon/porygon">Porygon</a> family, and unfortunately they too have much better abilities to make use of. As a defensive Pokemon, <a href="/bw/pokemon/porygon2">Porygon2</a> would greatly prefer <a href="/bw/abilities/trace">Trace</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/porygon-z">Porygon-Z</a> has <a href="/bw/abilities/download">Download</a> and <a href="/bw/abilities/adaptability">Adaptability</a> to choose from already, not to mention that it isn't nearly bulky enough to be ripping through teams with Analytic.</p>
