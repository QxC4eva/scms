Overview
########
Lucario is a deadly offensive threat; in its mega evolved form, it sports 145/140 base offenses, with a very good 112 base speed. But perhaps most deadly of all, it has one of the best offensive abilities in the game: adaptability. Adaptability, combined with an excellent offensive movepool and deadly STABs, allows it to tear through any teams that are unprepared to handle it - so much so that its mega stone has been banned from OU. However, this Pokemon is far from perfect. It is fairly frail, being unable to take many hits, and such, it has difficulty coming into the battle, as well as staying in. Additionally, before its mega evolution, it has a lackluster 90 base speed - allowing it to be easily taken down before it can even act. Additionally, with the mega evolution, its offenses are rather subpar, with lower offenses and less useful abilities. As such, the mega stone is practically a necessity, meaning that the mega slot on your team will be taken up. Despite these weaknesses, Lucario can still be an extremely destructive offensive force if played well and to its strengths.

Moves
========
Lucario's power partly comes from its access to Close Combat - one of the deadliest offensive moves in the game. Coupled with its impressive offenses, as well as the Adaptability boost, it can easily OHKO or 2HKO almost anything that doesn't resist it, and still doing tons of damage to anything that does. Iron Tail, despite its fairly unreliable accuracy, is a necessity on Lucario's moveset - without it, it struggles to take out bulkier fairies, like Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas, even with bullet punch, also dealing major damage to ghost types that would be unaffected, as well as flying, psychic or bug types that would resist Close Combat. Bullet punch is Lucario's best bet for a priority move - again, it is adaptability boosted, allowing it to revenge important threats like a weakened Geomancy Xerneas, and finishing off any Pokemon that might outspeed it. The last slot is used for any extra coverage that Lucario may need. Stone Edge hits Ho-oh, OHKOing all but the most defensive of sets. Ice Punch hits Gliscor and Landorus-T for 4x effectiveness, both of which would otherwise resist Close Combat, as well as accurately hitting Pokemon like Giratina, Giratina-O, and Lugia for super effective damage. The last option, Swords Dance, boosts Lucario's offensive capabilities sky high, allowing it sweep and break walls much easier, even tearing through Pokemon that might resist its STABs.

Set Details
========
The EVs are simple - to maximize offensive power, as well as maximizing speed, as it is a glass cannon that cannot take many hits. Jolly is almost always preferred, as outspeeding all Pokemon is crucial, but Adamant is usable on teams with Sticky Web support. Keep in mind, however, you must beware of Yveltal, which is unaffected by Sticky Web, and outspeeds Adamant Lucario with max speed and a boosting nature. Finally, its item is its mega stone, Lucarionite, which is necessary for maximizing Lucario's otherwise lackluster speed and offensive power.

Usage Tips
========
- Use it to take out any walls that might trouble you, like Arceus-Fairy or Chansey
- Also a good late game cleaner when walls and threats have been taken out
- Get it out of situations where it will be outsped and killed (e.g. vs +1 Speed Blaziken), as it will fall to most decently powerful SE moves
- Also avoid situations where the enemy can survive and threaten a KO on you, or cripple you with burn or paralysis
- Good against Adamant Extreme Speed Arceus-Normal -- it is forced to either use a resisted ExtremeSpeed (at +2 it cannot KO a healthy lucario) or a slower non-priority coverage move, giving lucario the chance to outspeed and OHKO it
- Great for offensively pressuring defoggers - can deal massive damage to many of them while they defog
- Volt-Turn and (somewhat riskier) double switches help Lucario switch in safely - usually does not have too many opportunities to switch in on an attack


Team Options
========
- Sticky Web allows lucario to more comfortably outspeed everything (like Darkrai), giving it more of a chance to get KOs
- Web also allows it to check a variety of offensive threats, like ekiller, Xern, mega kanga, as well as offensively pressuring defoggers and doing significant damage to them if they choose to defog in front of it
- Web also allows it to run adamant over jolly, giving it even more offensive power.
- Cleric support is good for when you get burned or paralyzed, both of which greatly reduces Lucario's offensive power and longevity
- A good switch in for things that threaten it is helpful (e.g. Flying-types to switch into any Ground attacks aimed at it)
-Specifically, Yveltal can come in on Ground-types, threaten them offensively with a Dark Aura boosted Foul Play or Dark Pulse, as well as taking out Lugia/Giratina which would otherwise wall Lucario, whereas Lucario 4x resists Yveltal's Rock weakness, and offensively threatens fairies
- Arceus-Grass can also switch into Ground-types, threatening them out with a STAB and plate boosted Grass Knot, Judgment, or a burn, while also forcing out scarf Kyogre, which can outspeed and KO luke, while resisting Bullet Punch
- Giratina-O (and to a lesser extent, Giratina) can also take most fire/ground attacks aimed at lucario, while providing very good offensive pressure itself
- A u-turner/volt switcher helps to get lucario into the battle safely, which it might have trouble doing otherwise - it has difficulty switching in onto attacks due to its lack of bulk
- Keeping stealth rock up is useful so that ho-oh cannot switch in on you safely
- Gothitelle (and to a lesser extent, Wobbuffet) can trap and take out things that might give lucario some trouble (like bulky support arcs that can resist and WoW or KO)
- Screens support may be helpful for sets with swords dance, allowing lucario to survive more hits, giving it more opportunities to set up

Other Options
########
- Extreme Speed can be used over Bullet Punch as a priority move, does the same damage but hits different targets (e.g. BP can hit Mega Gengar, hits Fairy-types for SE damage, whereas Extreme Speed can be used to finish off weakened Water, Electric, and Fire-types without being resisted)
- A special set is also good (using moves like aura sphere, flash cannon, vacuum wave, nasty plot, etc.), but lacks the raw power of the physical set, which has moves that deal more damage (CC is 120 bp, vs aura sphere 90, iron tail 100 vs flash cannon 80)
- Crunch can be useful against Aegislash and is an accurate attack for other Ghost-types that can't be touched by Close Combat, but is difficult to fit in Lucario's already crowded moveset


Checks & Counters
########
- Bulky Arceus formes that aren't weak to fight/steel and that carry WoW can survive a hit and cripple Lucario, and then proceed to recover off the damage
- Giratina can take an Iron Tail and burn or phaze
- Lugia can take Iron Tail and Stone Edge, even when Multiscale is down, Roost off damage, and can phaze out
- Bulky Ground-types like Groudon and Landorus-T can survive hits and OHKO back
- Fast revenge killers that can outspeed and survive a Bullet Punch (Scarf Kyogre, Zekrom, Palkia, Blaziken, and Mega Mewtwo X). 
- If Stealth Rock is not up and not using Stone Edge, Ho-oh survives and OHKOs
- Aegislash is immune to Close Combatand resists steel moves, very difficult to do damage to it without a Dark move like Dark Pulse or Crunch
