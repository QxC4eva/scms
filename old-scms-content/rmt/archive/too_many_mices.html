<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I decided to make an NU team with really never used Pokémon with a touch of creativity—I looked for something never used even in the NU tier. And I mean something never used. This team had multiple victims, peaked on the ladder, and trolled a lot of people in general, so I decided that it'd be cool to post up an RMT. Well, I'm somewhat bored of this novelty team now, and people started to prepare with some niche sets (Lum Golem ==), making it not as effective. It still wins games consistently, but only if you play near-flawlessly. And that's only if they don't happen to carry a thing that flat-out 6-0's my team! So, round's almost up, and I decided to give this team a long overdue rest and retire it (if troll teams could ever be "retired" because that word just sounds so serious.)</p>

<p>You might say after the team preview, "Hey, so NU is a tier that noobs spam Pikachu, and beat other noobs that use Spinda?" Well, you may be right, but every ladder has their fair share of those people. On the other hand, I do feel that this 'everything is viable' idea makes NU so much more fun. There are so many things that are viable, but literally never used even in the NU tier: gems such as Vileplume and Fraxure were only recently able to show their worth in competitive NU, but proved to be incredibly good. And I'm sure there are more things that we've completely overlooked, but even better than some of the 'standards.' You should all try out NU sometime! But seriously, who reads these, especially for a troll team =/ Let's get to the team.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/76.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Golem</strong> @ Normal Gem<br />
Ability: Sturdy<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Rock Blast<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Explosion</p>

<p>Golem is one of my two dedicated leads with Butterfree. It's the obligatory Stealth Rock user—SR is just proven to be helpful on an offensive team like this. Otherwise, I will lose to randoms using focus sash on every member. Earthquake and Rock Blast is there for STAB, breaking sashes & substitutes, etc. Rock Blast comes especially helpful vs. Ninjasks and Baton Passing chains. Explosion is really surprising, and Golem can usually net a kill and SR every game. Golem's typing allows me to switch into Rotom-S (popular Gorebyss revenger) and Probopass / Regirock. (popular Rock-type) It fixes up the loose ends of my team. It will almost never lead, though. Jolly speed looks fishy, but I know it allows me to outspeed a lot of unexpected things.</p>

<p><strong>Pikachu</strong> @ Light Ball<br />
Ability: Static<br />
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Focus Punch<br />
- Grass Knot</p>

<p>Pikachu is the wrecking ball of the team. It is sadly walled by Grass-types, but Thunderbolt+ Grass Knot gives good enough for the most part. Focus Punch really rounds out the set, letting me hit Lickilicky, only 'true defensive counter' to Gorebyss. Most likely, they will just blindly switch in their special wall, get wrecked, and leave Gorebyss without a check. I do sometimes switch out Grass Knot to Hidden Power Ice, though, as I can't allow RP Torterra to set up. GK does do more damage to Regirock. If my execution with Gorebyss isn't up to par, GK is my crutch to finish it off. If I know I can play well with Gorebyss, I'll switch out GK for HP Ice on some days. Pika's static is there because Lightningrod is illegal with Focus Punch, but I love it! It paralyzes at the most gay times ever, and even if it's haxxy, it's a 30% chance of instant win! Too many people's gotten trolled by lol bs clutch Paralysis from Pikachu. Also, save this if you see Absol (which will be very often) so that you can sucker punch predict with Pikachu.</p>

<p><strong>Dodrio</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Early Bird<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Brave Bird<br />
- Return<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Drill Peck</p>

<p>Dodrio is perhaps the most unreliable member of the team. I needed something that could outspeed just about everything—even +2 Gorebyss—and Dodrio fits the bill perfectly. (pun intended) It can easily spam Brave Bird, and with only a few Steel-types available in NU, some teams are just way too vulnerable to Dodrio just sweeping off the remains. Brave Bird and Return is simple STAB, and Pursuit is somewhat of a utility against stuff like Cinccino who will 6-0 the team otherwise. Usually you'd Brave Bird on revenge, but this fails if they know you're scarfed and switch out. Pursuit allows me to play that mind game instead of simply getting 6-0'ed when the opponent has a Cinccino and knows my Dodrio is scarfed. Oh, and it can pursuit Grass/ Poison types in case Pika has trouble breaking through. However, Dodrio can be a setup bait, so please refrain from sending her out unless you need to revenge something fast (usually you won't need to revenge anything hopefully) or you see a clear sweep. Also, remember that Pursuit will kill your momentum, and you should use it only to pick off threats to the team such as Choice Scarf Jynx, Cinccino, etc only if you're sure that you can recover the loss of momentum.</p>

<p><strong>Raticate</strong> @ Toxic Orb<br />
Ability: Guts<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Facade<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- U-turn</p>

<p>Raticate is yet another Normal-type sweeper for my team. It really works well with Dodrio—they’re walled by just about the same things, but I have U-turn on Raticate to turn the tables on Regirock switch-ins by sending Pikachu/Gorebyss and threaten the kill. Because Gorebyss is so threatening, some are too scared to switch out, and Raticate will sweep! After the chip damages, hopefully something gets through opposing defense. He can usually OHKO stuff with SR support and boosted Facade, so that’s really cool, I guess. Sucker Punch is for strong priority and more prediction. In this kind of teams, if you can drag a skilled opponent down to prediction battles, sleep rolls, etc. stuff he doesn’t have 100% control over, then you’re doing what you’re supposed to do. </p>

<p>Its key advantage over Swellow & Ursaring is its U-turning ability—Swellow isn’t quite as good at it because it’s weak to SR. Raticate’s job is to make the Gorebyss vs. Rock-type matchups happen as much as possible, and it excels at it.</p>

<p><strong>Gorebyss</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Swift Swim<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Shell Smash<br />
- Surf<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Hidden Power Grass</p>

<p>They say "the Brokenmon of NU." I say Gorebyss. This is why the team works. Its primary job is to switch in after a Raticate U-turn into Regirock and Probopass. Usually, I just fire off a Surf or two, because I don’t want to get paralyzed for nothing. If I do set up, though, the other team is in big trouble. That’s why they have to risk their Rock-type to stay in for the paralysis. If I can predict them staying in, then Raticate and Dodrio will sweep. Its secondary job is to sweep in a moment's notice, in case they have multiple solid counters for Normal-types, and trying to wear all of them out is simply not viable. But now she's well prepared for, which is another reason my team is starting to see less success.</p>

<p><strong>Butterfree</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Coumpoundeyes<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 8 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Tailwind<br />
- Stun Spore</p>

<p>Butterfree is one of my two dedicated leads with Golem, but I usually see myself leading with Butterfree more often. Anything slower gets slept, and I can U-turn out for a favorable matchup. Butterfree is really what makes this team tick, because the sleep gives free turns that Pikachu and Gorebyss can both mercilessly abuse. Usually, leading with Butterfree shuts out most SR leads, which is somewhat helpful as I don’t have Spin Support. Sash is there for anything faster, and because of the sash, it’s one of the two things that actually can take a hit (other one being Golem thanks to its sturdy). 
</p>

<p>Stun Spore and Tailwind are mostly filler, but it can squeeze out momentum in a tight spot. Paralyze on the sash, and Tailwind as you die—boom, you just completely regained your momentum. Hell, even Golem can revenge +2 Gorebyss by that point. Stun Spore is also quite important for spreading the love known as parahax.</p>
