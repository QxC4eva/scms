<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of +1.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Though Aqua Jet has a fairly low Base Power, as with most priority moves it sees use in combination with Pokemon who get STAB on it in order to revenge kill Pokemon who are worn down or weak to it, or perhaps even to sweep in combination with a boosting move. Given the absurdly fast threats present in today's metagame, it is often best merely to bypass Speed altogether. With its Aqua Jet boosted by Drizzle, Choice Band and Huge Power, Azumarill can often clean up entire weakened teams despite its abysmal Speed, and sweepers such as Carracosta and Kabutops can, though more rarely, use Aqua Jet to take out faster Pokemon and other priority abusers after having used Shell Smash or Swords Dance. However, it should be remembered that Aqua Jet faces some competition as far as priority moves go; it is both weaker and of lower priority than ExtremeSpeed, and it has a poor distribution.</p>
