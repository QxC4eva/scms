Hits 2 times in one turn.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and always hits twice unless the target is KOed by the first hit. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate twice, and this move can KO through Focus Sash and Sturdy. If the first hit breaks a Substitute, the attack will continue to damage the target. Each hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. If the target holds a Chilan or Jaboca Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat both hits as a single attack, and Color Change will only activate on the second hit of the move.</p> 

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Double Hit is a move that hits twice on the same turn, and for that reason is good for breaking Substitutes; however, it still has fairly weak Base Power, so it is only a good option for Ambipom, who thanks to its Normal-type STAB and Technician ability can actually use it effectively to some extent. The 90% accuracy and the fact that dangerous Ghosts like Gengar and Mismagius often run Substitutes make it less appealing for a moveslot.</p>
