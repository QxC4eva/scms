Moves
========
- Protect and Leech Seed will help keep Ferrothorn healthy as well as harass opponents.
- Protect can be useful for scouting attacks that other Pokemon are using and help against Choice users.
- You can utilize Thunder Wave to harass potential switch-ins such as Charizard and Heatran.
- Gryo Ball can help Ferrothorn tackle threats thanks to its awesome defensive typing. Gyro Ball is good for catching Dragonite lacking Fire Punch, Deoxys-S, and many other fast Pokemon.
- Power Whip is a little more reliable thanks to its consistent 120 base power and full capability of stopping Mega Gyarados and Azumarill. Since Thunder Wave will often attract Rotom-W switch-ins Power Whip will also make Rotom-W think twice about switching into Ferrothorn again.
- Stealth Rock is the main entry hazard every team should use and Ferrothorn can easily provide.
- Spikes is a great move to utilize as the combination between Stealth Rock and Spikes can really harass opponents that lack Rapid Spin or Defog.
- Knock Off is a great attack to consider as the denial of Leftovers and extra health lost from Leech Seed can quickly drain opponents of their health.
- Iron Head works well in tandem with Thunder Wave to lock down opponents and obtain extra health from Leech Seed. Make sure to use an Impish nature with Speed IVs.

Set Details
========
- Near-max HP and max Def with a Relaxed nature helps Ferrothorn tackle many physical threats such as Mega Gyarados, Tyranitar lacking Fire Blast, and Deoxys-S lacking Hidden Power Fire. Relaxed boosts Gyro Ball's base power significantly against faster threats such as said Deoxys-S.
- 0 Speed IV is also necessary with Relaxed nature to boost Gyro Ball.
- If Gyro Ball is absent Impish with 31 Speed IV is fine.
- Leftovers is the preferred item as it helps keep Ferrothorn in tip-top shape to continue taking on possible threats. Leftovers and Protect guarantee that Ferrothorn will at least recover 6% of its health and possibly more with Leech Seed.
- As Protect and Leech Seed can keep Ferrothorn healthy, Rocky Helmet can be used to further harass contact users such as Conkeldurr and Scizor.

Usage Tips
========
- Ferrothorn is often used as a Pokemon that lays entry hazards and proceeds to utilize Leech Seed to heal itself and its teammates while wearing out the enemy teammates and forcing switches.
- Since Protect is used on this set it can sometimes be fairly predictable to use. For example, Protect can often grant a near-free switch-in to another Pokemon. In response, try to predict the switch-in by using Leech Seed instead of Protect.
- Gyro Ball is necessary for Dragonite and other fast sweepers such as Mega Pinsir. If you're in dire need of a Mega Gyarados counter while still using Stealth Rock or Spikes you can opt to drop Gyro Ball for Power Whip.
- Though at times it may be risky sending in Ferrothorn on a Pokemon that will use U-turn will also reap its benefits as Iron Barbs will hurt the opposing U-turner. You can add more passive damage with Rocky Helmet.
- Be careful of Scald and Will-O-Wisp. Ferrothorn does not appreciate burns whatsoever as its Attack is halved and the passive damage wears Ferrothorn down; especially those that opt to use Rocky Helmet.
- Utilizing Leech Seed and Thunder Wave can create many switches, so be sure to keep Stealth Rock down at all times possible!

Team Options
========
- Ferrothorn is a Pokemon that usually supports teammates and doesn't necessarily require massive support around it.
- Hippowdon is a cool teammate as it can stop either Mega Charizard formes while shutting them down with either STAB Earthquake or Rock Slide. Hippowdon can supplement Stealth Rock so Ferrothorn can utilize Power Whip or Spikes.
- As Ferrothorn is a tank of sorts it does lack recovery. Chansey can pass Wish and heal with Aromatherapy if necessary while easily preventing Mega Charizard Y from doing anything to Ferrothorn.
- Though Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr do not enjoy taking damage from Iron Barbs, Leech Seed, or possibly Rocky Helmet, they are still a problem for Ferrothorn. Clefable and Sylveon are great teammates that can support Ferrothorn with Wish and / or Heal Bell while shutting down the majority of Fighting-types with STAB Moonblast or Hyper Voice, respectively.
- Thunder Wave will often lure in Electric-types. You can use Hippowdon or Unaware Quagsire to take on these threats easily. Alternatively, Tyranitar can shut out some Electric-types, barring Thundurus-I with Focus Blast, with its monstrous Special Defense.
- Without Gyro Ball Ferrothorn has a harder time checking threats such as Dragonite and Mega Pinsir; however, Thunder Wave will at least help by slowing these threats down. Having teammates such as Zapdos or Unaware Clefable can help Ferrothorn and its team out.
- Since Ferrothorn is commonly used to lay entry hazards it can attract Rapid Spin and Defog users. Though it is difficult to stop Excadrill from using Rapid Spin due to the lack of reliable Ghost-types that can take a STAB Mold Breaker Earthquake, you can take advantage of Defog users with Pokemon such as Defiant Bisharp who receives a +2 Attack boost.

Other Options
########
- Bulldoze will deter Heatran switch-ins as well as the rare Magnezone.
- Toxic can be used to wear down some of Ferrothorn's switch-ins; however, most of Ferrothorn's switch-ins consist of Steel-types or Hidden Power Fire Mega Venusaur.
- Curse exists to further boost Ferrothorn's Attack and Defense. Without any access to reliable recovery as well as having poor STABs to utilize a mono-attacker, it is difficult to make use of Curse Ferrothorn without massive support.
- Ferrothorn has just enough moves to use Choice Band, but it is really a poor way to use Ferrothorn.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Ferrothorn's STABs are easily resisted by Fire-types such as Heatran, Volcarona, Talonflame, and Charizard. Both of these Pokemon can switch into the majority of Ferrothorn's attacks and leave Ferrothorn singed from their STAB Fire-type attacks. Though rare, Entei has an added benefit of its STAB Sacred Fire not being prone to Iron Barbs damage. Talonflame and Mega Charizard X must be weary as their STAB Fire-type moves are contact moves and, thus, take passive damage from Iron Barbs and possibly from Rocky Helmet.

**Physical Walls**: Like most Pokemon that don't invest into their Attack Ferrothorn is a Pokemon that is easy to wall for some physical walls. Skarmory takes no damage whatsoever while possibly utilizing its own Rocky Helmet to damage Ferrothorn if it uses Gyro Ball or Power Whip. Defog can eliminate Stealth Rock or Spikes too while Skarmory sets up its own. Zapdos can also utilize Defog and, as an added bonus, use Heat Wave to make sure Ferrothorn leaves the scene quietly. Mandibuzz can use Taunt to completely shut down Ferrothorn. Mega Venusaur needs Hidden Power Fire but it can easily switch into any attack Ferrothorn uses and, in most cases, scare it off since Ferrothorn cannot do anything back to Mega Venusaur.

**Fighting-types**: Though Fighting-types may have an awkward time switching into Ferrothorn and the majority hate taking Iron Barbs passive damage they are easily capable of scaring Ferrothorn off. Though Conkeldurr will take a lot of damage in the process from Iron Barbs it can restore its health with STAB Drain Punch. Lucario easily resists both of Ferrothorn's STABs to let it freely set up a Swords Dance.

**Taunt**: Ferrothorn is shut down hard by Taunt users as its STABs are rather easy to wall. As stated before Mandibuzz can easily use Taunt as well as other Pokemon including Heatran, Talonflame, and Thundurus-I. Deoxys-D can easily Taunt Ferrothorn and then proceed to set up its own entry hazards.

**Liquid Ooze**: Only one Pokemon, Tentacruel, is really noteworthy as it can use Liquid Ooze to force Ferrothorn and its teammates to take damage when Tentacruel is seeded.
