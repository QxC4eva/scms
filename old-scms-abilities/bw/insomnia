<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder cannot be put to sleep or be rendered drowsy via <a href="/bw/moves/yawn">Yawn</a>. <a href="/bw/moves/rest">Rest</a> will fail when used by this Pokemon. If the wielder is sleeping, it is instantly cured of sleep. A Pokemon with <a href="/bw/abilities/mold_breaker">Mold Breaker</a> can target the wielder with Yawn and make it drowsy, but the wielder will fail to fall asleep (unless it no longer has Insomnia the next turn).</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Like <a href="/bw/abilities/vital_spirit">Vital Spirit</a>, Insomnia grants the wielder the ability to switch into sleep-inducing moves fearlessly. <a href="/bw/pokemon/banette">Banette</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/honchkrow">Honchkrow</a> can take advantage of this fact to switch in and fire off powerful attacks, and the former can also <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> its own Insomnia to screw over Rest users. <a href="/bw/pokemon/noctowl">Noctowl</a> can become virtually immune to status with <a href="/bw/moves/psycho_shift">Psycho Shift</a> in hand, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/hypno">Hypno</a> can wall special assaults all day long without fearing <a href="/bw/moves/hypnosis">Hypnosis</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/sleep_powder">Sleep Powder</a> putting it to an early sleep.</p>
