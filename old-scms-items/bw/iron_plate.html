<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that increases the Base Power of all Steel-type moves by 20%. When held by a Pokemon with the Multitype ability, the holder's type will change to Steel.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In a tier where Dragon-type attacks are slung around by nearly everything, Steel Arceus stands out as the sturdiest Steel-type in the game. It can take hits from nearly anything with its enormous set of resistances, including a valuable resistance to Dragon-type moves, and is an excellent wall and stallbreaker thanks to its resistance to Stealth Rock and immunity to Toxic. It is generally used as a Calm Mind sweeper and shuffler with Roar, but it can also use a decent Swords Dance set or take on a supporting role.</p>

<p>Iron Plate is also useful for Scizor, as it boosts the power of Bullet Punch, its main sweeping attack, without the recoil damage of Life Orb. This affords the Steel / Bug type Pokemon a solid power boost while still being able to switch in many times if needed, as well as enabling it to bluff a Choice Band set against less observant opponents.</p>

<h2>Location</h2> 
<p>Abyssal Ruins, 1F.</p>
