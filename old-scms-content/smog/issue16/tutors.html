<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>A new generation with a collection of new Pokemon is always a reason to celebrate. As the metagame has unfolded and hidden abilities revealed, an unlimited amount of speculation has occurred. We all know  more abilities are on the way, the entirety of the fifth generation is  without their hidden abilities.</p>

<p>Still, Black and White leave something missing. A Gray area, if you will. Moves that are staple in previous generations are missing on 5th Generation Pokemon, and while Game Freak and Nintendo seem to be  focusing on allowing more and more event Pokemon to shape the metagame, we can't help but feel a void on some of our new favorites.</p>

<p>So here I am, your master of speculation to toss you into throes of madness with tutor predictions. Everything from the mundane to the extreme will be covered, so please sit back and enjoy.</p>

<h2>The Naturals:</h2>

<p>Some Tutor Moves are such obvious candidates that it's better  to list them here. These are the kind of moves with huge distribution  but generally mediocre performance.</p>

<h3>Sleep Talk:</h3>

<p>We'll start with the best move first. The changes in sleep  mechanics are a mixed blessing in that it can allow a few unique strategies to flourish if you can get a lucky sleep roll. RestTalking is  still less powerful because you are locked in a two turn sleep, but at the same time, it can be exploited.</p>

<h4>New Threats:</h4>

<p>Most of the new Pokemon aren't sterling defensive candidates,  but Sleep Talk can help them implement their strategies a little more effectively.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/628.png" alt="" />

<p>Ferrothorn stands out as a Pokemon with excellent defenses that  could use Sleep Talk to spread more hazards while asleep, and use the  healing to further exploit Rocky Helmet + Iron Barbs. A lack of healing  has always been Ferrothorn's primary problem, and while Rest isn't really "reliable," it allows Ferrothorn to remain a threat while asleep.  The set is most likely to be Rest / Sleep Talk / Spikes with either  Power Whip or Gyro Ball to round it out.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/624.png" alt="" />

<p>Alomomola will prove potent with Rest / Sleep Talk / Calm Mind /  Scald, as it will now be able to exploit its bulk outside of Rain.  Although the number of Pokemon with Water-immune abilities has increased, there's no denying Alomomola will slowly grind down opponents. If Regenerator is released with it, it will also be nearly impossible to take it down before it can attempt to Rest again.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/525.png" alt="" />

<p>Serperior isn't that bulky, but it does have a unique niche  that will make the regenerative ability of Rest + Sleep Talk valuable.  With Rest / Sleep Talk / Leaf Storm / Dragon Tail on a Serperior with  Contrary, Serperior's Speed and special attacking prowess can increase or it can phaze the opponent away and do hazard damage. Either way, if  it can be powered up properly beforehand, it can be quite a threat even  while Resting.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/566.png" alt="" />

<p>Throh is another bulky Pokemon that has useful Phazing  applications. Rest / Sleep Talk / Bulk Up / Circle Throw may be weak, but it's an excellent way to spread hazard damage. Throh increases its offensive potential further with Guts, and Sleep Talk allows Circle Throw to bypass its priority drawback.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/597.png" alt="" />

<p>Archeops is perhaps the most interesting potential user. If it  survives a slower opponent's attack and uses Rest it then has a 50%  chance of using another brutal full-powered attack. A set consisting of  Rest / Sleep Talk / Dragon Tail / Head Smash has the potential to be  very aggravating, especially when Archeops is faster, as any selection  of Dragon Tail does excellent damage and forces the enemy out, while  Head Smash at full power can obliterate an opponent. Alternative attacks  could be Acrobatics, Rock Slide, or Stone Edge.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/130.png" alt="" />

<p>Rest + Sleep Talk Gyarados gets a lot of leverage with  Intimidate, but Moxie offers a different kind of threat. Gyarados is no  slouch on offense, and a single attack boost combined with the longevity  offered by Rest + Sleep Talk can make Gyarados a very difficult threat  to address. Moxie also somewhat reduces the need for Dragon Dance,  allowing Gyarados to phaze with Dragon Tail and have a way to handle  threats with a Water immunity.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/378.png" alt="" />

<p>Clear Body is decent if you care about Intimidate. If you  don't, then like Regice, you'd prefer to use Rest + Sleep Talk with Ice  Body, which greatly increases your healing factor in Hail. This isn't  released yet either, but the way things are looking in OU, Permanent  Hail will be the last Permaweather standing.</p>

<h3>Captivate:</h3>

<p>Always was situational, always will be. That being said, Thundurus is always Male, and Captivate gives any faster Pokemon a way to  either counteract Nasty Plot or neuter it entirely.</p>

<h3>Endure:</h3>

<p>It's been a long time since berry boosts with Flail or Reversal  were relevant, and with the metagame faster than ever, Endure-based  strategies simply aren't viable. Maybe if we were back in  ADV...</p>

<h3>Natural Gift:</h3>

<p>Lets face it, Berries have even more competition for item slots these days, this isn't going anywhere.</p>

<h3>Secret Power:</h3>

<p>A 70 BP Normal attack with an effect chance? Not going anywhere either, sadly.</p>

<h2>A Common History:</h2>

<p>Some Tutor Moves have such a storied history that to expect  them is obvious. The only question comes down to distribution. Here's  where the fun begins.</p>

<h3>Fire Punch:</h3>

<p>Fire Punch is a basic coverage attack lacking from many of the  Pokemon in Black and White. There are more than a few of them that would  love this Steel-killing addition to their arsenal.</p>

<h4>New Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/642.png" alt="" />

<p>Quite possibly the easiest pick ever. With Mold Breaker and  Fire Punch, Nothing will be able to switch into Haxorus' Dragon + Fire  attack coverage without taking massive damage. Heatran didn't really  want to switch in before with Earthquake looming. With Fire Punch to  slaughter Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Scizor, and the odd Durant or  Escavalier, Haxorus greatly increases its threat level. It even OHKOes  Forretress through Sturdy! Druddigon also benefits from this with Life  Orb and Sheer Force, but as Druddigon is kind of like a Haxorus only  usable in Trick Room, Haxorus will always be the bigger  threat.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/675.png" alt="" />

<p>Landorus pines for an effective way to break through floating  Steel types and Ferrothorn, and Fire Punch delivers on that. As powerful  as Sand Force boosted Stone Edge is, it still has accuracy issues that  are difficult to deal with. Furthermore, if Sheer Force is released,  Fire Punch's value becomes even more obvious. Fire Punch also hits the  vast majority of Rock / Ground resistances for super effective damage,  and most of the Steel-types using Air Balloon are very vulnerable to the  attack.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/562.png" alt="" />

<p>Conkeldurr benefits from Fire Punch in so many ways. Not only  does it give a potential reason for using Sheer Force over Guts, but the  combination of Conkeldurr's bulk, Bulk Up, and Life Orb along with  Sheer Force-boosted attacks is truly frightening. Lack of coverage is  Conkeldurr's only real problem, and Fire Punch gives it an easy answer  to Skarmory, Forretress, and Celebi. It's kind of sad that Conkeldurr  sucks up basically every niche to which Hariyama could aspire.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/395.png" alt="" />

<p>Infernape picks up Iron Fist, but the way Nintendo's events  have been going, they tend to release only male starters. Fire Punch  gives Infernape a physical STAB it can use with Iron Fist which, unlike  Flare Blitz, won't eat away gobs and gobs of Infernape's HP. A Fire  Punch tutor patches that up nicely, and gives Infernape a way to keep  its physical threat level up.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/412.png" alt="" />

<p>Rampardos gets Sheer Force as a Hidden Ability, and in the case  of Fire Punch cements Rampardos as a glass cannon par excellence. Life  Orb Sheer Force attacks make Rampardos even more threatening than it  already was, and Rampardos has no shortage of relevant physical attack  diversity to combine with its absurd Attack stat. Rock Slide + Fire  Punch has excellent super effective coverage.</p>

<h3>ThunderPunch:</h3>

<p>ThunderPunch is another basic coverage move lacking from many  Black and White Pokemon. Where Fire Punch destroys Steel-types, ThunderPunch crushes bulky Water-types.</p>

<h4>New Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/584.png" alt="" />

<p>Darmanitan appears to be paying homage to the original  "Fire-type syndrome" of RBY. Drastically outsized Attack and mediocre  (terrible in Darmanitan's case) Special Attack. Well, ThunderPunch gives  Darmanitan a coverage attack that completely obliterates any Water-type  counters, bar those immune to Electric. Sheer Force ThunderPunch can  2HKO even through a Max/Max Slowbro w/ Leftovers. Absolutely  brutal.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/562.png" alt="" />

<p>ThunderPunch is another excellent coverage attack for  Conkeldurr. Though it competes with Stone Edge on a Guts set, with Sheer  Force, ThunderPunch hits amazingly hard and easily coasts through  Gyarados, Slowbro (same power as Darmanitan lol), and Jellicent.  ThunderPunch is even super effective against Skarmory, who has to play  the dangerous game of ThunderPunch vs. Drain Punch on a Roost.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/672.png" alt="" />

<p>Thunderbro uses ThunderPunch as a way to enable use of its 115  Base Attack with a non-suicidal STAB. Not only that, but with a Hidden  Ability of Defiant, Thundurus might even be scarier as a physical threat  with the right coverage. Wild Charge may have low recoil, but where its  best targets have high HP, ThunderPunch could be a better option.  Eelektross can use ThunderPunch in a similar manner, though it's not as  generally threatening as Thundurus.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/412.png" alt="" />

<p>Rampardos is back and for the same reason. ThunderPunch is  probably more relevant as a Sheer Force boosted attack than Fire Punch  for the sheer fact it defeats the bulky waters that plague Rampardos.  Rock Slide can't quite punch through them, but ThunderPunch can, and all  without Life Orb recoil.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/34.png" alt="" />

<p>Nidoking benefits from elemental punches in general, and since  Thunder can't really replace ThunderPunch and Thunderbolt is mostly  comparable, having the option just lets Nidoking mix up its attacks  more, and catch different Pokemon off guard. All of the punches combine  better with Hone Claws and Sucker Punch, and allow Nidoking to be  customized to its teams needs.</p>

<h3>Ice Punch:</h3>

<p>The final infamous elemental punch, and the most common  combination attack with ThunderPunch for the "BoltBeam" attack  combination. Ice Punch's coverage alone is excellent, but when combined,  it becomes truly frightening.</p>

<h4>New Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/676.png" alt="" />

<p>Physical STAB. How sweet it is. Kyurem's problem is that while  Dragon STAB is good, Ice STAB is often more relevant. While Dragon STAB  can't cut through Landorus, Celebi, and Gliscor, Ice STAB can. Ice Punch  will be especially helpful if Kyurem also gains ThunderPunch, a  possibility not explored above. Coverage moves are only helpful if they  can combine offensive synergy with a STAB or with each other. Now it's  true Kyurem's arms are a bit stubby, but at least it isn't a floating  ball of gas. Why, such a thing would never get punches. Ha ha  ha.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/562.png" alt="" />

<p>You didn't really think Conkeldurr would miss out on this, did  you? Ice Punch gives Conkeldurr the ability to slay the nasty Dragons  that try to stop its sweep. In addition it prevents Landorus from coming  in, as well as allowing it to beat Gliscor. Celebi is another  convenient target for Ice Punch. Ice Punch, of course, gets the same  Sheer Force benefits as its brethren, and any combination of the three  with Drain Punch and Bulk Up is truly fearsome on the right team.  Elemental punches will become Conkeldurr's bread and butter. It already  had a good run when Excadrill was all the rage, so expect a  comeback.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/634.png" alt="" />

<p>While this could apply equally well to Thundurus, Eelektross  gets top billing here because it would greatly increase its ability to  cover threats, give it a new coverage type, and Eelektross would not be  weak to it at the same time. Coil, along with Ice Punch and Dragon Tail,  should make Eelektross a formidable stat-raising Pokemon with the  ability to phaze out other threats. The accuracy boost might be  unwarranted now with Garchomp gone, but beforehand it would allow it to  deal with Sand Veil as well.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/655.png" alt="" />

<p>Bisharp is one of those Steel types that can't really  capitalize on its Dragon resistance and serviceable Defense because it  lacks an effective way to hit Dragons. Ice Punch patches that up. While  it's excellent alone, combined with ThunderPunch it allows Bisharp to  take on the two most threatening Pokemon with Intimidate, Salamence and  Gyarados. Defiant complements the coverage very well, and in a set of  Swords Dance / Sucker Punch / Brick Break /Ice Punch, Bisharp will have  an excellent range of coverage with priority.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/34.png" alt="" />

<p>Ice has the best coverage and often the most relevant targets.  Again, the elemental punches added back into Nidoking's movepool simply  allow it more versatility. Sheer Force is too amazing not to explore all  options. Blizzard is the same as Thunder when it comes to reliability,  and as before, Ice Beam is merely comparable to Ice Punch.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/160.png" alt="" />

<p>What a surprise, another Sheer Force user! Given Game Freak's  tendency to only release male starters, Feraligatr would prefer to have a  stronger, more accurate boosted Ice-type attack. Ice Fang only goes so  far, and the questionable accuracy does it no favors. In any case,  having it as a breeding move might not be enough, so a tutor is the best  way to get that critical Water + Ice coverage.</p>

<h2>I've Seen These G4:</h2>

<p>Here are a few TM and tutor selections that came from the last  generation that had massive effects on the metagame.</p>

<h3>Superpower:</h3>

<p>As flawed a move as Superpower is, it had a good run in the 4th  Gen on Pokemon that switched in and out often, a staple of Choice Band  and Choice Scarf Pokemon who needed a single fast, powerful  Fighting-type hit.</p>

<h4>New Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/619.png" alt="" />

<p>Escavalier is somewhat like the second coming of Scizor. It has  a lot of resistances, good bulk, and hits like a truck. No U-turn makes  it different in function, but more often than not, Scizor needs to be  able to choose its attacks on a turn-by-turn basis. Truly, Escavalier's  only wish in the world is for a decent Fighting-type attack. Superpower  fits the bill, allowing it to smash through the Steel types that resist  Megahorn. That just leaves Ghost-types, all of which take decent damage  from Iron Head.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/676.png" alt="" />

<p>Kyurem is a Pokemon with a great Attack stat that simply goes  unused for a lack of moves to use it. Ice Punch, as mentioned above,  helps with STAB, Superpower gives it Ice / Fighting coverage with decent  power, and just makes it easier to go mixed. So many top threats are  vulnerable to the combination that it's almost a no-brainer, just don't  sling it around too wildly.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/597.png" alt="" />

<p>Archeops defines "fast, powerful attacker." Ground / Rock /  Flying is pretty good coverage, but Archeops could use more powerful and  simultaneously accurate attacks. It'd give it something to bash  Ferrothorn's face with, and combined with Fighting Gem, would give it  and Acrobatics good synergy. Since Superpower tends to be handed to  anything with 110 Base Attack or more, call this one likely. If you  don't you're just a Defeatist.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/642.png" alt="" />

<p>Probably not as useful as Fire Punch because of the stat drop,  but hell if Haxorus wouldn't enjoy bashing something's head in with a  120 Base Power, no-drawback (first use anyway) move. When Brick Break  just doesn't do the job for you, break glass for Superpower. Hydreigon  also likes this, although its a far better Scarfer than Bander with  U-turn in its movepool.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/631.png" alt="" />

<p>What if you had 100 Base Attack, a +1 Atk / +2 Spe booster, and  no physical movepool? Well, then you'd really want Superpower, because  hell, you didn't get much else. I hope Game Freak has mercy on our Giga  Gear here, because so far they've trolled it so very, very hard. At  least with Superpower, Shift Gear, and Gear Grind, it could make an  attempt at attacking.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/478.png" alt="" />

<p>Mamoswine also got trolled hard when it's Thick Fat variant was  released. Basically, all of its good attacks were taken out. Giving it  Superpower back will fix that problem somewhat, and while it won't have  anything better than Ice Fang or Icicle Spear, at least it will be able  to smack all of the Air Balloon carrying Steels down once again. Now if  we can just get it Ice Shard...</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/435.png" alt="" />

<p>Honchkrow is in the same boat as Mamoswine. You get a great new  ability, except it guts your best coverage attack. That's not a great  statement to make, but the fact a KO with Superpower negates the Attack  drop with Moxie makes it an excellent comeback tutor for Don Karasu.  There'll be a mob to get it.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/136.png" alt="" />

<p>So you finally get a good ability, and they take away your best  coverage attack. Well, no more! Flareon probably still won't rise to  the top, but at least with a Toxic Orb in UU it'll be able to do some  real damage. Game Freak hates Flareon though, so it's almost guaranteed  not to be released now that I've speculated about it. What a  ripoff.</p>

<h3>Sucker Punch:</h3>

<p>While the move also has flaws akin to Superpower, there's no  denying that even a chance to have a physical 80 Base Power priority  move, conditional or otherwise, is an opportunity many Pokemon can  pounce on. Sucker Punch isn't a reliable STAB and as a coverage option  it's sketchy, but used properly it can be a very effective  weapon.</p>

<h4>New Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/590.png" alt="" />

<p>Scrafty has cool abilities and a unique, fairly decent typing  to go with it. The only stat it is truly lacking in is Speed, and Sucker  Punch gives it a STAB attack to use when Dragon Dance simply doesn't  lift it high enough. With Moxie it becomes even more dangerous, turning  Scrafty into an unpredictable and powerful threat.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/582.png" alt="" />

<p>Krookodile is in a similar boat to Scrafty, having decent  Attack power but a questionable Speed tier. While it's not as bad as  Scrafty, the fact remains that Krookodile can't boost its speed, so all  it has is Swords Dance. A STAB, Swords Dance boosted Sucker Punch is a  formidable threat indeed, and Krookodile can either keep the boosts  coming with Moxie or weaken the foe when it comes in with Intimidate.  Either way, it gives Krookodile a method to raise its offensive profile  effectively.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/642.png" alt="" />

<p>Scary crazy Base Attack? Check. Swords Dance / Dragon Dance?  Check. Stupidly powerful existing coverage in two moves? Check. Haxorus  has both the space and the means for using Sucker Punch effectively, and  would like nothing more than to rip Latias and Trick Room Reuniclus  variants to shreds, in addition to getting a jump on Mamoswine.  Requiring your Haxorus check to be able to survive a +1 or +2 Life Orb  Sucker Punch just to get their attack in will not be a fun  prospect.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/662.png" alt="" />

<p>So you have a niche as one of the few Pokemon with the  inclination to use Hone Claws, your ability is Hustle, and one of your  defenses is suspect while the other is crap? Sucker Punch may be a good  option for you. Sucker Punch hits the same things as Crunch, but has the  added benefit of getting the jump on a lot of faster threats,  especially those pesky opponents hovering at 110 Base Speed. Durant just  isn't the kind of Pokemon opponents want to play guessing games  with.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/665.png" alt="" />

<p>Even with Work Up and Hone Claws as your only boosting attacks,  STAB Sucker Punch can go a long way when you find yourself in the  ridiculous speed tier of 98. Too slow to catch Base 100s, too fast to do  anything useful in say, Trick Room. The ability to catch several faster  Pokemon off guard is invaluable to Hydreigon, a Pokemon with no lack of  offensive prowess.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/554.png" alt="" />

<p>Gigalith has a good case as a pure-rock counterpart to Golem  for access to Sucker Punch, and with 135 Base Attack, it isn't lacking  for power. Given how truly terrible pure Rock is as a defensive type,  Gigalith's Sturdy doesn't go as far as you think it would. It goes far  enough, however, as it can allow Gigalith two attacks from full health.  Moreover, Gigalith doesn't exactly suffer from 4MSS, it's pretty bread  and butter with Stone Edge / Earthquake / Stealth Rock / Explosion as  its set now. Getting SR or Explosion to move over shouldn't be  difficult.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/106.png" alt="" />

<p>Hitmonlee comes back with Unburden as a Dream World ability,  and with a Dark Gem Sucker Punch, could do some serious damage and give  Hitmonlee the Speed boost. In any case, if Unburden Hitmonlee has any  useful applications, Sucker Punch will serve it well.</p>

<h3>Heat Wave:</h3>

<p>Heat Wave was notable for being an inaccurate variant of  Flamethrower, but 90% was not bad, and the key to Heat Wave's success as  a tutor was what it did for its recipients. Well, nothing has changed,  and Heat Wave can still have another good run.</p>

<h4>New Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/671.png" alt="" />

<p>Tornadus got its claim to fame in the Rain, but it's just as  weak to Thunder as anything else. While it can't get the best of both  worlds weather-wise, Heat Wave gives Tornadus some excellent special  coverage, and unlike Thundurus, it doesn't really have anything  competing for a moveslot. The ability to swap in Air Slash on a Sunny  Day team and use Hammer Arm to address Tyranitar like its Thunderbro,  Heat Wave should give Tornadus a new day in the sun.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/591.png" alt="" />

<p>Sigilyph currently has nothing for Steel-types that switch in  on it, but Heat Wave fixes that in a single move. While its Magic  Guard-related tricks will probably still be its best set, the addition  of a decent coverage move won't hurt more offense oriented sets. After  all, there's nothing to be lost from a Life Orb boosted Heat  Wave.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/145.png" alt="" />

<p>So what was Zapdos's worst dilemma if it got Lightningrod? It'd  switch that sweet, sweet Electric immunity for a lack of Heat Wave to  help its coverage. Not a problem with a Heat Wave Tutor. The one move  that made Zapdos truly frightening is back, and with an ability that can  raise its Special Attack if played properly, it will only get more  menacing.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/178.png" alt="" />

<p>So you can bounce back Taunt, Toxic, Thunder Wave, and hazards.  But you can't hit Steel types? Worry no longer, because Heat Wave can  give you a reprieve. Xatu will probably never be among the upper  echelons of Pokemon, but at least Heat Wave greatly increases its threat  level to a lot of the Steel types that carry Stealth Rock.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/435.png" alt="" />

<p>It's got a lot of Moxie to show its face around here. With a  decent Special Attack to take care of Steel-types, Honchkrow can use its  new ability to increase its mixed threat potential. Fire coverage is  really key in dealing with a lot of the new Steels, and Heat Wave tends  to hit the weaker defense of a lot of Pokemon weak to it.</p>

<h3>Iron Head:</h3>

<p>What? A Steel-type tutor being noteworthy? Well, as a move Iron  Head isn't that bad. 100 Accuracy and a 30% chance to flinch with 80  Base Power is nothing to balk at, and as bad as Steel STAB is, it has  several applications.</p>

<h4>New Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/558.png" alt="" />

<p>And you thought Rock Slide was annoying? Rock Slide can flinch,  but so can Iron Head, and Iron Head doesn't have any accuracy issues.  Excadrill's Iron Head also hits harder than Frustration on Pokemon that  don't resist either attack, and it gives Excadrill a credible Steel STAB  to use with Sand Force - an Adamant Choice Scarf set will still hit  well above 400 Speed. Say, wasn't it a 20% chance not to be able to hit  an insanely powerful, fast Swords Dancer that got Garchomp banned? I  wonder...</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/631.png" alt="" />

<p>So what if you had 100 Base Attack... oh, I already said that.  Shift Gear + Iron Head would be one of the most annoying combinations  ever created. I'm not sure how effective it would be, but given that  Jolly, max Spe Klinklang after a Shift Gear boost outspeeds Sand Rush  Excadrill, I'd say it'd be good for at least knocking off some Air  Balloons, and maybe if Klinklang is a good inorganic automaton,  following up with Superpower. Hope for Christmas in July.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/208.png" alt="" />

<p>A pipe dream for me I'm sure, but as long as you have Sheer  Force, why not go for a STAB where you'll clearly get no benefit from  flinch anyway? Steelix actually has a fairly expansive Sheer Force  applicable movepool, its just it has trouble shining with such little  Speed and mediocre power. I can always dream of a place where Steelix is  a hazardous monstrosity.</p>

<h3>Roost:</h3>

<p>Remember when Skarmory didn't have reliable recovery and  couldn't play games with slower Stone Edges? Me neither. Roost has to be  one of the greatest single attacks ever created, and its mind-game  abilities combined with its general usefulness made it a defining move  on several Pokemon in UU and OU. This wasn't a tutor, but it was a TM,  and by golly if it doesn't return for the sequel.</p>

<h4>New Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/597.png" alt="" />

<p>I can think of no Pokemon that would enjoy Roost more than a  Pokemon that is only an absurdly powerful sweeper over 50% HP. Archeops  can't take a lot of hits in particular, so you might need to use it with  Substitute, but the fact remains that a first bird that isn't stuck in  its last 50% HP is a huge threat.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/665.png" alt="" />

<p>Hydreigon's defenses are fairly mediocre, but they're strong  enough to be able to take a hit after Life Orb damage, and that's all  Hydreigon really needs to decimate foes. Roost would simply make it much  more difficult to risk switching out of, because it could be back up to  full power immediately. Definitely a scary prospect.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/667.png" alt="" />

<p>Take Morning Sun, then remove weather dependency. Meet the new,  improved Volcarona. It goes without saying that such a powerful pokemon  with one of the best stat-up moves in the game would love a more  reliable form of recovery, and Roost suits the need of this big bug  perfectly.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/651.png" alt="" />

<p>Poor Druddigon needs some love, and at least it has wings to  use. Its decent bulk and Rough Skin make the move a good fit, and with  its more offensive Sheer Force, it could still use some healing for the  one or two moves that don't benefit from it.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/477.png" alt="" />

<p>Poison Heal and Roost? Believe it! Poison Heal already makes  Gliscor a nightmare to deal with, Roost would just be piling on.. Hope  you brought a strong special attacker, otherwise you'll be  SOL.</p>

<h2>New-s you can Use:</h2>

<p>These can be old moves or they can be new moves. Either way,  they've never been tutors before, though they may have had cameos as TMs  way back in the day. These are far less likely than the previous  entries, but a man can dream, can't he?</p>

<h3>Spikes:</h3>

<p>Spikes has always been an excellent move hampered by poor  distribution. Much like Stealth Rock's TM Status last Gen solidified it  as a metagame-changing force, a more available set of Spikes users could  drastically shift the metagame.</p>

<h4>Gen V Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/619.png" alt="" />

<p>The scariest Spikes users are those that have the bulk to set  them up and the force to threaten any active threats. Escavalier  performs this role well, and unlike many Pokemon that would enjoy  Spikes, it has little competition in its moveslots. Its high Defense and  crucial Dragon resist make setting up a layer child's play when used  properly.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/626.png" alt="" />

<p>Galvantula would be a Spiker more in the mold of Roserade. It's  powerful Electric and Bug STABs address Flying types and the large  number of Levitating Psychics, and it's fast enough to get a hit on most  of them. While it is frail, it can often get that attack in, and the  threat it offers can give it an opportunity to use Spikes.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/668.png" alt="" />

<p>Cobalion mixes the offensive and defensive Spiking style,  having an excellent defensive typing backed up with decent speed and  solid offense. Close Combat / Roar / Thunder Wave / Spikes provide a  good mix of support and shuffling functions, while still breaking  through a select few targets.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/208.png" alt="" />

<p>Finally a chance for a Ground-type to learn Spikes. Steelix has  possibly the best mix of skills for a slow Spikes user, having absurd  Defense, passable special bulk, phazing, Taunt, and even double hazards  with Stealth Rock. Steelix takes approximately lol% switching into  Outrage and can quickly get hazards up and phaze opponents away. Its  only true weakness is a lack of reliable recovery, but Steelix has  enough other positives to make up for it.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/376.png" alt="" />

<p>With exceptionally good bulk, excellent offensive options, and a  well-balanced typing, Metagross can utilize Spikes just as well as its  4th Gen iteration could use Stealth Rock. Spikes is more relevant in  this metagame, and so is having a Steel-type with neutrality to  Fighting. Metagross provides both, and a backstop to many special  attackers. Combine Spikes with another of Metagross's Tutor moves,  Gravity, and Metagross can be quite a potent strategic force on any  team.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/31.png" alt="" />

<p>Nidoqueen might enjoy some punches with Sheer Force, but truly,  as a defensive Pokemon, she'd rather pick up a hazard outside Toxic  Spikes, and either Spikes or Stealth Rock would work. The ability to set  up a more relevant metagame hazard combined with a boosted Ice Beam  will make Nidoqueen a much more versatile threat, and as such, she'd  also be the only Spiker with access to Fire Blast, an attack that trumps  other Spikers. Nidoking could also perform this function with Spikes,  but Nidoking is much better off using Sheer Force for all-out offense  rather than threat maintenance.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/28.png" alt="" />

<p>Another Ground-type, Sandslash can exemplify a faster Spiker by  utilizing Spikes with Sand Rush. With decent physical bulk and a  minimum speed of 332 in Sand, Sandslash has some playing room for EVs,  and unlike Excadrill, it doesn't have to focus solely on offense.  Overall it has somewhat of a mediocrity problem, but with Rapid Spin,  Super Fang, and the old standby of Earthquake and Stone Edge as movepool  options, Sandslash could be a formidable Spiker.</p>

<h3>Zap Cannon:</h3>

<p>In ancient times long past, getting a 50% Accuracy move to hit  was an impossible endeavor if you didn't have Lock-On or Mind Reader.  With Telekinesis, Gravity, No Guard, and even Hone Claws and Coil, that  statement is not entirely true anymore.</p>

<h4>New Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/653.png" alt="" />

<p>So you've got No Guard, Dynamicpunch, and now Zap Cannon, and  you're the only Pokemon immune to both attacks. Combined with Substitute  or even the aforementioned Iron Head (or possibly Zen Headbutt), this  could be the single most excruciating set to play against. If you fail,  just Golurk more.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/626.png" alt="" />

<p>There are advantages to being an Electric type with neutrality  to Ground attacks. Between Compoundeyes and Gravity set up by an ally,  your Zap Cannon is raised to 100% Accuracy (108% if you want to be  technical). Have fun doing incredible damage and paralyzing your enemies  at the same time. The regular 65% Accuracy is shaky I suppose, but  then, no one suspects the spider.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/639.png" alt="" />

<p>There are probably more glamorous things for a living lantern  to do than troll opponents with Shadow Tag, Telekinesis, and Zap Cannon,  but by golly if it isn't going to be entertaining. It'll be a trick to  pull off, but fun nonetheless. Just imagine a set of Telekinesis / Zap  Cannon / Inferno / Calm Mind. Problem, accuracy?</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/151.png" alt="" />

<p>Feelin' lucky? I guess Golurk does Dynamicpunch + Zap Cannon  better than Mew, but then again, Mew can also set up Gravity and U-turn  away. Can we get Horn Drill back too?</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/121.png" alt="" />

<p>With Gravity on the field, Zap Cannon has 86% accuracy, and  Starmie does love spreading paralysis. I suppose Thunder is safer but  hey, live a little. Everyone loves implausible hitting Zap Cannon!  Starmie can also use Telekinesis for the same effect, although the  opponent can switch out.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/196.png" alt="" />

<p>It's been a long time since Espeon had a good coverage move,  and while I suppose Telekinesis ruins the surprise, it also lets you  finally hit with it. The fact you can get free switch-ins on hazards and  force your opponent out can't hurt though.</p>

<h3>Icicle Crash:</h3>

<p>Finally an Ice move with decent Base Power. To recap, it's 85  Base Power, 90% Accuracy, and has a 30% chance to flinch. Pretty good  stats, too bad its distribution is so terrible. It begs for more  access.</p>

<h4>Gen V Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/595.png" alt="" />

<p>Carracosta will always have somewhat of an accuracy problem  with any attack but Waterfall. Icicle Crash gives it a strong addition  to its coverage, and the chance for flinch makes Carracosta even more  dangerous after a Shell Smash. I suppose it could also have used Ice  Punch above, but 108 Base Attack is nothing to write home about in OU,  even boosted.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/676.png" alt="" />

<p>Once again, Kyurem needs physical STAB, any physical STAB.  Icicle Crash will fit well on Kyurem, especially Scarf variants. Kyurem  is really powerful enough where consistency matters more than power, but  all the same, Icicle Crash would be very welcome addition.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/531.png" alt="" />

<p>Samurott is another Pokemon that could do with adding some  physical Ice attacks. While its previous forms could probably justify  Ice Punch, Icicle Crash would go a long way to at least giving Samurott  some credibility. Throw in Superpower while the going is hot, this  Pokemon needs it, it's just Samurott-en otherwise.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/466.png" alt="" />

<p>Sneasel's relatives have only been pining for strong physical  Ice moves since GSC. Icicle Crash would give Weavile a much needed  upgrade that would work well off of its high speed. A definite new must  in any set.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/478.png" alt="" />

<p>Remember when I said Thick Fat Mamoswine got trolled? Yeah,  that's the reason it's here again. With Icicle Crash in the Thick Fat  Mamoswine arsenal, it won't have nearly as many problems damaging  opponents. It just hits so hard, it's ridiculous.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/99.png" alt="" />

<p>Not only does Kingler have a massive 130 Attack, its Hidden  Ability is Sheer Force, which would make Icicle Crash a formidable part  of its offense and give it the kind of coverage move it always wanted.  While we're on the subject of wish lists, giving Kingler Razor Shell  couldn't hurt either, Game Freak. Just sayin'.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/367.png" alt="" />

<p>Huntail may be the ugly cousin of Gorebyss when it comes to  Smashpassing, but Icicle Crash would give it an excellent addition to  its physical movepool to allow it to be a more physically oriented  Smashpasser. Ice Fang just doesn't cut it for power.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/232.png" alt="" />

<p>An odd choice perhaps, but Donphan has a fairly odd movepool  among Ground types. Icicle Crash would make it a much more viable dragon  slayer than Ice Shard does now, and its access to Sturdy can often  provide it the turn it needs to use the attack.</p>

<h3>Drill Run:</h3>

<p>Another unique attack in Gen V. It's much weaker than  Earthquake with only 80 Base Power, 95% Accuracy, and a high crit  chance, but it has a very niche distribution that could be  expanded.</p>

<h4>Gen V Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/619.png" alt="" />

<p>Escavalier has always had coverage problems, and anything that  can alleviate that need is welcome on a Pokemon with such massive  offensive capability. Drill Run doesn't hit as many targets as  Superpower, but it does fragment Fire-type attackers, maim several Steel  types, and eliminate what few Electric-types remain. Definitely more  useful under Gravity, where Megahorn becomes reliable as well.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/631.png" alt="" />

<p>An unlikely candidate as it isn't really Drill-based at all,  but again, Klinklang's physical movepool sorely lacks diversity, and  anything that allows it to use its unique Shift Gear attack is  incredibly helpful.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/131.png" alt="" />

<p>For all of Lapras' expansive movepool, it never received  Earthquake. Drill Run patches up a hole in its offense, allowing it to  strike Electric-types hard after a Dragon Dance. If combined with Icicle  Crash the set would be very formidable indeed. Lapras is not lacking  for bulk, and in Drizzle, it can utilize Hydration + Rest to get back to  full health immediately. Even without Icicle Crash, Waterfall and Ice  Shard would serve it well.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/78.png" alt="" />

<p>Rapidash's Speed is probably under-appreciated with all the new  108 Spe legends running about, but it's still a tick faster than many  Pokemon, and Drill Run adds some much needed offensive diversity to its  physical movepool.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/119.png" alt="" />

<p>SEAKING FUCK YEAH! No sense in being immune to Electric attacks  if you can't hit them back. Too bad it still can't drill through  Ferrothorn.</p>

<h3>Coil:</h3>

<p>One of the most unique attacks out there, it raises Attack,  Defense, and accuracy. A lot of Pokemon could put that to good  use.</p>

<h4>Gen V Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/573.png" alt="" />

<p>Megahorn immediately comes to mind as a move that benefits from  Coil, but don't forget Scolipede can also use Baton Pass. Coil can be  quite enviable to Pokemon with imperfect accuracy or patchy Defense, and  it cleans up the accuracy of moves like Thunder, Focus Blast, and  Blizzard quite nicely.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/631.png" alt="" />

<p>Much like Quiver Dance and Volcarona, Coil raises Klinklang's  best stats. Additionally it can use the accuracy boost on Gear Grind to  patch up Zap Cannon's accuracy for the more sadistic among you. One Coil  during Gravity ups Zap Cannon's Accuracy to over 100%, but that was  discussed earlier.</p>

<h4>Old Threats:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/350.png" alt="" />

<p>Milotic's only real weak point is its Defense. Marvel Scale  only works when Miltoic is statused, and Toxic Orb and Flame Orb simply  aren't conducive to tanking, even if you have Recover. Milotic can also  utilize the accuracy boost Coil offers, bringing Hypnosis up to a  respectable 80 Accuracy after one use, patch up Hydro Pump and Blizzard,  and even allow Milotic to use Dragon Tail more effectively to phaze, a  skill it only obtained in this generation.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/208.png" alt="" />

<p>With Sheer Force in its arsenal, Accuracy is Steelix's only  hobgoblin. Coil is possibly the most synergistic move Steelix could ever  possess, bumping up its Sheer Force boosted Iron Tail to over 100%  accuracy and patching up Rock Slide and the elemental Fangs, while  simultaneously boosting Steelix's two most relevant stats. As a giant  iron snake, one wonders why Steelix did not get Coil before, but surely  it could use it well. Steelix has no lack of inaccurate physical attacks  it would like to use.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/149.png" alt="" />

<p>The serpentine Dragonair or Dratini could help Dragonite  inherit this move, and Dragonite would happily abuse it to the maximum  extent. Not only does it patch up Dragonite's horde of 70% accurate  Special Attacks, it also buffs Dragon Rush in both Attack and Accuracy,  making it a very reliable attack with good power and a flinch chance.  This is to say nothing of what it does for bulky sets, which could run  it with Roost, Dragon Tail, and Multiscale.</p>

<h2>The Biggest Winners (and Losers)</h2>

<p>While all this is still speculative, tutors always favor some  Pokemon over others. This listing is based on the most likely tutors to  be implemented (those listed as well as previous tutors that may advance  forward from a previous generation). Here are my predictions for the  biggest winners and losers. These won't necessarily become the top  metagame threats, they'll just be the Pokemon that benefit  most.</p>

<h3>Top 5 Winners:</h3>

<h4>1. Conkeldurr</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/562.png" alt="" />

<p>Once Conkeldurr gets some coverage in its movepool, all bets  are off. Elemental Punches are useful on every set, and will be usable  with all 3 of Conkeldurr's abilities. Sheer Force Life Orb will finally  have enough diversity to be considered over Flame Orb Guts, and both  sets are absolutely monstrous combined with Bulk Up + Drain Punch. Each  set will, for the most part, have different counters based almost solely  on what attacks Conkeldurr is utilizing. Conkeldurr will still have  some issues with Reuniclus, but most of its other checks and counters  will have a much, much more difficult time dealing with it.</p>

<h4>2. Haxorus</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/642.png" alt="" />

<p>Like Scizor's Bullet Punch in Generation IV, Haxorus really  only needs one move to massively increase its threat level. Fire Punch  alone allows it to break through its two biggest nuisances, Skarmory and  Ferrothorn, and if combined with even more esoteric attacks like Sucker  Punch, Superpower, and Zen Headbutt, Haxorus is going to see a meteoric  rise. It will always have that Speed issue clocking in at 97 Base, but  its simply terrifying to think of the havoc it could wreak. Maybe this  is just more overhype that was common at its initial release, but people  already know what Haxorus is and what Haxorus does.</p>

<h4>3. Mamoswine</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/478.png" alt="" />

<p>On the flip side of a tutor release, there are Pokemon that  exploit the increasing 4MSS of all metagame threats. Given even a few  useful tutors of its own like Icicle Crash and Superpower, Thick Fat  Mamoswine can abuse its "BoltBeam" resistance to pressure switch-ins  and, in general, exploit the increased frequency of Electric and Ice  coverage moves. Even without such a blessing, decent HP / Defense and  neutrality to Ice still make Mamoswine a top contender, and if Haxorus  rises, so too will the need for a powerful Ice Shard user.</p>

<h4>4. Kyurem</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/676.png" alt="" />

<p>If Kyurem unlocks even a semblance of a reliable physical  movepool from tutors, its neutrality to the elemental punches and  excellent general bulk will allow it to thrive. Kyurem's mixed attacking  prowess is mostly held up by the fact you can't "go mixed" if you're  limited to Outrage, Dragon Claw, and Stone Edge as good physical  attacks.. Ice Punch (and / or Icicle Crash) and Superpower will go a  long way in giving Kyurem a wallbreaking reputation. In the end, it will  function much like Dragonite, save it won't have the threat of Dragon  Dance (but will have much, much nastier special attacks). If these are  released with elemental "Sky Attacks," as limited as those might be,  they'll provide a threat too large to ignore. Not that special attacks  would harm it either. Earth Power would also be a great  pick-up.</p>

<h4>5. Klinklang</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/631.png" alt="" />

<p>If tutors can unlock Klinklang's physical movepool, it might go  somewhere yet. It's got an excellent stat booster and nothing to really  use it with. If tutors fix this and give it a few other toys, Klinklang  might not rise too much, but it will find its niche. Being pure Steel  isn't usually beneficial unless you have the offense to exploit it, and  if Shift Gear becomes a legitimate offensive threat, then Klinklang will  see use yet.</p>

<h3>Top 5 Losers:</h3>

<h4>1. Ferrothorn</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/628.png" alt="" />

<p>So many Pokemon have been pining for a way to defeat the thorny  nuisance that even though both Fire Punch and Superpower activate Iron  Barbs + Rocky Helmet, everything in the metagame still wants a way to  punch this thing in the face. Wide distribution of the attacks will  endure Ferrothorn sleeps less soundly in general and against Haxorus  specifically. It will always have its bulk in Rain, but without an  ability to switch in at little risk against most 5th Generation threats,  Ferrothorn will receive what many believe is a long-overdue trip to the  middle of the pack.</p>

<h4>2. Dragonite</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/149.png" alt="" />

<p>Whenever Dragons faster than Dragonite get a major boost,  Dragonite suffers. Getting Superpower back with Multiscale would  certainly help it in some instances, but the proliferation of Ice Punch,  along with the buffing of Haxorus and Kyurem, leaves Dragonite out in,  well, the cold. It will still be difficult to unseat, but there's no  denying the caliber of attackers that want to use Ice Punch this  generation is much higher, and Roost + Multiscale only goes so  far.</p>

<h4>3. Politoed</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/186.png" alt="" />

<p>With everyone gunning for Ferrothorn, very few players will  forget what enables it to be such a menace. Needless to say, Politoed  suffers like Dragonite does from a lot of strong physical attackers  getting access to a super-effective physical attack (ThunderPunch to  Dragonite's Ice Punch). What used to be an easy switch in to Darmanitan  now becomes a big gamble, to say nothing of the new Fighting-types who  might want ThunderPunch to aim at both it, Jellicent, and Gyarados.  Mienshao and Bisharp again come to mind as Pokemon with no qualms  shifting around their coverage options, and both of them have Swords  Dance to boot.</p>

<h4>4. Landorus</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/675.png" alt="" />

<p>As the list bears out, the biggest losers in a tutor release  tend to be those Pokemon that are huge metagame threats now, but have 4x  weaknesses to a new, widely distributed Move Tutor. Unlike Gliscor, who  benefits from huge Defense and possibly Roost + Poison Heal if it gets  lucky, Landorus gets no such benefit, and a widely distributed Ice Punch  to powerful metagame attackers dampens its threat. Where before it  could switch into Conkeldurr with relative impunity, Conkeldurr behind a  Bulk Up can now crush Landorus in the blink of an eye. Although this  speculation only covers the top beneficiaries, the general availability  of the attack also has an impact. Mienshao for example isn't listed, but  it's faster than Landorus and has an excellent 125 Base Attack. The  implications of wide distribution make it that much harder for Landorus  to do it job.</p>

<h4>5. Forretress</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/205.png" alt="" />

<p>While Forretress might deserve a higher spot because it's  higher on the threat list than Landorus, Forretress doesn't make out too  badly even in light of Pokemon aiming for Ferrothorn. In the first  place, it's not weak to Superpower and it resists Ice Punch, a much more  important attack than ThunderPunch generally. Most tutor releases  greatly bias physical attacks, and that's where Forretress has its best  bulk. In addition, if Spikes or Stealth Rock actually do become tutors,  Forretress still has the Rapid Spin function. All in all it still won't  be pretty, but Forretress still has its uses.</p>

<h2>Niche Corner:</h2>

<p>A little bonus if you haven't had enough speculation. Here's a  few Pokemon with past Gen Tutors or TMs who would flourish with an old  move.</p>

<h4>Focus Punch:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/566.png" alt="" /> <img src="/download/sprites/bw/601.png" alt="" />

<p>Throh's offense has always been suspect, but its great defenses  along with 101 HP Subs make it an excellent user of Focus Punch. Its  defenses are a bit more balanced than Hariyama's, so it can use this and  Guts in tandem to offer a credible threat. Zoroark can use Focus Punch  in an entirely different manner, faking out opponents and forcing them  to switch into the powerful attack.</p>

<h4>Giga Drain:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/3.png" alt="" />

<p>When Venusaur picked up Chlorophyll, it lost Giga Drain. With  Growth boosting both offenses by +2 in the Sun, Giga Drain becomes more  potent than ever, and provides Venusaur with an offensive healing option  not unlike Conkeldurr enjoys with Bulk Up and Drain Punch. Giga Drain  is certainly more reliable than SolarBeam, and its effect is more useful  than Energy Ball's.</p>

<h4>Gravity:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/575.png" alt="" />

<p>Whimsicott has the unenviable combination of Chlorophyll for an  ability and Hurricane for a coverage attack. Obviously this makes  operating in sun a challenge if Whimsicott ever wants to attack, but  Gravity patches that and a few things up. Gravity would be useful on  both Chlorophyll and Prankster sets, increasing GrassWhistle's accuracy  to 91%. Whimsicott also naturally resists Ground-type attacks, so it has  nothing to fear from disabling immunities to Ground. Even in sun,  Hurricane supported by Gravity still has 83% Accuracy. Finally,  Whimsicott has U-turn, so it can act as the perfect pivot on a Gravity  team.</p>

<h4>Gunk Shot:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/34.png" alt="" />

<p>Gunk Shot has every quality Nidoking could possibly want. It's  got high Base Power, STAB, and an effect chance, meaning that Nidoking  can boost it with Sheer Force. What's more, its only drawback is  questionable accuracy, which can be fixed with Hone Claws. Needless to  say, this makes Nidoking a dangerous physical threat with a set of Hone  Claws / Gunk Shot / Earthquake and a coverage move of choice @ Life  Orb.</p>

<h4>Pain Split:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/593.png" alt="" />

<p>Unbelievably, Cofagrigus has no form of healing outside of  Rest. Pain Split addresses the issue, allowing Cofagrigus to use Mummy  and its defenses more proactively against strong attackers. A burned  Conkeldurr without Guts is useless against Cofagrigus. Likewise taking a  bit hit from an attack like Outrage and Pain Splitting will allow  Cofagrigus a decent shot of coming in later, after your Steel-type  absorbs the second hit.</p>

<h4>Outrage:</h4>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/373.png" alt="" />

<p>Salamence is back with a lot of Moxie. With a female available  in Dream World and this tutor, Salamence will be back in its top,  terrifying form. Without Intimidate, it won't have quite the buffer  against Fighting attacks it used to, but both the Dragon Dance and Scarf  sets will welcome back the sheer power of Outrage. Salamence with  Outrage, Dragon Dance, and Moxie will be the end.</p>
