Paralyzes opponent.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Paralyzes the target. Ghost-types are not immune. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Glare is a move that will reliably paralyze almost any Pokemon. It also got an accuracy boost in BW, making it even more reliable. However, thanks to the poor distribution it still won't be seen much. Dunsparce can now use it to reliably paralyze his targets as an option instead of Thunder Wave, hitting Ground-types as a bonus. Druddigon can somewhat use this too, crippling faster threats so it won't have to rely on Trick Room to outspeed its counters. Apart from these rare cases, it will not be seen regularly in the competitive environment.</p>
