    <p>Hello again, everyone! Welcome to yet another edition of the Smog, your global magazine for all things Pok&eacute;mon in the competitive and entertainment arenas! Issue #27 comes loaded with a plethora of articles that touch on a variety of topics &mdash; we have analyses and tips on Rain Offense playstyles in OverUsed as well as in VGC, Underrated Movesets, Suspect Testing, BW2 OU Offense, OU and RU Spotlight Pok&eacute;mon, Pok&eacute; Biology, the Interview, and much more! As usual, the Staff continues to work very hard to introduce new contributors to the Smog, and as a result, our pool of writers, artists, grammar checkers, and HTMLers is constantly growing. This allows us to inject each release with a healthy dose of dynamism in the list of topics to choose from. These guys do an amazing job here, and I speak for the Smog Staff when I say they deserve a lot of credit for the time they put into contributing to such a fast-paced and vibrant project. Thank you!</p>

   <p>As a last remark before moving on to the closing words for this post, I'd like to thank our talented <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/member.php?u=3892">Yilx</a> &mdash; he's the one responsible for the stunning cover this issue and also one of our most prolific artists at the Smog. Thank you for all your work, Yilx!</p>
