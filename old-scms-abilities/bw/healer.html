<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In multi battles, the wielder has a 30% chance of removing status conditions from each adjacent ally at the end of every turn. If multiple Pokemon have Healer, each effect is applied separately.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Healer is somewhat effective on <a href="/bw/pokemon/blissey">Blissey</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/audino">Audino</a> in non-singles battles, but careful placement must be considered in order to heal both teammates in triple battles.</p>
