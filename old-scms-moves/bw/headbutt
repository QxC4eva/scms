<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Headbutt is too weak to be useful on most Pokemon. Dunsparce, with Serene Grace, can abuse Headbutt's flinch chance along with paralysis from Glare. Many Pokemon can attempt to use it for the flinch chance, but it is far too weak to be recommended for competitive use when there are so many better options available.</p>
