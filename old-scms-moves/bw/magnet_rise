[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For 5 turns, the user is immune to Ground-type attacks and the effects of Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and the ability Arena Trap as long as it remains active. If the user uses Baton Pass, the replacement will gain the effect. Ingrain, Smack Down, and Iron Ball override this move if the user is under any of their effects. Fails if the user is already under this effect or the effects of Ingrain or Smack Down. This move cannot be used while Gravity is in effect. The effect is lost if the user switches out. If it is passed to another Pokemon via Baton Pass, then that Pokemon takes no damage from Spikes or Toxic Spikes upon switching in.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While rarely seen, Magnet Rise can be used on Pokemon that are weak to Ground-type moves, providing a useful immunity. This can foil some checks or counters, and is useful on Pokemon with several resistances, such as Magnezone. This is proven even more useful considering many of the Steel-types that Magnezone is capable of trapping and eliminating carry Earthquake, particularly Bronzong and Metagross. A tactic to make the most of Magnet Rise is to combine it with Substitute, since rarely will the opposing Steel-type have another attack that will be able to break the Substitute. Once floating with Magnet Rise and behind a Substitute, Magnezone is free to KO the Steel-type and have basically a free hit on whatever your opponent chooses to switch in next. However, the move's effectiveness is hampered by the fact that it is negated when the user switches and that it only lasts for five turns.</p>
