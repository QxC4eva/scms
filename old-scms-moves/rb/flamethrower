10% chance to burn.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to burn the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Great Base Power and perfect accuracy. This move would be great if Fire Blast didn't boast a 30% burn chance in trade for 15% accuracy and Fire-types were slightly better in RBY; but that's not the case, so Flamethrower is not seen much. Its main use is when you can't rely on Fire Blast's accuracy.</p>
