<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/151.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Mew</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Synchronize<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Zen Headbutt<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Swords Dance</p>

<p>Swords Dance Mew is a significantly forgotten threat in the current metagame. Able to OHKO Roserade with Zen Headbutt, Mew is a true tank that is good at cleaning up. Despite the former popularity of its cousin, Swords Dance Celebi, people still don't seem to expect Sucker Punch. Although it's the Pokemon I put first in the teambuilder so that I can bluff lead support Mew, I only actually lead Mew if I expect Roserade to lead for the enemy team.</p>

<p><strong>Gligar</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Sand Veil<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 208 Def / 48 Spe<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Roost</p>

<p>Gligar is mostly a utility defensive Pokemon for this team, able to handle Heracross and Escavalier while setting up Stealth Rock. Eviolite makes Gligar bulky enough to take on practically any physical threat that doesn't carry Water or Ice attacks. The speed EVs are there to outrun minimum speed Roserade, should the situation arise. Gligar also helps against Sand when it comes to taking on Stoutland, Golurk and Rhyperior. </p>

<p><strong>Porygon2</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Download<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Discharge<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Tri Attack<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>The MVP and star of the show, offensive Porygon2 is hands down the strongest and most useful Pokemon I've used yet in UU. Trace is not particularly useful in UU, and Download allows you to hit very, very hard if you switch in on a defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon. The nice part about being Normal type is that you can switch Porygon2 into a really large range of Pokemon, from bulky Waters to Donphan. I use Discharge over Thunderbolt because my team likes paralysis and because quite a few Pokemon are 2HKOed by Discharge + Tri Attack if Discharge paralyzes them (Kingdra being the most notable example). </p>

<p><strong>Mamoswine</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Snow Cloak<br />
EVs: 72 HP / 252 Atk / 184 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Ice Shard<br />
- Icicle Spear</p>

<p>Most Sand teams have absolutely no idea what to do against Mamoswine. One of the most threatening and underrated Pokemon in UU, Mamoswine gives me a second priority user, which is useful for handling threats that have already set up. A safer switch into Pokemon like Jolteon than Gligar is, given its neutrality to Ice. The EVs are a little strange; I couldn't think of a good speed number to target, so I just went with outspeeding Adamant Honchkrow. I realize that Icicle Crash is probably more reliable overall than Icicle Spear, but I tend to be a little paranoid regarding hitting Pokemon like SubSeed Abomasnow and SubRoost Zapdos. Superpower is my best shot at KOing Snorlax and enemy Porygon2. </p>

<p><strong>Spiritomb</strong> @ BlackGlasses<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpA<br />
Brave Nature<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Shadow Sneak<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting</p>

<p>No one ever expects BlackGlasses Spiritomb! Obviously useful for Alakazam, Spiritomb's Sucker Punch is actually a lot stronger than one would think--it does 45.2% - 53.8% to Flygon, for instance. A strong Pursuit makes Stoutland much easier for my team to deal with. Hidden Power Fighting is a relatively new addition to this set, it is 100% there for keeping Bisharp from switching in; Bisharp is an absolute terror for this team. </p>

<p><strong>Kingdra</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Swift Swim<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Surf<br />
- Draco Meteor<br />
- Dragon Pulse</p>

<p>If you don't have Chansey or Empoleon, you're in for a world of hurt. To give you an idea, 188 HP /216 SpD Careful Snorlax takes 35.4% - 41.9% from Hydro Pump. You need something in UU to take Victini V-Creates, Darmanitan Flare Blitzes and Chandelure Fire Blasts, and Kingdra does it well while hitting virtually everything hard. The nice thing about Specs Kingdra is that ChestoRest DD Kingdra is what everyone tends to worry about, meaning you receive plenty of opportunities to 2HKO Pokemon like Blastoise with Draco Meteor.</p>
