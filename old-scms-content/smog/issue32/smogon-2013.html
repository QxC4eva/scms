<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Another year, another nutshell article to laugh at all the quibbling, sniveling, and groveling antics that happen in a regular year at Smogon University. This may not be everything noteworthy that occurred and may not even all be entirely true (memory is a fickle thing), but this is how we here at The Smog choose to remember the events of 2013. May 2014 be just as fun-filled as this one!

            The new OU council is formed, comprising of Aldaron, Haunter, McMeghan, M Dragon, and Nachos. So when something is banned in OU, it's because one of these guys couldn't handle it while laddering, and not because they recognized those Pok&eacute;mon are unhealthy for the tier or over-centralizing. It's certainly that other thing because all of them are completely ban-happy players.

            Discussions begin on if Smogon should adapt to level 50 as the standard level for competitive battles. The community elects to keep level 100, as everyone agrees that level 100 is just a more bad-ass number. Not even Wi-Fi players care we didn't make the change.

            The Create-A-Pok&eacute;mon Contributor badge is created to award the players who assisted in the competitive process of CAP. They chose the Glacier Badge because every CAP is unique like a snowflake, and like the glacier the badge is named for, the process to making a CAP is slow and meandering.

            Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! Forums are now moved back to the Smogon Forums for matters such as room suggestions, and general news is posted on the Smogon Forums. Discipline Appeals are still a part of PS! Forums because accounts are linked. Now there is no excuse for anyone to post discussions on the PS! Forums nobody cares nor reads about anything posted there.

            The OU council quick-bans Blaziken and Deoxys due to their powerful and centralizing nature within the tier. Despite the posting of well-thought-out explanations, many outsiders who lack any experience with competitive battling decry these bans because these Pok&eacute;mon 'are their favorites' and feel it is unfair.

            The official start of the dark saga of SPL drama where everyone bickers and nobody is happy about any change. Everyone demands one thing, only for it to happen, then demands the exact opposite. Everyone is forced to argue on things they have long stopped caring about. With the tournament now gearing up to round one, everyone is starting to actually enjoy themselves again.

            The Battle Spot forum is made official for Smogon members to play the Wi-Fi 3v3 battles as played on the 3DS games. No we didn't ban anything why would you even think that slap yourself for me if you thought that.
