Overview
########

Shiftry jumped from being a niche NU sweeper to one of the best assets to have on an offensive team in just one generation thanks to the Defog buff. It gives Shiftry a niche no other Pokemon has, being a strong offensive Defogger with no safe switch-ins. With Life Orb, Shiftry's good Attack can cripple defensive cores early game with Knock Off, and its access to Sucker Punch means it can act as a revenge killer late-game. This also means that Braviary can't deter Shiftry from using Defog, as Shiftry can KO it on the switch with Knock Off and Sucker Punch. Not only does Shiftry have good Attack, but it also has good Special Attack and Leaf Storm to threaten Pokemon such as Alomomola and Rhyperior. Sadly, it's average Speed makes it a bit hard to use Defog against offensive teams, and its poor Grass / Dark typing along with its below average defenses means it is KOed easily. The fact that its STAB options are walled by common Pokemon like Cobalion and Virizion doesn't help either. Still, Shiftry can make use of its typing to check threatening Pokemon such as Slowking, Clawitzer, Heliolisk, and Jolteon, and possibly take them out with the appropriate move.

Moves
========

Defog is the reason to use Shiftry, and it's an important move to have on a lot of teams as it can clear hazards from both sides of the field and support Shiftry's team. Knock Off is a strong STAB move that cripples a lot of Pokemon, and it's very hard to switch into. Sucker Punch is good to have on Shiftry since it also gets STAB, and gives it a way of getting past faster Pokemon like Heliolisk and Jolteon. It also means it can revenge kill some Pokemon. Leaf Storm means that Shiftry will be able to KO Pokemon like Alomomola, Rhyperior, and Gligar, though the latter can only be KOed after it has taken a Knock Off. Leaf Storm also allows Shiftry to serve as a potential wallbreaker with its decent offensive stats and Knock Off, which is the bane of any defensive Pokemon.

Set Details
========

The EVs are to maximize Attack and Speed, with the remaining dumped into Special Attack. This allows Shiftry to outspeed Pokemon like neutral-natured Tyrantrum and everything below it, while it Speed ties with Adamant Gallade. Life Orb is the item of choice as it boosts Shiftry's damage output. Additionally, a Hasty nature can be used to make Shiftry speed tie with Jolly Gallade, Kabutops, and outspeed anything slower. It could also out-prioritize Adamant Hitmonlee's Mach Punch, but it will make Shiftry lose out on a lot of power.

Usage Tips
========

Shiftry is a Pokemon that can be used throughout the entire match, be it early-, mid-, or late-game. If you see an opportunity to use Defog, take it, otherwise Knock Off is a safe option to go for. Use Shiftry to cripple defensive cores and walls like Rhyperior and Alomomola with Knock Off and Leaf Storm early-game, and to hit Pokemon such as Amoonguss hard on the switch with Knock Off. If possible, save Shiftry for late-game cleaning or to act as a revenge killer. It can also come in mid-game if a Defog is needed. With a bit of prediction, it can switch into Pokemon like Slowking, Rhyperior, and Clawitzer, and take them out, but beware of a possible Scald burn in Slowking and Clawitzer's case, and they all could potentially KO Shiftry if it switches into the wrong move.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that like entry hazards off of the field generally like having Shiftry as a partner. This includes Moltres and Delphox, especially because Shiftry is able to get past their counters, Slowking and Jellicent. Additionally, pairing it with Assault Vest Slowking creates a sort of Fire / Water / Grass core which can work pretty nicely, both offensively and defensively, with Slowking being able to easily pivot in and out. Doublade synergizes well with Shiftry since it can come in on Cobalion and Virizion, two of Shiftry's counters, and use them as set up fodder.

Other Options
########

A set consisting of Swords Dance, Knock Off, Seed Bomb, and Sucker Punch can be used, but it is generally outclassed by other Pokemon, such as Zoroark and Virizion, and Defog is one of the main reasons of using Shiftry. Nasty Plot with Giga Drain and Dark Pulse is another option, but it's also outclassed. Since Shiftry lures in Cobalion easily, Focus Blast can be used to take it by surprise, though it doesn't have much space for it. Explosion can be utilized on any set to go out with a bang and possibly allow Shiftry to take something with it, but Shiftry doesn't really have much place for it. Finally, Shiftry can utilize a Sunny Day set with Solar Beam for sun teams, but as mentioned before, Defog is one of the few reasons to use Shiftry, and gives it its niche.

Checks & Counters
########

**Cobalion**: Cobalion resists both of Shiftry's STAB moves, and can potentially get a Justified boost by switching into Knock Off. It also has Close Combat to KO Shiftry.

**Virizion**: It can appreciate a Justified boost, can take anything Shiftry throws at it, and retaliate with Close Combat.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon that can take a Sucker Punch can easily revenge kill Shiftry. This includes Braviary, Hitmonlee, Moltres, and Zoroark, among others.

**Pokemon that resist its STABs**: Pokemon that can take Knock Off, Leaf Storm or Sucker Punch can easily counter Shiftry. This includes Drapion, Skuntank, Hitmontop, Emboar, Druddigon, Physically Defensive Amoonguss, and Tangrowth.
