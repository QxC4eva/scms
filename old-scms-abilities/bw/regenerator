[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder leaves the field (whether by manual switching or moves such as <a href="/bw/moves/roar">Roar</a>), it heals 1/3 of its max HP.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Incredibly powerful, especially on bulky Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/slowbro">Slowbro</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/reuniclus">Reuniclus</a>. Sometimes the alternative option will be more favorable, but for a defensive team settled down for the long game, Regenerator is an amazing ability to bolster the longevity of your Pokemon. <a href="/bw/pokemon/ho-oh">Ho-Oh</a> in particular really appreciates this ability, as it alleviates its 4x weakness to <a href="/bw/moves/stealth_rock">Stealth Rock</a> somewhat, as well as greatly increasing its lifespan in general. <a href="/bw/pokemon/tornadus-t">Tornadus-T</a> is another notable user, as it can use its incredibly strong STAB <a href="/bw/moves/hurricane">Hurricane</a> while recovering any HP it may lose through Stealth Rock simply by switching out, which is made easier by its access to an extremely fast <a href="/bw/moves/u-turn">U-turn</a>.</p>
