<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All attacks used by the wielder act as if they are Normal-typeâ€”if the user is Normal-type, they get STAB, and they are always resisted by Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon and are ineffective against Ghost-types. <a href="/bw/moves/thunder_wave">Thunder Wave</a> is the only status move programmed to take immunities into account (hence it not working on Ground-types), so a Normalized Thunder Wave will not paralyze Ghost-types.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This ability sucks. The users suck even more. <a href="/bw/pokemon/delcatty">Delcatty</a> is the only fully-evolved Pokemon to have this, and outside of using Thunder Wave to paralyze Ground-types, there is zero reason to use this ability.</p>
