    Moves
    ========

        Boomburst hits hard against most mons and Scrappy lets it hit Ghost-types
        Flamethrower is used mainly for Aegislash, though it can be used for other Steel-type mons
        Focus Blast is a guaranteed OHKO on 252 HP / 252 SpD TTar after SR
        Overheat is Exploud's only good 4th move as everything else is overpowered by Boomburst


    Set Details

    Usage Tips
    ========

        Boomburst can deal a lot of damage against quite a few special walls, so don't feel forced to switch
        Flamethrower should be used against most Steel-types, but if they are insanely bulky, use Overheat
        Boomburst should be spammed whenever possible without it being in serious danger
        Double switches or Voltturn should be used to get it in so it doesn't get KO'd easily
        If the opponent has a bulky Steel-type or Rock-type, predicting the switch is a viable option


    Team Options
    ========

        Teammates that threaten mons that carry Fighting-type moves
        Entry hazard carriers such as Forretress or Ferrothorn can help it score OHKO's or 2HKO's it may not normally get
        Baton Pass with Shell Smash or Quiver Dance can help Exploud Boomburst with less risk
        Baton Passers such as Scolipede can also help it outspeed threats
        Sticky Web users can help Exploud outspeed more threats
        Trick Room users could be used with no speed invested on Exploud

    Other Options
    ########

        Hammer Arm can be used over Overheat for Chansey and Blissey, though it won't do enough without investment


    Checks & Counters
    ########

        Mons that resist Normal-type moves such as AV-Ttar and Aegislash can hurt Exploud from lack of damage
        Sweepers with Fighting-type such as Keldeo or Terrakion can kill Exploud before it can deal any sort of damage
        Priority Fighting-type users such as Lucario and Conkeldurr can force it to switch quickly with Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch
        Special walls such as Blissey and Chansey wall it hard
        Breloom and Talonflame can outspeed Exploud and OHKO it before it can attack
