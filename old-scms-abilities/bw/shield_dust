<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder is unaffected by secondary effects of moves. This includes 100% occurrences, such as from <a href="/bw/moves/dynamicpunch">DynamicPunch</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/inferno">Inferno</a>. Shield Dust prevents the flinching effects of <a href="/bw/abilities/stench">Stench</a>, <a href="/bw/items/kings_rock">King's Rock</a>, and <a href="/bw/items/razor_fang">Razor Fang</a>, as well as the potential secondary effects from using <a href="/bw/moves/fling">Fling</a> with certain items. It does not prevent effects from moves where the move is dedicated to that effect, such as <a href="/bw/moves/thunder_wave">Thunder Wave</a>. It does not prevent secondary effects from moves used by this Pokemon, such as <a href="/bw/moves/close_combat">Close Combat</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/ancientpower">AncientPower</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This is actually a really good ability, but you cannot expect to see it very much when the five Pokemon that have it are <a href="/bw/pokemon/caterpie">Caterpie</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/weedle">Weedle</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/venomoth">Venomoth</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/wurmple">Wurmple</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/dustox">Dustox</a>. Venomoth is somewhat usable nowadays but would always much prefer <a href="/bw/abilities/tinted_lens">Tinted Lens</a> or <a href="/bw/abilities/wonder_skin">Wonder Skin</a> to <a href="/bw/abilities/shield_dust">Shield Dust</a>. The other four are just awful, and this is a shame, because this ability could be really good on the right Pokemon.</p>
