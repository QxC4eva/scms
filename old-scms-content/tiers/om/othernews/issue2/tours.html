<p>The Immortal's Hidden Type tour ended in February. The finals came down to Pikachuun and yoman5 in a best of 3. Pikachuun won the <a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/hiddentype-209624321">first match</a>, thanks in part to his Crawdaunt which cleaned up the last of yoman5's Pokemon with a strong Aqua Jet. <a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/hiddentype-209627823">Round two</a> went to yoman5 and his Calm Mind Keldeo. In the <a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/hiddentype-209630442">final battle</a>, things were looking good for yoman5 who was sporting a belligerent Azumarill. But it was Pikachuun who pulled a rabbit out of his hat when he sent out his own Keldeo to pick off the rest of yoman5's team. Congrats Pikachuun!</p>

<p>Rhythms is hosting a 3-person tour called <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/the-moody-tournament.3529417/">the Moody Tournament</a>. This one's layout is similar to January's Slacker Tour, another 3-person event. This time the metagames are a bit different. Teams consist of a Tier Shift, an Averagemons, and a 350 Cup player.</p>

<p>Unfixable started the 3rd installment in the PU Minitour series. This time, each round featured a different OM mashed with PU. Beginning with STABmons, it then moves to Doubles, AAA, Inverse Battles, Monotype, and finally Balanced Hackmons. <a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/smogondoubles-210899201">Here's</a> a battle between GrimoireGod and CharmingMander, showing PU mashed with Doubles.</p>

<h3>Pok&eacute;mon Showdown!</h3>
  <h4>Promotions</h4>
<p>February's promotions: <strong>yoman5</strong>, <strong>aesf</strong>, <strong>jeran</strong> and <strong>Mamp</strong> to Voice; <strong>E4 Flint</strong> to Driver; and <strong>Piccolo</strong> to Mod!</p>
    
    <h4>Seasonal</h4>
<p>A new edition in the <a href="/forums/threads/.3491902/">Seasonal Ladder</a> kicks off this month with Super Staff Bros. The format is based on randbats but all the Pokemon are modeled after the global staff on Showdown and each one has a brand-new, fully-customized move made by that staff member. This can lead to some interesting threats, like <strong>chaos's</strong> /forcewin Bouffalant and <strong>Zarel's</strong> Meloetta with Relic Song Dance. And watch out for your OM Leaders' Pokemon too! <strong>The Immortal</strong> has a regal Blastoise that refuses to give up his crown while <strong>Eevee General's</strong> Eevee is not afraid to commit a few war crimes in order to win.</p>

<p>February's <a href="/forums/threads/.3519142/">Locked Up</a> challenge restricted you from using any Normal-types on your team for the entire month. The top 2 players on the STABmons ladder for the challenge were:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>TTer</strong> &mdash; 1303</li>
    <li><strong>cryalot</strong> &mdash; 1278</li>
</ol>

<p>March's Locked Up is in Balanced Hackmons. We're going back to XY, pre-ORAS! That means no more Pokemon, items, moves, or abilities introduced since then. Good luck!</p>
<h4>Workshop</h4>
<p>On the 21st we held our <a href="/forums/threads/.3530146/">first workshop</a> in the Other Metas room hosted by unfixable, Eevee General, and Pikachuun. We covered the questions listed in the Workshop's thread, like <strong>"What's the difference between an OM and a Pet Mod?"</strong> and <strong>"What are submissions?"</strong> Then we had some battles in AAA, STABmons, and Balanced Hackmons. Here are a few replays:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/almostanyability-212719001">unfixable vs Malagras</a> &mdash; AAA
    <li><a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/balancedhackmons-212719115">Pikachuun vs E4 Fliny</a> &mdash; Balanced Hackmons
    <li><a href="http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/stabmons-212719297">Eevee General vs Jusemeh</a> &mdash; STABmons
</ul>
<p>Tune in next time for another edition of the workshop, TBA later!</p>
