[SHORT DESC]
Prevents freeze. Halves the number of steps required to hatch Eggs.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder cannot be frozen. If the wielder is frozen, it is instantly cured of freeze.</p>

<p>When the wielder is in the party, the Egg counter goes down by two (not one) every 255 steps. This causes Eggs to hatch in half their usual number of steps if they have an even initial Egg count and half + 255 if they have an odd initial Egg count. This effect applies to all Eggs in the party, but the effect does not stack with multiple Magma Armor or <a href="/bw/abilities/flame_body">Flame Body</a> Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Moves capable of freezing have a very low chance of doing so. Moreover, Magma Armor suffers from terrible distribution: only three Pokemon get it, only two of which are fully evolved. <a href="/bw/pokemon/magcargo">Magcargo</a> is useless either way no thanks to its awful Speed, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/camerupt">Camerupt</a> has a better option in <a href="/bw/abilities/solid_rock">Solid Rock</a>. Keep away from this.</p>
