Overview
########

With an incredibly power Mega Evolution, former NU threat Pinsir has soared through the tiers and now finds itself sitting happily in OU. Though its Mega Evolution is the only reason to use Pinsir, with such high power and Speed and a fantastic ability in Aerilate, which changes its Normal-type attacks to Flying-type attacks and grants them a power boost, its Mega Evolution alone is a fantastic reason to put Pinsir on your team. With Aerilate-boosted Quick Attack, Mega Pinsir is also one of only two Pokemon to receive Flying-type priority, which allows it to check a variety of threats and helps it to Mega Evolve more easily. Unfortunately, with its Bug/Flying typing, Mega Pinsir does lose half of its health upon switching into Stealth Rock, but with a large variety of hazard removers in OU, this usually isn't as large of a problem as you might think it would be. Finally, with the want for a boosting move, both Quick Attack and a reliable STAB move, and Earthquake for coverage, Mega Pinsir is fairly predictable and doesn't have much room for other coverage moves.

Moves
========

With Swords Dance, Mega Pinsir uses its fairly unique typing and good natural bulk to try to set up and sweep the opposing team. Thus, Swords Dance is a necessity for Mega Pinsir, and it works very well with Quick Attack. After the Aerilate boost, Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack hits roughly 78 Base Power, and after a Sword Dance, it can be used to take out most of the Pokemon that would be able to revenge kill it. Return is an incredibly powerful STAB attack for Mega Pinsir that has no drawbacks. Finally, Earthquake is used to take on the Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-type Pokemon that could otherwise take a hit from Mega Pinsir. Most notably, Earthquake is able to OHKO Aegislash in its Shield forme at +2.

Set Details
========

Pinsir should never be used seriously in OU without its Mega Evolution, so Pinsirite is the obvious choice for an item. EVs are standard for a physical sweeper, though an Adamant nature can used instead of Jolly in order to OHKO standard Gliscor at +2 with Return and Latias at +2 with Quick Attack. Hyper Cutter is the most reliable choice for an ability on Pinsir in its regular forme, as it keeps Intimidate users such as Landorus-T from lowering its Attack on the switch. Moxie is another viable choice to pick off a weakened foe before Mega Evolving in order to receive an Attack boost.

Usage Tips
========

Pinsir should usually only come into battle later into the game after most of its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened or knocked out. Still, it might be advantageous to bring it in earlier on into the match in order to Mega Evolve and pick off a weakened opponent with Quick Attack. Because its base forme only has base 85 Speed, it's best to Mega Evolve against something it can set up on or something that it can revenge kill with its Quick Attack. Mega Evolving is usually only difficult against more offensive teams that can keep up offensive pressure. Against more defensive teams, you can Mega Evolve earlier on in hopes of wallbreaking with Mega Pinsir. Thanks to its good physical bulk, Mega Pinsir can often set up against physical attackers that do not carry a super effective coverage move, including Breloom without Rock Tomb and Landorus-T without Rock Slide or Stone Edge. However, it's usually going to be easier to set up on a forced switch.

Team Options
========

Some of Mega Pinsir's best counters are things that can lure in its checks and counters. A good example of this is Expert Belt Genesect, which can bluff the Choice Scarf and hit Rotom-Wash with Giga Drain or Energy Ball. Another good partner for this reason is Assault Vest Conkeldurr, which can easily switch into Rotom-Wash and Air Balloon Heatran, as it benefits from being burned and takes little from their attacks, and can threaten them with its Fighting STAB in return. A Rapid Spin or Defog user is another necessary partner for Mega Pinsir, as it relies a lot on its bulk in order to tank faster priority attacks and neutral hits while it sets up. Excadrill is a good parter, as it can use Rapid Spin and deal massive damage to Rotom-Wash with its Mold Breaker Earthquake, and Life Orb Latias can use Defog and Healing Wish to support Mega Pinsir, while also offering a good switch into Rotom-Wash, Thundurus, and Zapdos. Keldeo is another good partner, as it can come in on Rock-, Ice-, and Fire-type attacks very easily, and it threatens all of Mega Pinsir's best checks.

Other Options
########

Close Combat is another option for a coverage move on Mega Pinsir, as it hits Steel- and Rock-types while also being able to do solid damage to Rotom-Wash. However, not being able to touch Aegislash is a very bad thing, and the Defense and Special Defense drops from Close Combat greatly compromise Mega Pinsir's longevity. Thrash can also be used for an incredibly powerful STAB attack, but because Return is already very strong without any negative side effects, it is often the better option. Mold Breaker is also viable on Pinsir to hit Rotom-Wash with Earthquake before Mega Evolving, but this is fairly predictable because it shows the Mold Breaker message upon entering. Bulk Up is usable, but Swords Dance's +2 Attack boost is almost always more beneficial than a +1 Defense boost. Facade would be a decent option on Mega Pinsir if it had to room to fit it on its moveset, as it would keep it from being useless should it become burned, but with each of its four moves being as important as they are, it should very rarely see use. Feint can also be used over Quick Attack in order to hit Talonflame and Weavile, as well as slower Extreme Speed users such as Dragonite and Lucario before it Mega Evolves, before they can hit you, but the lower Base Power makes this less viable than Quick Attack in most situations.

Checks & Counters
########

**Walls that resist Flying and Ground (dunno how else to label this)**: It takes a very specific type of wall to stop Mega Pinsir in its tracks. Pretty much the only Pokemon that keep it from sweeping need to resist both its STAB and its coverage move. Specifically, Rotom-Wash and Skarmory are two of the best answers to Mega Pinsir because they need to be especially weakened if Mega Pinsir hopes to take them out. Though not used as much, Zapdos and Bronzong both fulfill this role as well.

**Priority Users**: Generally, faster priority users make for solid Mega Pinsir checks as well. Talonflame is about as good of an offensive check to Mega Pinsir as you can hope for, as it can outspeed and OHKO with Gale Wings Brave Bird even with an Adamant nature. Weavile is also faster and can use Ice Shard to deal massive damage to Mega Pinsir. Although it isn't a damaging move, Thundurus is able to utilize its faster Prankster Thunder Wave in order to cripple Mega Pinsir, and it can even take one boosted Quick Attack and OHKO with Thunderbolt. Finally, Mamoswine has enough natural bulk to take a boosted Quick Attack and strike back with its own priority Ice Shard.

**Stealth Rock**: Though not quite as solid as the other means of checking Mega Pinsir, if you are able to keep Stealth Rock up throughout the match, Mega Pinsir will be much easier to take out. For offensive teams, this means setting Stealth Rock and keeping up offensive pressure on the opponent throughout the match in order to prevent them from using Rapid Spin or Defog. For more defensive teams, you should either try to take out the opponent's hazard remover or keep setting up Stealth Rock throughout the match.
