Overview
########
- Got a buff with a few new viable toys - Drill Run, Knock Off, and Assault Vest.
- Though losing Ghost- and Dark-type resists, 105 SpD and Assault Vest makes Escavalier a prime candidate of a Pokemon that can take on special attackers such as Gengar.
- Rise of the fairies really gives Escavalier a chance to shine.
- Drill Run and STAB Megahorn, as well as great durability without much investment, gives it an edge over Scizor.
- x4 weakness to Fire-type moves makes it very exploitable as Fire is extremely common in OU.
- Its entire moveset is shut down by Charizard, Talonflame, and Rotom-H.
- Extremely slow despite its Pokedex description of it flying at high speeds.


En Garde!
########
name: En Garde!
move 1: Iron Head
move 2: Megahorn
move 3: Drill Run
move 4: Knock Off / Pursuit
item: Assault Vest
nature: Adamant
ability: Overcoat
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD

Moves
========
- Iron Head is mandatory STAB for Escavalier to hit Clefable, Sylveon, and Togekiss Super Effectively and at least hitting Azumarill for neutral damage.
- Megahorn is Escavalier's strongest STAB and allows it to hit Latias, Latios, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur.
- Drill Run harms switch-ins such as Mega Mawile, Heatran, and Tentacruel.
- Knock Off prevents anyone barring Mega Evolutions like Charizard from being safe switch-ins. Alternatively, Pursuit allows Escavalier to trap threats such as Latias and Latios to aid Keldeo or Mega Charizard Y.

Set Details
========
- Adamant nature with max Attack for tons of damage.
- 248 HP helps with residual damage with the remainder of EVs going to SpD.
- All three of its abilities have great merits.
- Overcoat lets Escavalier block Spore and Sleep Powder from Breloom and Mega Venusaur. It also makes Escavalier immune to Hail to help counter Abomasnow and its Mega Evolution.
- Swarm is great for situations where Escavalier is put into dangerous health levels. This allows Megahorn to hit very hard and practically punish many switch-ins; even those that resist it.
- Shell Armor is the weakest of the three options; however, it completely prevents critical hits in the process.
- With Escavalier's lower HP and higher SpD, it is best to invest in max HP instead of SpD. Below are two calculations for examples:

252 SpA Life Orb Gengar Shadow Ball vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Assault Vest Escavalier: 109-130 (31.6 - 37.7%) -- 90.9% chance to 3HKO
252 SpA Life Orb Gengar Shadow Ball vs. 4 HP / 252 SpD Assault Vest Escavalier: 87-105 (30.8 - 37.2%) -- 78.4% chance to 3HKO

The differences of investing in more SpD is very minor when you also consider Escavalier would appreciate the extra HP to take some physical attacks easier.
- You can try for a bulkier spread, but Escavalier specializes in doing hefty amounts of damage while being utilitarian.
- Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs can be used to have Escavalier run at "high speeds" during Trick Room.

Usage Tips
========
- Assault Vest Escavalier has a dual purpose. Much like Assault Vest Conkeldurr and Assault Vest Tyranitar, the goal is to absorb Special Attacks with relative ease while punishing the opposing Pokemon in the process.
- Some examples of Pokemon that Escavalier can switch into include Greninja, Gengar, Alakazam, Celebi, Espeon, Starmie, Sylveon, and many more. Bear in mind that if any of these Pokemon carry Hidden Power Fire it does make the situation complicated.
- Despite the x4 weakness, un-STAB Fire-type attacks can still be taken from some Pokemon. For example, +1 Flamethrower from bulky Clefable fails to OHKO Escavalier while Iron Head will do 65.9% damage minimum.
- Since Escavalier will force a lot of switches, you may have to predict what is coming out. For example, using Drill Run when Heatran is expected to come in will heavily reward Escavalier and its teammates.


Team Options
========
- Escavalier is not really a Pokemon you build a team around; however, if you desire to think of Pokemon that hate nuisance special sweepers and Ghost-types.
- Keldeo or Mega Charizard Y appreciate Escavalier's capabilities of utilizing Pursuit to eliminate threats such as Latios and Latias.
- Rotom-W is a great partner for handling threats such as Talonflame and Heatran a bit easier. Greninja can be an offensive option that also shuts down tanks such as Hippowdon.
- Charizard is a huge concern for Escavalier because it obtains a free switch-in to any of its attacks. Hippowdon is great as it can somewhat handle both Mega Charizard formes. Goodra and Latias easily take care of Mega Charizard Y while Quagsire is great for handling Mega Charizard X.


Other Options
########
- Swords Dance can boost Escavalier's Attack greatly. Unfortunately, its mediocre movepool and pitiful Speed really hamper it from becoming a major threat with it.
- Choice Band Escavalier isn't a bad choice; however, Assault Vest is probably the best item for Escavalier as it sets it apart from Scizor.


Checks & Counters
########
**Fire-types**: Like many Bug-types, Escavalier is a hot topic for Fire-types as they can easily switch into Escavalier's STAB attacks. Charizard has an added perk of not taking boosted damage from Knock Off while able to scare Escavalier off with its STAB Fire-type attacks. Heatran is capable of taking almost anything Escavalier throws at it barring Drill Run. If Heatran has Air Balloon it can safely switch into Escavalier at least once. Talonflame and Volcarona have to be weary of switching into Knock Off; however, they can easily scare off Escavalier and either boost their stats or attack the next switch-in.

**Physical Walls**: Skarmory easily shrugs off any attack Escavalier throws at it and can either use STAB Brave Bird to dent Escavalier or force Escavalier to take residual damage from Rocky Helmet. Physically defensive Hippowdon takes 40% max from STAB Megahorn and at least wear down Escavalier with STAB Earthquake or Slack Off any damage Hippowdon takes. Zapdos shrugs off the majority of Escavaliers attacks and can target Escavalier with Heat Wave. Be careful when using Roost as Zapdos is prone to both Megahorn and Drill Run.
