[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For three turns, the target cannot avoid any attacks made against it, other than OHKO moves, as long as it remains active. During the effect, the target is immune to Ground-type attacks and the effects of Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and the ability Arena Trap as long as it remains active. If the target uses Baton Pass, the replacement will gain the effect. Ingrain, Smack Down, and Iron Ball override this move if the target is under any of their effects. Fails if the target is already under this effect or the effects of Ingrain or Smack Down. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. This move cannot be used while Gravity is in effect.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Telekinesis has little to no competitive use. Its effect offers no solid benefits that would justify its use, and any uses this move does have are somewhat gimmicky. Though, being able to hit with any move for 3 turns could theoretically be useful on Pokemon that rely on mostly inaccurate moves, such as Alakazam's Focus Blast. Though, the turn that it takes to use Telekinesis could be used instead for a more useful move such as Substitute or Calm Mind.</p>
