[SHORT DESC]
Stops the enemy from lowering this Pokémon's stats. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>This ability blocks any reduction of the Pokémon's stats by the enemy. For instance, Pokémon with Clear Body are immune to Intimidate, but still receive the +2 Attack from Swagger. This does not prevent the Speed drop from Curse, the Attack and Defense drop from Superpower, or any other stat loss caused by the user. It does not block Haze.</p>
