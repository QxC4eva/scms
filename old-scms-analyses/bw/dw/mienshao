[Overview]

<p>Whichever way you look at it, Mienshao is simply <em>fabulous</em>. However, this weasel possesses much more than mere aesthetic grace to back up its claim of being a dangerous threat in the Dream World metagame. Mienshao's base 125 Attack and 105 Speed might make it appear to be yet another run-of-the-mill Fighting-type physical attacker, but it sports a usable base 95 Special Attack stat that allows it to get past would-be counters such as Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice. That's not all: access to a powerful STAB Hi Jump Kick, a fantastic ability in Regenerator, and U-turn make Mienshao a potent hit-and-run attacker that can tear gaping holes in the opponent's team. It even receives Reckless from the Dream World, jacking up the power of Hi Jump Kick to obscene levels. However, the presence of Shadow Tag Chandelure means that Mienshao must exercise extreme caution when using Hi Jump Kick, particularly on a Choice set. Mienshao's poor defensive stats also allow most neutral STAB moves to deal heavy damage if not OHKO. Still, don't let that deter you from using Mienshao; with the proper support, it can run away with games easily.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Mienshao makes for a fantastic scout, momentum grabber, and offensive pivot that can also check some of the top threats in the metagame. Though dedicated leads are rarely used because of Team Preview, Mienshao functions very well as a lead in particular, giving you valuable early-game momentum. This set can be a great addition to dedicated VoltTurn teams, but it also functions as a good team ''glue'' in general. What really sets Mienshao apart from other U-turn users such as Scizor, however, is its access to Regenerator, as it can repeatedly come in, Fake Out for some residual damage, scout the opponent's next move with U-turn, and bring in the appropriate counter, healing off Life Orb recoil and other residual damage with Regenerator.</p>

<p>Mienshao is one of the few fast threats with access to both Fake Out and U-turn, and the combination of these two moves is a potent scouting tool. Fake Out allows Mienshao to inflict ''free'' damage on most threats and pick off weakened faster opponents, also revealing the presence (or absence) of Leftovers recovery. This eases prediction immensely, as you can now judge whether or not Mienshao should switch out or stay in and fire off a powerful Hi Jump Kick. U-turn shifts the momentum in your favor, allowing you to scout the opponent's move and switch to a counter. It also deals heavy damage to Psychic-types such as Starmie and Latias switching in to soak up Hi Jump Kick. Hi Jump Kick is Mienshao's most powerful STAB move: it has an incredible 195 Base Power after STAB, and can 2HKO most neutral foes easily. However, Mienshao will lose 50% of its health if the opponent uses Protect or switches in a Ghost-type, meaning prediction is key when using Hi Jump Kick. This is compounded by the presence of Shadow Tag Chandelure in the metagame, which can trap, outspeed, and OHKO Mienshao if it is running a Choice Scarf. Running Stone Edge in the last moveslot rectifies this issue, as this allows Mienshao to KO Chandelure as it switches in while also destroying threats such as Volcarona. However, if Gliscor is a more problematic foe to your team, you can run Hidden Power Ice instead of Stone Edge to OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage; Mienshao can still escape from Chandelure with U-turn, allowing a teammate such as Tyranitar to trap it with Pursuit.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Mienshao's Attack and Speed, with the 4 remaining EVs invested in Special Defense to ensure that Genesect doesn't obtain a Special Attack boost upon switching in. A Speed-boosting nature is used so that Mienshao gets the jump on threats such as Garchomp, Jirachi, and Genesect while tying with other positive-natured Mienshao. Naive is preferred if Hidden Power Ice is used as Mienshao can still take U-turn and some of the weaker physical priority moves, like Ice Shard; Jolly is used otherwise. Substitute might appear to be a good option for easing prediction, but Mienshao will then have to give up either a coverage move or Fake Out, which will detract from the effectiveness of this set.</p>

<p>Mienshao badly needs bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types out of the way so that it can sweep unhindered with Hi Jump Kick. A strong Pursuit user can help trap and eliminate these checks; Tyranitar comes to mind immediately, as it can trap Chandelure and Jellicent while also dealing with Psychic-types such as Latias. Mienshao isn't bothered by the sand which Tyranitar sets up either, as it has Regenerator to heal off the residual damage. Scizor, while ineffective against Chandelure, destroys Gengar and also packs a powerful STAB U-turn for maintaining offensive pressure and dealing heavy damage to bulky Psychic-types. A fast Choice Scarf user such as Latios or Terrakion can help deal with threats such as Thundurus that outspeed and KO Mienshao; such teammates can also clean up late-game once Mienshao has sufficiently weakened the opposition. Finally, entry hazard users such as Forretress and Ferrothorn also make good teammates, as they can set up entry hazards to ease up several OHKOs and 2HKOs for Mienshao while sponging most powerful attacks from potential counters with their good bulk.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice
move 1: Hi Jump Kick
move 2: U-turn

evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice Scarf, Mienshao functions as a check to powerful boosting sweepers such as Volcarona, Thundurus, and Salamence as well as slower Choice Scarf users such as Genesect while retaining the ability to scout and pile up offensive pressure on the opponent. Unlike other Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, the presence of entry hazards does not particularly impede Mienshao, as it can repeatedly switch in and scout the opponent with U-turn, healing off any damage taken with Regenerator upon switching out. This gives Mienshao valued longevity and thus allows it to function as a offensive pivot for the majority of the game, although it must be careful when switching in as it takes heavy damage at the very least from most neutral STAB moves. Running a Choice Band is also an option, as Mienshao can then function as a wallbreaker that muscles through physical walls such as Skarmory while retaining a high Speed stat thanks to its good base 105 Speed.</p>

<p>Hi Jump Kick is this set's main attraction, and for good reason. Once bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types have been removed, Mienshao can sweep unhindered with Hi Jump Kick, or at the very least, weaken the opposition to a point where its teammates can clean up the remains. U-turn is, as always, a highly useful move to have on a Choice set, gaining momentum and allowing Mienshao to deal heavy damage to Psychic-types switching in to take Hi Jump Kick. Stone Edge OHKOes common Chandelure switch-ins while also allowing Mienshao to take out sweepers such as Dragonite (after Stealth Rock) and Volcarona. Hidden Power Ice is purely for taking out Gliscor as it switches in, allowing Mienshao to sweep with Hi Jump Kick later. It goes without saying that caution should be exercised when using Hidden Power Ice, as Chandelure can still come in after a KO and use Mienshao as setup bait.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Once again, the EV spread maximizes Mienshao's Attack and Speed, with a Naive nature being used so that Hidden Power Ice is not weakened. While it might be tempting to use an Adamant nature, particularly with Choice Band, this is not advised as Mienshao will then be revenge killed easily by Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp. Reckless is an option over Regenerator if you run a Choice Scarf to achieve the OHKO on Keldeo after Spikes damage, but the loss of Regenerator will drastically reduce Mienshao's longevity.</p>

<p>This set's inability to switch moves makes Ghost-types such as Chandelure potent counters, particularly with Hi Jump Kick's deadly side effect. Thus, team support is all the more crucial to Mienshao's success. Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Scizor are once again great partners, as they can trap and eliminate the Ghost- and Psychic-types which act as roadblocks to Mienshao's sweep. Additionally, Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock, enabling Mienshao to net the OHKO on Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice. Bulky physical walls such as Skarmory can also take a Hi Jump Kick and stall for a miss with Roost, meaning wallbreakers such as Salamence pair well with Mienshao. Dragon-types in general make good partners for this set, as they can take advantage of having the opponent's Steel-types removed and sweep with Outrage. Finally, entry hazard support is also highly useful, as it limits switching and weakens walls into Mienshao's KO range. Good candidates for this role include Forretress and Ferrothorn, who can take hits well with their excellent bulk, as well as Deoxys-S, if you are using Mienshao on an offensive team.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Hi Jump Kick
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Baton Pass
item: Life Orb
ability: Regenerator
nature: Naive / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One must not forgot that Mienshao, like most of its Fighting-type brethren, also has access to Swords Dance, allowing it to run a very effective Swords Dance set. Though switching in can sometimes be an issue for Mienshao, it can easily set up a Swords Dance as a Pokemon it threatens, such as Ferrothorn, switches. To give an example of this set's power, Mienshao cleanly OHKOes Skarmory after a Swords Dance. This set works best as a late-game sweeper once faster checks have been eliminated, but unlike many other boosting sweepers, Regenerator gives Mienshao multiple opportunities to set up and attempt a sweep.</p>

<p>Hi Jump Kick is Mienshao's weapon of choice, OHKOing or 2HKOing a large portion of the metagame. Stone Edge gives Mienshao excellent two-move coverage, dealing heavy damage to the Psychic- and Ghost-types that resist or are immune to Hi Jump Kick, respectively; notably, it OHKOes common Chandelure switch-ins attempting to make Mienshao take Hi Jump Kick recoil. The last slot is usually given to Hidden Power Ice for OHKOing Gliscor, which can easily take a boosted Stone Edge and deal heavy damage in return with Earthquake. However, Baton Pass is also an option for the fourth moveslot, catching opponents who expect Mienshao to attack off-guard; it can even free up a moveslot for another physical sweeper to run an additional coverage move.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Mienshao's Attack and Speed, with a Speed-boosting nature to ensure that Mienshao's sweep isn't cut short by threats such as Garchomp and non-Choice Genesect. Naive is used so that Hidden Power Ice isn't weakened; otherwise, Jolly is preferred so as not to further lower Mienshao's poor defenses. Substitute is an option in the fourth moveslot to protect Mienshao from crippling status and ease prediction, also enabling it to take out a faster check that would otherwise revenge kill it. However, Mienshao will find it difficult to set up both Substitute and a Swords Dance, so the given options are almost always better.</p>

<p>Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Scizor make good teammates for Swords Dance Mienshao, as they can eliminate bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Latias, Jellicent, and Reuniclus, that Mienshao cannot break through even after a Swords Dance. Mienshao cannot sweep unless faster threats are removed, so a powerful Choice Scarf user such as Terrakion also pairs well with this set. Stealth Rock and Spikes support makes Mienshao harder to wall, as even walls such as Skarmory are KOed by a boosted Hi Jump Kick after Stealth Rock damage. Additionally, if you are running Baton Pass, a bulky physical attacker such as Lum Berry Dragonite makes an excellent teammate, as it can switch in on most attacks, including status, aimed at Mienshao easily thanks to Multiscale and its good bulk. With a Swords Dance boost Baton Passed to it, Dragonite can weaken the opposing walls to pave the way for Mienshao's sweep or pull off a sweep of its own. Even Ferrothorn makes a good recipient of a Swords Dance boost, as it can easily set up Stealth Rock and Spikes with its good bulk while dealing heavy damage with boosted Power Whips.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While the other sets aim to sweep on their own and apply offensive pressure on the opponent, this set utilizes Mienshao's excellent Speed and mixed offensive stats to support its teammates by luring in and taking out walls and Baton Passing Substitute; this can help a teammate to set up and sweep, even though Mienshao's Substitutes aren't exactly large. Baton Pass teams make excellent use of this set, but it fits in just as well on bulky offense teams with sweepers such as Dragonite and Volcarona that would love having a Substitute to take status and obtain more boosts. However, Mienshao is not limited to only supporting its teammates, as it can still dish out heavy damage with its powerful STAB Hi Jump Kick and thus maintain a strong offensive presence.</p>

<p>Substitute blocks crippling status and eases prediction for Mienshao, enabling it to take a hit and KO back with the appropriate move or Baton Pass to a teammate to maintain momentum; this also makes Mienshao a fine check to VoltTurn teams as it can take stray U-turns even without a Substitute thanks to its resistance. However, leaving Mienshao in on Volt Switch if it doesn't have a Substitute up will be unwise, as it takes heavy damage. Baton Pass maintains momentum and also helps Mienshao to escape from Chandelure as it switches in to trap and KO Mienshao. Hi Jump Kick is Mienshao's best STAB move, hitting anything that doesn't resist it very hard; as mentioned earlier, it gives this set a strong offensive presence and ensures it isn't crippled completely by Taunt.</p>

<p>The last moveslot has two options, and the choice between these two depends on the type of support which you want Mienshao to provide to its teammates. Hidden Power Ice is preferred as it enables Mienshao to lure in and OHKO Gliscor, paving the way for a teammate such as Terrakion to sweep. It also breaks SubDisable Gengar's Substitutes, and with Mienshao's access to Substitute and Baton Pass, Gengar will find it difficult to reliably check it. Running Hidden Power Ice means that Mienshao is walled cold by Chandelure and Jellicent, though; if these Pokemon pose a greater threat to your team, you can run Stone Edge to OHKO the former and deal heavy damage to the latter; Jellicent will thus be forced to use Recover, meaning you can safely bring in a Pursuit user such as Tyranitar and trap it. However, this will greatly reduce the effectiveness of this set as a Gliscor lure, so use Stone Edge only if Gliscor isn't a threat or you have teammates that can take it out easily.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Don't even bother investing any EVs in Mienshao's poor HP or Defense: U-turn from Scizor and Genesect will always break its Substitute, and for that matter, the only major Choice Scarf user which doesn't break Mienshao's Substitute with U-turn is Landorus. Investment in HP will also reduce Mienshao's damage output, so simply maximize Mienshao's Attack and Speed and use a Speed-boosting nature: Naive with Hidden Power Ice, and Jolly otherwise. Using Swords Dance in the last moveslot might seem like a good idea on a Baton Pass team, but this is not advised as Mienshao will then be walled completely by Ghost-types</p>

<p>Even though this set plays the role of a wallbreaker and lure that supports fellow sweepers, it needs some support itself to be effective. Pursuit users such as Scizor and Tyranitar make good teammates as always—particularly if Stone Edge is not used—as they can trap and KO the Ghost- and Psychic-types that trouble this set, including Chandelure. Frail, powerful attackers make excellent recipients of a Substitute: Offensive Gengar is particularly effective, as with a Substitute up, it can take out Ghost- and Psychic-types with ease. Bulky setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Volcarona are also good recipients of a Substitute as they can snag an extra boost or two with their good bulk, which can be game-changing. If you are running Hidden Power Ice, a fast Fighting-type such as Lucario or Terrakion will love having counters such as Gliscor out of the way, allowing them to sweep. Finally, entry hazard support is also of great help, allowing Mienshao to score crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs on walls such as Skarmory. Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Deoxys-S are good options for setting up entry hazards.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Though Mienshao's wide movepool gives it access to to several other moves, most of them are unusable or inferior to the given options in some way. It can run an Endure + Reversal set with a Salac Berry, but Mienshao is very frail, and the ubiquity of sandstorm and priority moves obviously makes this exceedingly difficult to pull off. Acrobatics + Flying Gem is another combination which might appear to be effective, but giving up Life Orb and a coverage move is not a good idea. Drain Punch can be used as a substitute for a STAB move that also provides recovery, but Hi Jump Kick's power is too good to pass up, and besides, Mienshao already has Regenerator for recovery. Mienshao also has access to other physical options such as Payback and Poison Jab, but they are weak and provide redundant coverage. Expert Belt is an option on most sets to bluff a Choice item, but without Life Orb, Mienshao will miss out on the crucial 2HKO on physically defensive Skarmory.</p>

<p>As far as alternative boosting options are concerned, Mienshao has access to Calm Mind and Work Up, which can be put to use with special attacks such as Aura Sphere, Grass Knot, and Hidden Power on a special or mixed set, but such sets are far too weak to be effective. Finally, Bulk Up can be used to boost Mienshao's Defense along with its Attack, but powerful physical attacks from the likes of Terrakion will OHKO Mienshao even after a Bulk Up; such a set is also outclassed completely by the Swords Dance set. However, it must be noted that Mienshao can reliably Baton Pass Bulk Up or Work Up boosts to its teammates with its high Speed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Though solidly countering Mienshao can sometimes be difficult due to its access to U-turn and Baton Pass, there are several Pokemon that easily keep it in check. Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Jellicent come to mind immediately as they can switch in on Hi Jump Kick and cause Mienshao to lose 50% of its health, but the former must be wary of Stone Edge. Still, Choice Scarf Chandelure can trap and eliminate Mienshao as long as it switches in safely; Gengar, while it can't trap Mienshao, outspeeds and OHKOes with Shadow Ball too. Though rare, Golurk walls any Mienshao set without Hidden Power Ice cold, and can set up a Rock Polish as Mienshao switches out. Mienshao's poor defenses also make faster threats great checks as long as it isn't behind a Substitute; these include Latios, Thundurus, Terrakion, and Keldeo. Mienshao can OHKO or 2HKO a large portion of the metagame with its powerful attacks, but bulky attackers such as Latias can take any of its attacks and KO back with a STAB move. Gliscor walls any set without Hidden Power Ice cold and can also take boosted Stone Edge comfortably with its excellent physical bulk, 2HKOing in return with Earthquake. Finally, status such as paralysis or burn will also cripple Mienshao for the rest of the match, making bulky status inducers such as Jellicent and Jirachi great checks.</p>
