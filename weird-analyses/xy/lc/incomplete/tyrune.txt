Overview
########

    Is dino
    Great movepool
    Excellent attack and defense
    excellent check to many fire and flying-types in the tier
    one of the best murkrow checks in particular (lacking icy wind)
    poor speed stat
    weak to many common attacks
    popularity of ice-type coverage (courtesy of gligar) hurts its defensive potential

    Stealth Rock to help support team, best used when forcing switches

Set Details
========

    Eviolite can be used for more increased bulk and works well when it's packed with a wish user
    evs can be customized more physically defensive or specially defensive to check certain threats

Usage Tips
========

    best used on bulky offense teams in need of a flying- and/or fire-type resist
    best brought in mid-game on something it can wall (i.e. fletchling) and then proceed to set up stealth rock
    this set can be used to check / counter murkrow, dwebble, ponyta, fletchling, mantyke, and torchic

Team Options
========

    pairs very well wish spritzee as it can provide wish and aromatherapy support on top of the two being able to cover each other's weaknesses fairly well
    pairs well with other special walls / tanks such as mantyke and croagunk as they can help deal with other things that trouble tyrunt such as meditite and pawniard
    can also work rather well with mienfoo in wearing down the opposing team as well as covering each other fairly decently
    works well with poison-types such as koffing and tentacool as they can deal with fairys and fighting-types
    likes to pair up with pokemon that can take advantage of its shuffling abilities to sweep, so carvanha and bunnelby can also work as effective partners as they also appreciate tyrunt's ability to set up stealth rock and counter fletchling

Other Options
########

    Dragon Dance, though outclassed by dwebble and titrouga as a sweeper
    Choice Scarf, but not the best stabs to be locked into

    Rock Polish
    Curse
    Roar
