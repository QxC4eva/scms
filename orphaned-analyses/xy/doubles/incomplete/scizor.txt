Overview
########
- Very strong Bullet Punch picks off a lot of more frail offensive Pokemon like Skymin, Latios, Deo-A
- Hits Fairies (Aromatisse, Togekiss) and Psychics (Reuniclus, Slowking, Cresselia) for SE STAB, so is p good anti-TR.
- Great bulk when Mevoed makes it a better SD user than last gen
- Can switch in on Dragons even better than before, but dragons are less common

- Very bad neutral coverage
- Setup fodder for Heatran, Thundurus, and Charizard
- Exploitable 4x fire weakness (hidden power)

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move1: Swords Dance
move2: Bullet Punch
move3: Bug Bite
move4: Protect
ability: Technician
item: Scizorite / Lum Berry
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
-Swords Dance is amazing because it overrides scizor's worst enemy: intimidate. ppl think theyre so cute switching in a landog SURPRISE IM +1 BITCHES
-Bullet Punch and Bug Bite provide priority and power respectively, and hit some of the best behemoths in the tier for Super Effective
-Protect because it's goddamn protect
-Superpower can be run in the last slot; superpower greatly improves coverage, problem being if you drop protect youre asking to get fucked by fire moves

Set Details
========
-Trying to maximize damage output, since that's basically what Scizor is there for, and has no real use for Speed investment so HP.
-occa with 204 spd lives hydreis fire blast, thats ridic much spd tho
-Scizorite greatly increases Scizor's bulk and slightly increases his power and Speed so it is the best option for a setup Pokemon.
-If you already have another Mega, you should run Lum Berry, as Scizor is a common WoW target.
-If running mega scizor, 92 Speed is an option so you beat min cress and Rotom-W, which should make you less dependent on team support to outplay their wow/hp fire

Usage Tips
========
-Scizor hardly needs to set up a Swords Dance every time it comes in—his STABs are plenty strong at +0, just use offensive moves until you suspect you'll have a free turn.
-Counteracting the above point, it's wise to SD if you suspect an intimidate is coming your way, because they're not plenty strong at -1
-Be wary of giving free turns to certain Pokemon that don't care about Scizor's STAB—Thundurus, Heatran, Charizard are the big three.
-remove fire types before SDing or it's a wasted turn usually
-Know common HP Fire users (Latios, Shaymin, Cresselia) and if you suspect the team has scizor troubles, scout for it so that you avoid heartbreak.
-It's best to give Scizor free switches as much as possible; save the hard switch-ins for when he really needs to tank a hit for a mate.
-Generally the two biggest team support things are contradictory—you want grasses

Team Options
========
-Obviously Pokemon that beat Fire types handily—Garchomp, Tyranitar, Politoed, et al can not only scare fire types from switching into Scizor but clean up the mess if scizor fucks up.
-Shaymin-Sky can remove Rotom-W and Trevenant, the most common willowisp users, while still carrying EP and Air Slash to not be shit on by tran / zardy respectively
-can work well on semi TR which has problems with Pokemon like Cress that run TR specifically to undo it; full TR is better off with escav usually
-very good on teams lacking in speed control; has bullet punch for faster Pokemon, but also bb and bp to beat common TR setters/abusers
-follow me BUT BEWARE, ALL FM USERS ARE SITTING DUCKS AGAINST FIRE TYPES, GONNA HAVE TO MAKE BALLSY DOUBLE SWITCHES IF U GO DOWN THIS BOULEVARD
-ruins fairies so mons that dont like fairies (esp ones who dont like togekiss's FM support, like Conkeldurr or Hydreigon)

Utility
########
name: Utility
move1: Bug Bite
move2: Bullet Punch
move3: Protect
move4: Feint / Superpower
ability: Technician
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
-Bullet Punch and Bug Bite provide priority and power respectively, and hit some of the best behemoths in the tier for Super Effective
-Protect because it's goddamn protect
-Feint is a great move for offensive teams as it allows them to maintain momentum when the opponent tries to cockblock it through a protect; amazing finisher against low-HP mons.
-Superpower is if your team doesn't make use of feint; patches the biggest hole in its coverage which is Steels

Set Details
========
-a set that almost exclusively uses priority doesn't have much need4speed
-scizorite is still best item but id only do it if i didnt have any other megas i wanted to use on the team since it doesnt need scizorite as bad as sd
-power is maximized so he can do as much damage as possible
-life orb gives even more power while retaining the ability to switch moves
-lum berry keeps that extra 10% health each turn and protects against burns, but the power drop is noticeable (since you have thug bite you should hopefully be able to keep scizor on life support even when lo)
-if you have to ask what the ability is for, kill urself
-if superpower, might try to ev to outspeed tran but it's hard to actually know how much spe tran is running since it creeps like a motherfucker so don't

Usage Tips
========
-doesn't ohko much of anything, is better for just finishing the job
-Fortunately a lot of this guy's usefulness doesn't come from his raw power; even at -1 and burned he can still break protects and chip in that last 5% and steal sitrus berries
-however it is best to double switch out of intimidates and avoid burns
-try to avoid being switch fodder for fire- and steel-types by staying on your toes and playing scizor as a hit-and-run or only partnering him with pkmn that beat those things

Team Options
========
-more than anything else, Trick Room appreciates feint support, and scizor is slow enough to function in it, just make sure you drop IVs to 0 spe
-things that can cover scizor's fire-type weakness—chomp, zygarde, ttar, toed
-as above, teams that lack speed control

Other Options
########
-occa berry sounds fun but scizor would still die to most fire moves lol
-swords dance->aerialace gg
-roost would be nice but what moveslot do you replace lol, protect on sd megazor at the very best
-tailwind
-knock off
-quick guard
-light screen
-U-turn (is this viable enough for an alternate mention on utility set? only if lum tho)

Checks and Counters
########
-fire types (talobird, tran, zardy, volc, rotomh) don't fear its STAB and threaten a KO
-Steel types / Thundurus don't fear its STAB; can't do as much directly back but can set up / troll sciz's partner
-intimidate beats non-SD scizor, but switching to an intimidator just gives SDzor a free turn
-will-o-wisp but beware of lum
-scizor's not THAT bulky so he'll usually fall to a few strong neutral hits
-bulkier pokemon that can do decent damage or burn it (waters often)
