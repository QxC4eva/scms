<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The target's Defense stat, and not its Special Defense, is used in damage calculation. All other factors work as expected.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Secret Sword, the signature move of Keldeo, is a great addition to the little pony's movepool. Secret Sword's effect of hitting the opponent's physical defense means that the premier special walls, Chansey and Blissey, have no chance whatsoever of walling Keldeo, despite its somewhat middling Base Power.</p>
