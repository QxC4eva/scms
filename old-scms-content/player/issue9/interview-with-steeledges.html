            <p><em>I was actually looking forward to this interview for a change. Word on the street was that girls were teaming up in multiple parts of America to win the Player's interview poll, so I imagined slumber parties and some more action for myself, if you know what I mean. I was ready for the interview, with my cologne and polo shirt, when suddenly I got a call from Antemortem.</em></p>
            <p><em>"Change of plans; seems like that guy SteelEdges pulled ahead&mdash;you    're headed for Kentucky."</em></p>
            <p><em>Looks like I won't be needing that cologne, I thought, but I didn't mind interviewing him; I'd heard he's an interesting guy. I ran out the door and hit the first plane to Kentucky, which got delayed quite a bit, so I ended up sitting there wondering what could've been. Soon I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky, and Steel did warn me that people in Kentucky had some confusing pronunciation. To prove this, I was greeted with a "Hoe der ya do?" Oh boy, this was gonna be a long day.</em></p>

        <div>
            <p>Hey, Steel! Nice to meet you.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>Hello, Spy. I'm glad to see you as well. Sorry, it's a bit snowy right now.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>Yeah, we've been getting quite a bit of snow back in New Jersey as well. Regardless, how is it in Kentucky? What kind of person would you consider yourself irl?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>I live just outside of Louisville in a historic small town&mdash;lots of museums, old buildings, that kind of stuff. I just moved to another neighborhood last year and got finished with a community theater production two months ago. I'm trying out again next month.
 
            What kind of person am I? That's a good question. I consider myself fairly open and creative. I like to write, read&mdash;I've paid the local library over $200 in replacement cards and lost books&mdash;and research new things.
 
            Mostly, that research consists of Googling interesting things, but it's fun.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>That's pretty interesting! There's an unlimited amount of knowledge out there for us to grab. Other than community theater, what else do you enjoy to do?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>Well, video games and spending time with friends are also great&mdash;if I can get a ride to Louisville, I love going to pub trivia. I've never won, but one time my brother, father, and I came in second&mdash;we'd have won if we had wagered five more points on the final question.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
    <p>Do you remember that question?
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>Yes. I do. You had to rank in order:</p>
 
 
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What number on the top 20 magazines in sales is Oprah's magazine?</li>
                    <li>How many airline crashes in the first decade of the 2000s killed over 100 people?</li>
                    <li>How many Popes served in the 20th century?</li>
                    <li>And something about the Super Bowl.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
 
            <p>Somehow, we got it in order. We bet low, thinking everyone else would get it wrong&mdash;they all did, but the people in the lead only wagered one point.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="aside">
        <div>
            <p><em>The fact that he could remember the question from so long ago was enough proof of how smart he was; I can barely remember what happened last night.</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>Haha, that seems tough. Since you seem so intellectually talented, how did you manage to stumble across a place like PS?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>I was a Mod on another Pok&eacute;mon simulator for about a year, then quit. I'd been coming onto PS to talk to a friend of mine and play random battles. I became Voice through chatting sometimes, and was offered Driver about a month later.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>I assume that other Pok&eacute;mon simulator was PO. How was PO compared to PS? It's quite a known fact that you used to be a Mod there as well.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>Yes, it was PO. I enjoyed it, but I just felt burned out&mdash;I'd made some mistakes and I didn't think I should be there anymore. I still visit and keep in touch with my friends there, though.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="aside">
        <div>
            <p><em>From what I've heard, PO and PS are quite different, I wonder what it's like on the other side of the fence.</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>You've been involved with quite a few rooms since joining PS. How has that experience been?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>I like owning rooms. It's more rewarding than muting trolls in the Lobby, for one. Leading and shaping a community, planning events, training auth&mdash;that's a lot more fun for me, personally.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>What's been your favorite room to lead so far?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>Academics. I love the community (RIP Ruine), and it's always fun to plan games such as Jeopardy.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>Regardless of how you enjoy leading rooms, you're also often seen in Lobby muting nerds. How does it feel to be one of the most feared yet liked Moderators on PS?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>I suppose it comes with being one of the older Mods. I try not to let the power go to my head.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="aside">
        <div>
            <p><em>An honorable reputation indeed.</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>You definitely are one of the oldest Mods around here. Why do you enjoy PS, and what has kept you here for so long?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>Really, I have a lot of friends here, and I love helping users, making projects, and occasionally losing at random battles.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>Do you have any future plans for PS and/or Smogon?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>I'm working on Spelling Bae (yes, bae is deliberate) for Academics and an unnamed team project for Trivia. I just stepped down from Tournaments and would like to get involved with some smaller rooms.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>Ah yes, speaking of Tournaments. You're still RO of the new private room Indigo Plateau. How'd you think of the idea for the room, and what are your thoughts/future plans for it?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>I don't really remember where the idea came from, to be honest! As for what's going on with it, I'm probably going to raise the GXE required and implement a ladder challenge.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker spydreigon">
        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>Yeah, the room has been a fairly big success so far. Every time I enter the Tournaments room I get spammed with requests for access! Anyway, to end things off, I must ask: Who the hell is the Perilous Pundit, and why should we care about anything he says?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>The Perilous Pundit is a bastion of light and goodness in a world of darkness. He brings hope to the desperate, fearful masses. He is the alpha and the omega, the A and the Z, and as soon as the case is settled he can write again.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="aside">
        <div>
            <p><em>I could feel a shadow looming over me, as if I had said something wrong.</em></p>

        <img src="/player/issue5/interview_spy.png" alt="Spydreigon" />
        <div>
            <p>Truly inspiring. Anyways, something tells me my time here is up. It was a pleasure talking to you!
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="interview-speaker steeledges">
        <img src="/player/issue1/interview_steel.png" alt="SteelEdges" />
        <div>
            <p>The same to you.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <div class="aside">
        <div>
            <p><em>I quickly exited the building and flew out of the state as fast as I could. That shadow, and the literacy rates of the people there, were just too much for me to handle, but I guess it's no better than my high school.</em></p>
