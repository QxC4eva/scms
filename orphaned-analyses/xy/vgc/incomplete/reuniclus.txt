####Overview####

In VGC 13' Reuniclus was overshadowed by Cresselia with its larger bulk and better supportive movepool, but now with the new rule set it's Reuniclus turn to shine. While it bulk is not as good as Cresselia, it's still solid enough to take hits. While its supportive move-pool is there, it's offensive are better then Cressila with its solid 125 Sp.Atk. With the upgrade of Overcoat, Reuniclus is now immune to Spore and Sleep powder something other Trick Room pokemon wish they had. While Reuniclus may not be as bulky, good, or as used as Cresselia it will be the defensive psychic-type everyone will consider.

Moves
==========

This is what set Reuniclus apart from a Trick Room Cresselia is that Reuniclus had much higher attack.
This is made to set up Trick Room and then hit with solid damage. Trick Room is made to set up Trick Room and let Reuniclus go first. Psychic over Psyshock debate, Psychic is stronger but Psyshock hit specially defensive harder like Amoonguss. Focus Blast lets you hit Dark-types but more importantly hit Tyranitar, something Cresselia couldn't do. The move slot is to what you want to cover. Shadow Ball hit other Psychics and Ghosts and also giving perfect coverage with Focus Blast. Energy Ball is for common Rotom-W and other Water-types. Hidden Power Fire is to to hit Scizor.

Set Details
==========

The EVs are copied from the VGC 13' set. This spread gives overall more bulk than 252 Hp EVs could. The 252 Sp.Atk Evs is fairly obvious. The set job is to set up Trick Room and start breaking down Pokemon for the partner to finish off or to perform the KO itself. The moves are chosen to cover common threat in the game. Life Orb if you need more power plus taking no recoil with Magic Guard is nice. While Overcoat prevent Amoonguss from ruining your day.

Usage Tips
==========

This set is used as a bulky offensive Trick Room setter you should use it as such. Use Reuniclus to wither down Pokemon for the other to finish. Pokemon with Taunt exist so plan according. This is not sweeper, more like a wall-breaker so don't just let it go. Team support is need for this set to work perfectly. It primary job is to set up Trick Room, and still hold a offensive presence.

Moves
==========

Much like the first set more more focus on the bulk. Trick Room is there to set like always. The always debated Psychic vs. Psyshock, like above it depend on what you need it for. Helping Hand is for a more supportive approach boosting its ally's power to attack. Snatch can be used if you can predict correctly you can steal one of the opponents' boosts. The last option is used to either attack for more coverage or set up a screen to protect your allies.

Set Details
==========

The above spread allows Reuniclus to survive all kinds of attacks and set up Trick Room Calculations
252 SpA Mega Gengar Shadow Ball vs. 252 HP  48 SpD Reuniclus 182-216 (83.8 - 99.5%)
252+ Atk Mega Tyranitar Crunch vs. 252 HP  140+ Def Reuniclus 174-206 (80.1 - 94.9%)
252+ Atk Technician Mega Scizor Bug Bite vs. 252 HP  140+ Def Reuniclus 182-216 (83.8 - 99.5%)
252+ Atk Aegislash-Blade Shadow Claw vs. 252 HP  140+ Def Reuniclus 144-170 (66.3 - 78.3%)
Because of the more focus on bulk, Sitrus Berry is used to recover some of its health and Overcoat to protect from Spore and Sleep powder preventing any unwanted crippling. Due to its more supportive nature Mental herb can be used to stop an Taunt and guarantee a Trick Room.

Usage Tip
==========

While this would be overlook as insuperior to Cressielia, due to it non-existence in the tier Reuniclus can take its spot as a bulky supportive Trick Room setter. Use this like you use Cresselia to absorb the hit and support its allies.It attacks still deal a solid amount of damage but focus more on supporting the team.
