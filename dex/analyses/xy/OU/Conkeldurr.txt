Overview
########

Conkeldurr is a prime example of a bulky Fighting-type. Its base 105 HP and 95 Defense make it a difficult opponent to take down physically. Though its Special Defense is low, it is remedied by the introduction of Assault Vest in Generation VI - boosting its Special Defense to a possible stat of 343 with a neutral nature. Access to STAB Drain Punch keeps Conkeldurr healthy while Mach Punch offers Conkeldurr extra utility that many Fighting-types wish they could have access to. Its stellar physical movepool to compliment its base 140 Attack and three awesome abilities makes Conkeldurr a big threat to many teams that don't take it into account.

Though Generation VI has brought a lot of great things to Conkeldurr such as Assault Vest, a buff to Knock Off, a nerf to many common special attacks' base power, and the disappearance of permanent weather not all is sunshine and rainbows for our concrete-holding friend. The introduction of Fairy-type has given Conkeldurr another weakness as well as another type that resists its STAB Fighting-type attacks. Furthermore, Conkeldurr has to face a power creep with the introduction of Mega Evolutions as well as new threats such as Talonflame. While Conkeldurr's low Speed can be a major boon to Trick Room as well as utilizing Drain Punch it can leave Conkeldurr susceptible to being revenge killed by faster threats. With Conkeldurr's mesh of abilities and attacks as well as great durability proves that Conkeldurr's stone slabs are not just for show.

Moves
========

Drain Punch is the primary attack in this set as it keeps Conkeldurr healthy as well as provide Conkeldurr with a STAB Fighting-type attack to compliment its base 140 Attack stat. Mach Punch is very useful as it can close gaps on Poklemon that Conkeldurr falls short on KOing as well as provide Conkeldurr utility in revenge killing threats such as Lucario and Mega Gyarados. Knock Off's buff allows it to harass opponents by knocking off their crucial items such as Leftovers and Assault Vest while giving Conkeldurr ways of dealing with Psychic- and Ghost-types such asand Gengar. Ice Punch really compliments Conkeldurr well by hitting Pokemon that would commonly switch into Conkeldurr such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. Stone Edge is also a great move as it can prevent Gyarados, Charizard, and Pinsir from switching into Conkeldurr and taking advantage of its movepool.


Set Details
========

Assault Vest is this set's primary item as it raises Conkeldurr's Special Defense greatly; especially when Conkeldurr invests all of its EVs into Special Defense. Though many may question on investing fully into Special Defense instead of splitting the EVs into HP or even investing in full HP, this set's primary goal is to sponge special attacks better while utilizing Drain Punch for recovery. Adamant and max Attack allow Conkeldurr to be a punishing threat on top of its already great durability. Guts is the preferred ability as it allows Conkeldurr to switch into status moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Thunder Wave while making Scald and Lava Plume's burn a detriment to the opponent. If you can play around status Iron Fist is an okay option as it boosts most of Conkeldurr's attacks. Though Conkeldurr's EV spread can be played around with a spread of 200 HP / 252 Attack / 56 SpD provides a balance of defenses while still maximizing Attack.


Usage Tips
========

By far Conkeldurr's greatest set in Generation 6 as this set specializes in what Conkeldurr is known for - hefty hits while tanking hits. Assault Vest Conkeldurr is great because, with Guts, it absorbs status while tanking damage and hitting like a bulldozer through a forest. Conkeldurr is not necessarily a Pokemon that you build a team around. Conkeldurr is mostly a team player and can adjust its final move to cater the team and their needs. As Guts is a great ability to take advantage of switching into threats such as Rotom-W, Chansey, and Heatran are highly recommended. Thanks to Assault Vest and STAB Drain Punch switching into these threats is of little concern.

Prediction is very crucial when using this set. Firing repeated STAB Drain Punches can be detrimental to Conkeldurr as it can give opportunities for your opponent to switch into threats such as Latios, Landorus, and Landorus-T. In this case it is best to attempt to predict the opponent's next move such as a switch into Landorus-T and punish the opponent with Ice Punch. Knock Off is a great tool in scouting opponent's moves and even the opponent's Mega Evolution as the Mega Stone will not be knocked off the opponent. Denying the opponent items such as Leftovers and Assault Vest can really help Conkeldurr and its teams turn the tides of battle by making KOes easier to land.



Team Options
========

As stated before the Assault Vest set isn't really a sweeper and focuses more on being a team player. Conkeldurr is troubled by many threats - in particular Fairy-types such as Clefable and Azumarill as well as physical walls such as Hippowdon and Mega Venusaur. Depending on the final attack can also determine what will trouble Conkeldurr more - without Ice Punch Gliscor and Landorus-T become bigger issues while lacking Stone Edge introduces Charizard and Gyarados as major threats. Kyurem-B is great as it can shut down the majority of the threats that trouble Conkeldurr thanks to STAB Ice Beam and access to Fusion Bolt. Mega Venusaur is also a great partner as it can harass many Fairy-types with STAB Sludge Bomb and its typing. Mega Venusaur also appreciates threats such as Heatran being harassed by Conkeldurr. Heatran can also be a great teammate for Conkeldurr as Conkeldurr helps handle threats such as Rotom-W while Heatran can help against Mega Mawile. Heatran provides Conkeldurr with Stealth Rock while easily mocking Clefable and Sylveon. Heatran can also spread burns and / or Toxic on opponents to help wear down threats.

Pivots such as Landorus-T and Scizor can be great for Conkeldurr. Landorus-T can provide Stealth Rock and help check threats such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Mawile while Scizor can utilize STAB Bullet Punch to smash in Fairy-types and other fast sweepers that resist Mach Punch such as Mega Pinsir. Rotom-W is another great teammate as it can provide Will-O-Wisp to soften physical attackers while handling threats such as Azumarill decently. As passive damage such as Stealth Rock and Spikes can be alarming to Conkeldurr's health Excadrill can spin away entry hazards while laying its own.


Other Options
########

The amount of other options Conkeldurr has to consider is about as immense as the stone slabs it holds. For moves there are many to consider. Poison Jab is Conkeldurr's only weapon against Fairy-types; however, Mega Mawile is completely immune to Poison Jab and the coverage it provides with Conkeldurr's other moves is mediocre. Earthquake is Guts Conkeldurr's best move against Mega Mawile. Conkeldurr can utilize Bulk Up to boost its already impressive Attack and Defense, but Conkeldurr has a difficult time sacrificing one of its attacks. Sheer Force can be used with Life Orb and boosts Rock Slide, Ice Punch, and Poison Jab. Alternatively, Iron Fist can be used to boost many of its attacks including Focus Punch and Hammer Arm. Hammer Arm is great with Trick Room as the Speed drop makes Conkeldurr faster. Finally, Toxic Orb and Flame Orb are possible items to consider when using Guts. While these items power up Conkeldurr immediately the loss of Leftovers or Assault Vest is a huge detriment to Conkeldurr and its survival.


Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: The main bane to our concrete-wielding friend are the cute Fairy-types. Mega Mawile, Clefable, and Azumarill are major issues for Conkeldurr as it does not often carry Poison Jab nor Earthquake. Mega Mawile and Azumarill will scare off Conkeldurr with STAB Play Rough while Clefable can use STAB Moonblast to send Conkeldurr back into its Pokeball.

**Physical Walls**: Skarmory, Hippowdon, Mega Venusaur, and sometimes Gliscor can prove difficult for Conkeldurr to get around. Hippowdon can easily Slack Off any damage Conkeldurr inflicts while phazing out Conkeldurr with Whirlwind. Skarmory has access to STAB Brave Bird to scare off Conkeldurr; however, bear in mind that Skarmory must stay healthy to keep Conkeldurr checked as Guts-boosted Drain Punch can do 73% minimum while Skarmory is using Roost. Thanks to Thick Fat Mega Venusaur takes neutral damage from Ice Punch while resisting Conkeldurr's STAB Fighting-type attacks. Mega Venusaur can use STAB Sludge Bomb to wear out Conkeldurr and stay healthy with Synthesis. Without Ice Punch Gliscor can become a major nuisance as it can use Substitute, Protect, and Toxic to stall out Conkeldurr without taking much damage, if any, in the process.

**Fighting-type Resistant Attackers**: A plethora of these Pokemon can either switch into Conkeldurr or check Conkeldurr from getting very far. Mega Charizard Y can switch into Conkeldurr that lack Stone Edge and do massive damage with Drought-boosted Fire Blast or STAB Air Slash. Volcarona hates Knock Off and Stone Edge; however, bulky Volcarona can take advantage of Conkeldurr and set up multiple Quiver Dances and use Roost to recover the damage taken. Mega Pinsir can switch into non-Stone Edge Conkeldurr easily and threaten off Conkeldurr with STAB Return. Mega Pinsir should be weary of using Swords Dance as Ice Punch will do a lot of damage after Pinsir Mega-Evolves.
