Boosts evasion by 2 stages.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's evasion by two stages. After using this move, Stomp and Steamroller will have their power doubled if used against the user while it is active.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Since the Evasion Clause exists in most Smogon metagames, Minimize has no use outside of Ubers. Even in Ubers, it is rarely seen due ot its limited distribution and is fairly unreliable. The presence of perfect-accuracy Thunder (in the rain) and Aura Sphere also decrease its usefulness, especially since most users of Minimize are weak to one of these moves. The only Pokemon that can make decent use of it is Drifblim because it can Baton Pass the evasion boosts to teammates to set up a sweep. However, it itself requires some Speed boosts to function properly, and it must be wary of incoming Thunder. The other Pokemon with access to the move are either too weak for the metagame or cannot afford to give up enough valuable moveslots to make a Minimize set work.</p>
