[Overview]

<p>As with its Rock / Steel brethren, Probopass and Bastiodon, Lairon is a very unbalanced Pokemon in both stats and typing. While it—like its evolutionary family—was blessed with a monstrous Defense stat, it was also cursed with a terrible typing that gives it glaring weaknesses to the two most common physical attacking types, Ground and Fighting. Unlike its counterparts, however, Lairon can use the Eviolite item, which both boosts its excellent Defense to dizzying heights and turns its terrible Special Defense into something usable. Like its brother Aggron in RU, Lairon also wields a mighty recoil-free Head Smash that can dent most walls and destroy any Pokemon weak to it. In addition, Lairon can stray from its normally defensive roles and surprise the opposition with a boosting Autotomize set. When coupled with Head Smash, it can easily destroy a tier that is largely weak to Rock-type attacks. Using Lairon effectively always requires careful maneuvering around its weaknesses, but it can easily pull its weight whether it is supporting your team with its massive defenses or shattering your opponent with its formidable Head Smash.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When running physically defensive investment along with Eviolite, Lairon's Defense skyrockets to levels that dwarf even standard physical walls such as Tangela and Alomomola, letting it even survive powerful 4x super effective attacks, such as Adamant Torterra's Earthquake and Choice Scarf Sawk's Close Combat. Stealth Rock is a must-have on any team and fits well on Lairon, who can reliably set it up due to its incredible bulk. Head Smash is a great move for Lairon as well, as it is recoil-free and can do a lot of damage thanks to the STAB boost and Lairon's base 90 Attack. Earthquake completes a pseudo-EdgeQuake combo with Head Smash and can take down Fire- and Rock-types; however, Toxic can be used to cripple walls such as Alomomola, who can't Toxic Lairon in return thanks to its Steel typing. Roar is used in the last slot to phaze out threatening setup sweepers such as Torterra, as well as scout for switch-ins and rack up hazard damage when paired with Stealth Rock.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Lairon's HP and Defense are maximized along with a Impish nature to give it maximum physical bulk, letting it survive almost any unboosted physical hit. Eviolite is the lynchpin of Lairon's success and without it, Lairon is easily taken down; Trick and Knock Off users are a constant threat to Lairon as they can easily rob it of its valuable item. Rock Head is a great ability for Lairon as it removes recoil from Head Smash, but Sturdy can be used instead to make sure Lairon can survive a hit at full HP and possibly Roar out a powerful sweeper. Unfortunately, the prevalence of entry hazards and the lack of Leftovers preventing Lairon from regaining Sturdy makes this option hard to pull off successfully. Iron Head can be used over Earthquake for a secondary STAB move, but it has poor super effective coverage and is often weaker than Head Smash.</p>

<p>Flying-types make excellent teammates for Lairon, as they resist Fighting-type attacks and are immune to Ground-type moves. Golbat in particular is an outstanding choice as it is one of the few bulky Flying-types in the tier and has great synergy with Lairon. Misdreavus is also an excellent partner to Lairon as it is immune to the Fighting and Ground moves that hit Lairon for 4x super effective damage.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Lairon's stat spread might make a specially defensive set seem ridiculous, Eviolite allows it to take weaker and resisted special moves with aplomb after significant investment. This Lairon trades insane physical bulk for a more equalized stat distribution and works well in checking a greater variety of threats. Stealth Rock is an excellent move for any team to have, and it should always be used on Lairon unless another team member is running the move. Head Smash lets Lairon take down frail threats and can even threaten walls such as Golbat and Shelmet. Roar enables Lairon to remove threatening sweepers that would otherwise set up on it, while also scouting for switch-ins and accumulating hazard damage. Earthquake allows Lairon to hit the Steel- and Fighting-types that resist Head Smash, but Toxic can be used if you find Lairon needs a way to take down physical walls such as Alomomola.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>In order to boost Lairon's poor Special Defense to decent levels, full investment in Special Defense and HP is required, as is a Careful nature. Eviolite is once again the only item Lairon should use, but be aware that even with it, super effective special attacks can take Lairon down. However, a STAB recoil-less Head Smash—thanks to Rock Head—can easily threaten most of the tiers special sweepers, including Magmortar. Iron Head can be used but, again, it has redundant coverage with Head Smash and is quite weak overall. Lairon can also use Body Slam to spread around paralysis and slow down the opponent's team, letting Lairon smash them with Head Smash.</p>

<p>Flying-types and Levitating Ghost-types are once again great partners for Lairon as they can take the Fighting- and Ground-type moves that Lairon hates with little to no consequence. Lairon can also take the Ice-type attacks that trouble Flying-types while Dark- and Ghost-type attacks directed at its Ghost-type teammates bounce off Lairon's steel exterior.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although defensive Lairon is arguably outclassed by Bastiodon and Probopass, it is with an offensive set that Lairon can distinguish itself from its fellow Rock- and Steel-types. Its base 90 Attack isn't too shabby and is more than compensated for by the high Base Power of Head Smash. Autotomize boosts Lairon's terrible Speed to decent levels and lets Lairon go for a sweep. Head Smash is its main offensive move and differentiates itself from other Rock Polish sweepers such as Camerupt. Head Smash hits most Pokemon ridiculously hard, especially as a large amount of Pokemon in NU are weak to Rock-type attacks. Earthquake hits all Pokemon that resist Head Smash for at least neutral damage, with Torterra being the only notable exception. Iron Head is a reliable STAB move that never misses and has a good chance to flinch the opponent after a Speed boost.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Adamant is the nature of choice to give Lairon the most attacking power after full EV investment in Attack and Speed; however, Jolly can be used to let Lairon outrun Pokemon such as Swoobat. In general, though, it is not worth the reduction in power.</p>

<p>Fighting- and Ground-types are Lairon's greatest enemies, so Flying-types and Levitating Ghost-types, such as Golbat and Misdreavus are once again Lairon's best partners. A dual screen user such as Gardevoir can aid in Lairon's sweep by setting up screens to safeguard Lairon from powerful hits and let it set up safely.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Lairon doesn't really have much in the way of other options. A Choice Band set is usable; although it sacrifices most of Lairon's bulk, the payoff can be huge. Double-Edge also benefits from Rock Head but provides no significant coverage alongside Head Smash, as it is also ineffective against Rock- and Steel-types. Metal Burst can catch your opponent by surprise, but it can only work once, and Lairon will often be easily picked off afterwards. Lairon can also set up Sunny Day and Rain Dance for your team, but it is completely outclassed in this role by many of the NU tier's Pokemon.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Golurk is arguably the best Lairon counter in the tier because it takes little damage from any of Lairon's attacks and can easily OKHO it back or set-up a Substitute. Torterra is also one of the better Lairon checks; it is only really troubled by Toxic or multiple Iron Head flinches, and can then reply with a devastating Earthquake that OHKOes all but the most physically defensive Lairon. Gurdurr laughs at Lairon's attempts at dealing damage and can set up Bulk Up boosts in Lairon's face before finishing it off with Drain Punch. Additionally, status from Toxic or Body Slam only helps to make Gurdurr stronger thanks to its Guts ability. Weezing can also counter Lairon; although it can be worn down with entry hazards and multiple Head Smashes, it can burn Lairon with Will-O-Wisp, preventing it from posing much of a threat. Specially based Water-types such as Gorebyss can easily deal with defensive Lairon, while Pokemon that use Hidden Power Fighting or Hidden Power Ground as a coverage move, such as Haunter, will also have little trouble getting past Lairon. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola and Tangela can sponge multiple Head Smashes from the offensive set, but are very vulnerable to Toxic, and can do little back to Lairon aside from whittling it down with Leech Seed and Waterfall.</p>

<p>Any Choice Scarf holder with more than base 70 Speed can outspeed a +2 Lairon, but will be hard-pressed to OHKO a healthy Lairon except with a super effective attack. Choice Scarf Sawk can easily tank any attack Lairon uses and OHKO it back with Close Combat. Lastly, Taunt from the likes of Misdreavus disables defensive sets, but frail Taunt users such Murkrow must be careful of Head Smash.</p>
