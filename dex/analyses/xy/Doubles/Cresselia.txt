########
name: Support

move 2: Helping Hand

move 4: Rest / Protect
ability: Levitate
item: Chesto Berry / Leftovers
evs: 240 HP / 12 Def / 60 SpA / 196 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========
- Icy Wind is a great spread move for speed control so that your partner will be able to outspeed. Thunder Wave is also useful for speed control and you can also have that occasional 33% paralysis hax.
- STAB Psyshock hits Hitmontop and Venusaur hard and is useful against specially defensive walls. Moonblast can also be a viable option as it is 4x super-effective against Scrafty and gives Cresselia the ability to deal decent damage to Dark-types.
- Helping Hand assists in giving your partner Pokemon a 1.5x boost, which can be lethal in most situations.
- ChestoRest can keep Cresselia alive for a longer period of time for further support. Protect is convenient against incoming super-effective attacks such as Shadow Ball and Crunch, and also gives Cresselia a free turn to restore health when using Leftovers.

Set Details
========
- Calm Nature with 240 HP and 196 SpD EVs allow Cresselia to be a specially defensive wall that's difficult to take down. Can take 4 hits of Heat Wave from Timid Char-Y in Sun.
- 60 SpA EVs lets Cresselia 2HKO Max HP Hitmontop and Venusaur, while guaranteeing inflicted 80% damage against Landorus-Therian and Garchomp. Invested the remaining EVs in defense for a little added bulk.
- Chesto Berry + Rest lets Cresselia live longer for further support. Leftovers is a solid alternate option together with Protect for a free turn for restoring HP.

Usage Tips
========
- Main purpose of this set is for support and to provide partner Pokemon with speed advantage and added offensive firepower.
- Cresselia is also extremely useful in switching into most incoming attacks thanks to her impressive bulk.
- Cresselia usually slows the opposing team down with Icy Wind until her partner is able to outspeed. She then proceeds to spam Helping Hand to assist her partner in dealing major damage.
- Psyshock and Moonblast should only be used if it is super effective against the opposing Pokemon or if it is close enough to KO.

Team Options
========
- This set is most effective on offensive teams looking for a little bulk and speed advantage to be able to outspeed and sweep.
- Sweepers such as Mega-Kangaskhan, Mega-Mawile, Landorus, Mega-Charizard Y, Heatran, Azumarill and Keldeo enjoy speed control.
- Cresselia can virtually fit into any team looking for support.
- Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Scrafty are a good partner, as they can eliminate Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon who pose a threat to Cresselia. Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame are also useful for taking care of Scizor and Mega-Mawile.
- Earthquake users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp can EQ away thanks to Levitate.

Trick Room
########
name: Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Psyshock / Moonblast
move 3: Reflect / Helping Hand
move 4: Protect / Light Screen
ability: Levitate
item: Mental Herb / Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Sassy

Moves
========
- Trick Room allows the slower Pokemon to move first, which helps make slow sweepers gain the advantage.
- STAB Psyshock hits Fighting-types pretty hard, but Moonblast enables Cresselia to deal decent damage to Dark-types, notably Scrafty.
- Helping Hand gives the partner Pokemon a significant attack boost, most preferably the Trick Room sweeper.
- Protect is useful for incoming super-effective attacks, although Light Screen or Reflect gives the team a little added bulk, depending on what defense stat necessary for a boost.
- Both Reflect and Light Screen can interchange in each other's move slots; it depends on what your team benefits from the most.

Set Details
========
- Sassy Nature plus 0 Speed IVs allow Cresselia to function effectively in Trick Room.
- Mental Herb guarantees that Trick Room will be set up, as Taunt will be ineffective.
- 252 HP and 80 Def EVs lets Cresselia take three Knock Offs from Adamant Max Attack Scrafty and three Brave Birds from Adamant Max Attack LO Talonflame.
- Light Clay is also a great option as Reflect and Light Screen are extended to 8 turns which can provide your team with significant bulk.
- Sitrus Berry is an effective alternative if you want to increase Cresselia's durability.

Usage Tips
========
- The best way to use Trick Room Cresselia is in, well, Trick Room. Protect with your partner Pokemon, and set up Trick Room with Cresselia.
- Attempt to keep Cresselia and a partner sweeper alive for a possible late-game sweep.
- Use Light Screen or Reflect immediately after Trick Room to provide your team with a lot of bulk.
- Cresselia is great for switching into due to her ability to take multiple hits thanks to her amazing bulk.
- Use Cresselia as a support in dealing a little bit of damage along with your partner, or use Helping Hand to give your partner an offensive boost.

Team Options
========
- Again Cresselia is great for Trick Room teams as it is almost guaranteed you can set up Trick Room with it's impressive bulk.
- Partner Cresselia with slow sweepers such as Mega-Mawile, Rhyperior, and Mega-Ampharos.
- Pair Cresselia with a Fake Out user such as Scrafty or Hitmontop to flinch potential threats to increase chances of getting Trick Room up. Fighting-types also handle the common threats Cresselia has to deal with such as Tyranitar and Bisharp.
- Earthquake users such as Rhyperior are a great match with Cresselia, as she carries Levitate.
- Amoonguss can also be viable as Rage Powder is able to redirect Taunt and guarantee a Trick Room setup. It can also put a potential threat to sleep with Spore.
- Lead with either Cresselia + a physical or special sweeper, as leading with two support Pokemon isn't really effective.

Set Details

- Intimidate users paired with Cresselia's Icy Wind can lower both Attack stat and Speed stat, which can be pretty useful in the long run.
- Steel-types wall this Bulky Offensive Set so Mega-Charizard Y, Heatran, and Landorus-T are great partners.

Checks & Counters
########

- Cresselia despises Knock Off and Dark-types can counter Cresselia if it is not carrying Moonblast.
- Bulky Steel-types wall Cress if it does not have Hidden Power Ground, but even some Steel-types wall Cresselia even with HP Ground such as Scizor, Air Balloon Heatran, Aegislash (STAB Shadow Ball), and Escavalier (STAB Megahorn).
- Cresselia absolutely hates bulky Ghost-types such as Cofagrigus and Dusclops, which wall Cresselia with Pain Split + Will-O-Wisp.
- Bisharp can switch into an incoming Icy Wind and gain a +2 Attack Boost (due to Defiant) and proceed to sweep your team.
- Pokemon carrying Substitute can set up on Trick Room Cresselia and Support Cresselia such as SubTran.
- STAB Bug Bite from Scizor with a Technician boost is a huge threat to Cresselia, as you can even get your precious Chesto or Sitrus Berry eaten.
- Without Mental Herb, Taunt absolutely demolishes Cresselia, as its role as a supporter or a Trick Room setter becomes non-existent.
