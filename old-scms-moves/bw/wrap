Traps and damages the target for 4-5 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and traps the target for 4-5 turns, dealing 1/16 of the target's maximum HP at the end of each of those turns and preventing the target from switching. If the user is holding a Grip Claw, it traps the target for 5 turns all the time. If a trapped Pokemon uses Rapid Spin, it will be freed. If the user is holding a Binding Band, the damage dealt at the end of each turn increases to 1/8 of the target's maximum HP. The target can still switch out if it is holding Shed Shell or uses Baton Pass, U-turn, or Volt Switch. This effect is not stackable or reset by using this or another partial-trapping move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The trapping effect is kind of neat, but Wrap lost almost all of its competitive merit after RBY. Try some other support move in its place instead.</p>
