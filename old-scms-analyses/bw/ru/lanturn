[Overview]

<p>Lanturn is probably one of the, if not the, best bulky  Water-types in RU. Its great defensive Water / Electric typing is shared  with only two other Pokemon—Rotom-W and Chinchou—both of whom are  rather good in their respective tiers as well. Ignore the useless  Illuminate ability and you'll find that it has an ability that other  bulky Water-types would kill for: Volt Absorb. Its typing also grants it  several useful resistances, as well as a weakness to only two types,  all of which is backed by an enormous base 125 HP. Though its base 76  Special Defense might seem dismal, Lanturn is a rather reliable special  wall thanks to its gigantic HP stat. Lanturn's relatively wide movepool  gives it much flexibility and allows it to take on many important roles.  As with several Water-types, Lanturn has wide coverage and can take on  many threats while still fulfilling its duty without fail; this makes it  a great fit on many teams, due to its good typing and ability to halt  several threats just by itself. While Lanturn's defenses aren't as  lopsided as Blissey's, its Defense is really miserable and its Special  Defense isn't the best. Still, Lanturn can tank most special hits all  day long. If you find that your team needs a bulky Water-type, you can  confidently throw in Lanturn, as it's almost certain that it can fill  whatever role you need it to.</p>

<p>This is what Lanturn does best: walling special attackers to no  end. It is capable of taking the myriad of special Fire-, Water-, and  Electric-type moves that are common in the tier, and can easily check  Moltres and Typhlosion that lack Hidden Power Grass. Lanturn is a rather  unique wall itself, as it can go on the offensive if need be. In just 3  moves, Lanturn has near-perfect coverage, resisted by only opposing  Lanturn, Lightningrod Seaking, and Shedinja. Scald is the primary move on any bulky Water-type,  as the ability to burn the target makes it easier for Lanturn to wall  physical threats even though it has a Defense stat comparable to  Blissey's. Ice Beam nails Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Rotom-C,  while Thunderbolt can be used instead to fry Flying-types and opposing  Water-types; however, Lanturn has access to the mouthwatering Volt  Switch, making Ice Beam the preferred option to increase coverage,  especially as the extra power from Thunderbolt is often not needed. Volt  Switch capitalizes on Lanturn's ability to force switches due to its  wonderful bulk and typing, and makes a damaging exit after its role is  done. The final moveslot is dedicated to providing team support; Heal  Bell allows Lanturn to function as a cleric, curing the party of  annoying status, while Thunder Wave aids in slowing down foes, which  is especially useful on more offensive teams.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given HP EVs allow Lanturn to reach the minimum HP for a  Leftovers number, while maximum Defense EVs are used to let it tank an  occasional physical hit. The remaining EVs are invested into Special  Defense along with a Calm nature to make special attacks seem like nothing  to Lanturn. Leftovers is the compulsory item here, providing Lanturn with a pinch of healing. With access to Volt Switch, a partner with  U-turn is naturally a good option. Scyther is a good teammate for Lanturn, and can take most physical shots like a champ, or just heal itself with Roost. Furthermore, it is immune to Ground-type attacks, easily coming on Earthquake and the like; Lanturn can, in turn, come in on Ice- and Water-type attacks without a hitch. This good synergy makes the defensive combination much harder to break through. Ferroseed makes an amazing defensive partner with that in mind; it completes the almost impenetrable fortress by forming a combination of  three Pokemon that covers each others' weaknesses. It has a 4x resistance to the Grass-type attacks that Lanturn abhors, while its  Fire- and Fighting-type weaknesses are dealt with by Lanturn and Scyther, respectively. In addition, Ferroseed can make the their VoltTurn combo even more formidable by providing entry hazards support. Entry hazards such as Spikes just stacks up residual damage on the opponents as they  try to stop the irritating VoltTurn tactic. Leech Seed from Ferroseed also gives Lanturn a way to regain health.</p>

<p>Lanturn has several other moves that can be used to further  support the team. Discharge can be used over Thunderbolt for the  paralysis chance; however, Scald's burn and Discharge's paralysis can  contradict each other, or give the target the less desired status. For  example, Scald would be useful against Bulk Up Gallade as a burn would  cripple it many times over, while Discharge might just give it a 'status  immunity' as paralysis does not affect it as much. Toxic is an  interesting option over Thunder Wave or Heal Bell, as it can cripple  opposing Lanturn especially since it has no other way of dealing  significant damage to it. Lanturn absolutely abhors Toxic Spikes, even  though it has access to Heal Bell, but that has only a miserably low 8  PP. Therefore, a grounded Poison-type or a Rapid Spin user is a great  teammate as it can remove the said entry hazards. Roselia is a good  example of the former and can act as an additional cleric or special  wall to reduce strain on Lanturn.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Lanturn is often viewed as one of RU's premier bulky Water-types, its lack of recovery holds it back. Without any form of recovery, Lanturn becomes somewhat easy to wear down, and so cannot consistently check or counter the Pokemon that it is supposed to deal with. For example, Moltres, a Pokemon who Lanturn is supposed to check, can easily hit the standard Lanturn set with Hidden Power Grass once, switch out, then come back in later to 2HKO it with Hidden Power Grass. To make Lanturn a more consistent check to these types of Pokemon, it can use the RestTalk combination, giving it a form of recovery while ensuring that Lanturn is not completely useless while it is asleep. While BW's sleep mechanics have made this strategy less reliable, Lanturn has a few things which make it stand out, including its excellent bulk, Volt Absorb, good STABs, and Heal Bell.</p>

<p>Rest and Sleep Talk give Lanturn the recovery needed for it to take on the common threats it is meant to take on consistently. Thunderbolt is a powerful STAB attack that Lanturn has at its disposal, and, in tandem with Scald, makes it hard for anything other than Grass-types to switch into Lanturn. However, one thing that you may wish to use is Heal Bell over either of those STAB moves. With Heal Bell, Lanturn can act as a reliable cleric; moreover, Heal Bell helps make the RestTalk combination more reliable, since it will cure Lanturn of its sleep status once selected by Sleep Talk, which means that Lanturn does not always have to wait out those two turns. It also allows you to have a cleric who can use Heal Bell more than eight times. If you decide to do this, though, note that you will be only able to use one of Lanturn's STAB moves, and each move has specific advantages and disadvantages. Thunderbolt will allow Lanturn to hit pesky Flying- and Water-types such as Moltres, Slowking, and Feraligatr hard, but it leaves Lanturn utterly walled by Ground-types and Pokemon with Lightningrod, including Manectric. Scald, on the other hand, will hit Fire-types such as Moltres and Entei and also has a nice chance to burn opponents. However, this makes Lanturn set-up bait for Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Slowking. Either attack will make Lanturn set-up bait for certain Pokemon, so it comes down to team support to ensure that whatever Lanturn is helpless against isn't problematic for your team as a whole.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This EV spread gives Lanturn some nice mixed bulk with a bias towards Special Defense. 40 HP EVs allow Lanturn to hit a Leftovers number, while 252 Defense EVs allow Lanturn to take a fair amount of physical attacks. 216 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature give Lanturn quite a bit of special bulk, and allows it to stomach special attacks from powerful foes such as Moltres with relative ease. The moveset can also be customized to fit certain teams better. If paralysis support is desired, Discharge is an option over Thunderbolt for a higher paralysis rate in exchange for a bit of power. However, Discharge should only be used with Heal Bell or Surf, so that you don't accidentally paralyze a Pokemon who you would want to burn with Scald. If Grass-types are problematic, Ice Beam can be used over Scald; it also forms the illustrious BoltBeam coverage with Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>RestTalk Lanturn tends to work better on dedicated stall or more defensive balanced teams, since these teams often need a reliable check to Moltres, and Lanturn can do this and also provide cleric support. Grass-types such as Ferroseed, Roselia, and Tangrowth work well with Lanturn, since they can take on the Grass- and Ground-type Pokemon who give Lanturn trouble, while Lanturn can beat troublesome Pokemon such as Moltres for them and cure them of troublesome status effects. Roselia and Ferroseed can also set up entry hazards for the defensive team they should be used on. Aerodactyl is another good teammate, as it flawlessly takes on both Ground-types and can set up Stealth Rock for your team. Ironically, Moltres itself makes a wonderful partner for Lanturn, as it uses the Grass-types that Lanturn lures in as set-up bait and can easily dispose of them with its powerful STAB attacks. Furthermore, with Heal Bell support from Lanturn and their access to instant recovery moves, both Aerodactyl and Moltres become incredibly hard to take down when paired alongside Lanturn.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lanturn has a terribly low base 76 Special Attack that might  not even seem usable in the first place; in fact, it doesn't even seem  to give Lanturn much to work with. However, it is actually a rather good  candidate to use Choice Specs, as it has resistances to several common  types which it can come in on and launch powerful Choice Specs-boosted  attacks. Lanturn proves itself to be quite a unique Choice Specs user;  it has excellent natural bulk and a way to heal itself via Volt Absorb.  That, combined with its good set of resistances, makes Lanturn a  fantastic pivot for most balanced teams. Despite its pathetic Special  Attack that doesn't even get past 300, it is deceptively strong and  reaches 406 with a Choice Specs. Though it might not seem like much for a  Choice Specs user, one must keep in mind that Lanturn does not simply  try to severely dent the opponents for a short period of time and then  quickly faint; instead, it aims to deal a chunk of damage for many turns  thanks to its great longevity.</p>

<p>Volt Switch is the main STAB move to use; thanks to its ability  to force switches, Lanturn can make full use of Volt Switch to deal  devastating damage and gain momentum. Lanturn is a fantastic Volt Switch  user too, as its Water typing deters Ground-types from eagerly  switching in to block Volt Switch. Hydro Pump is the strongest move in  its huge arsenal, blasting through anything that does not resist it  while keeping Ground-types at bay. Surf is a more reliable option over  Hydro Pump, though Lanturn finds itself needing all the power it can  get; moreover, a miss might not be as significant for it as it's not  entirely frail and can afford to launch a second attempt. Hidden Power  Fire gives Lanturn a way to burn through Ferroseed, which resists both  its STAB moves. However, Ice Beam can be used to provide superior  coverage and forms the famous BoltBeam combination. If not using Hidden  Power Fire, Hidden Power Grass is useful in handling Quagsire, which can  stop Volt Switch without fear of a super effective Hydro Pump.  Otherwise, Thunderbolt is a more powerful Electric-type STAB move to fry  opposing Water-types and other Pokemon weak to it where should it be  better for Lanturn to stay in.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Special Attack EVs are maximized along with a Modest nature to  push Lanturn's Special Attack to the limit. 120 Speed EVs are required  to outpace minimum Speed Qwilfish, allowing Lanturn to destroy the former  with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch before it can set up too many Spikes. The remaining  EVs are placed into HP to provide Lanturn with additional overall bulk.  Entry hazard support is extremely useful due to Lanturn's tendency to  force switches and gain momentum, which might result in even more  switches. Thus, it can easily rack up plenty of residual damage on the  opposition. Ironically, no matter how annoying Ferroseed is to Lanturn,  it is actually a good teammate to provide this support. Spikes is a pure  annoyance with Lanturn Volt Switching around, and Leech Seed provides a  way for Lanturn to regain HP. Ferroseed also provides a good 4x resistance to  Grass. As much as Lanturn appreciates entry hazards, it also detests  them a lot. As Lanturn itself switches plenty of times, it can be a  victim of the entry hazards as well; thus, a Rapid Spin user such as  Sandslash is therefore a great teammate, as it can not only spin away said  entry hazards but also lay its own Stealth Rock. Natu is something to  consider as its Magic Bounce deters the opponent from recklessly setting  up entry hazards and often attracts Electric-type attacks for Lanturn  to switch in on and gain health for free.</p>

<p>If keeping entry hazards off the field isn't an issue, Scyther  is yet another good teammate to pair with Lanturn. It also has a 4x  resistance to Grass-type moves and an immunity to Ground-type attacks,  and can still attract Ice- and Electric-type attacks for Lanturn to  capitalize on. The pair can then form a solid VoltTurn combination.  Along a safer route, Sawsbuck is a teammate for consideration as it is  immune to Grass and resists Ground-type attacks; it can even nab an  Attack boost by switching into a Grass-type attack.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lanturn is an excellent fit on rain teams, as it can summon  rain with Rain Dance and fend off stray Electric-type attacks  with Volt Absorb. Lanturn often finds it easy to set up Rain Dance on  Fire-, Water-, and Electric-types, and its naturally good special bulk  and typing grant it the ability to reliably bring in the rain and set it  up repeatedly if need be. Setting up rain is a breeze for Lanturn, and  its list of assets does not just end there. Its extensive movepool  allows it to directly abuse the rain and further support the team,  making Lanturn rather invaluable to rain teams. Thunder is a powerful  STAB move to abuse under the storm, frying opposing bulky Water-types  that try to wall your rain sweepers. Hydro Pump is Lanturn's strongest  move that it can randomly fire off in the rain. Surf is another  alternative that also receives a pseudo-STAB from rain but has lower  Base Power in exchange for better accuracy. The last moveslot is a  matter of utility. Volt Switch allows Lanturn to act as a fantastic  pivot that also provides rain support, enabling it to switch in a rain  sweeper unscathed, while Heal Bell grants the team cleric support,  cleansing the team of annoying status. Ice Beam is an option to freeze  Grass-types and Altaria; the former group can deter Lanturn from  switching into a Water-type sweeper, while the latter can launch  powerful Earthquakes and Draco Meteors and nullify the effects of rain if it's running Cloud Nine.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread aims to provide Lanturn with maximum  Special Attack without compromising its bulk too much. The Special  Defense and HP EVs grant it excellent special bulk. Though investing  heavily in its offenses might seem like a bad choice as it has an almost  non-existent base Special Attack, Lanturn can still deal good amount of  damage to most targets. Hydro Pump, in particular, drowns anything that  doesn't resist it, or at least severely dents them. Damp Rock is the  preferred item, prolonging the rain, giving its teammates the maximum  period of time to use it.</p>

<p>Water-type rain sweepers are great teammates for Lanturn. The  latter can switch in freely on Electric-type attacks and replenish its  HP with Volt Absorb, which is even more important with the lack of  Leftovers. While they share a Grass-type weakness, that can often be  handled by another teammate such as Roselia or Ferroseed. In addition,  Ludicolo resists the Ground-type attacks Lanturn is weak to, meaning  that Ludicolo can be manually switched in instead of via Volt Switch to  sponge a Ground-type attack.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Other than by walling opponents with its huge bulk, Lanturn has  other means with which to seriously annoy its foes. The infamous  parafusion set makes a return from DPP Lanturn. While rarely seen, this  set is purely annoying to face, and not a complete gimmick anyway. The  first slot is dedicated to paralyze all opponents bar Ground-types and  other Pokemon immune to Electric-type moves. What allows Lanturn to spam  Thunder Waves randomly is that it deters Ground-types from switching  in, thanks to its Water typing. While Ground-types put their tails  between their legs and flee in fear of getting drowned by a Water-type  STAB, Lanturn happily discharges random bolts of Thunder Wave,  paralyzing things left, right, and center. After that, it can simply  confound the paralyzed opponents with Confuse Ray; the foe has only a  mere 3/8 chance of moving after being crippled by the full brunt of  parafusion. They can then watch in despair as their Pokemon fails to  make a move while Lanturn slowly depletes them of their health, and recover some by munching greedily on its Leftovers.</p>

<p>BW gave Lanturn a huge boon in Volt Switch, making the  parafusion set much easier to pull off. After paralyzing something, such  as Roselia, that Lanturn can't touch, it can make a swift getaway via  Volt Switch, making a safe exit possible as its opponents become slower.  Discharge is an alternative is you want to deal some damage while also  having the possibility of paralyzing something without relying on  Thunder Wave, though the latter is more reliable and Volt Switch is  often too useful to pass up. Ice Beam and Surf vie for the final  moveslot; Ice Beam picks off Grass-types such as Tangrowth and  Ground-types such as Sandslash, while Surf is a reliable STAB move to keep  Ground-types such as Rhydon at bay to prevent them from ruining  Lanturn's parafusion streak.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread grants Lanturn a Leftovers number and also  retains its overall bulk, in order to make it even harder to take down  as the opponents struggle to break free from the parafusion. Leftovers  gives Lanturn greater longevity, while capitalizing on the fact that the  opponent is likely to fail its attack against Lanturn. By paralyzing  and confusing foes, Lanturn forces a ton of switches as the opponent  tries to avoid getting both paralyzed and confused in an attempt to  evade complete parafusion. This makes entry hazard support particularly  useful to indirectly drain the foes of their HP, without Lanturn having  to throw assaults at them. Ferroseed is a great teammate for this role;  it can lay Spikes or Stealth Rock to aid Lanturn in gradually weakening  the opponents, while also providing nice synergy with its  teammate—Lanturn can easily switch in on Fire-type attacks that will  roast Ferroseed while also being able to switch out to it when faced  with a Grass-type. However, one must take note to never employ Toxic  Spikes with parafusion Lanturn around as that spoils the chances of it  being able to paralyze targets.</p>

<p>Teammates that appreciate the paralysis support which Lanturn  easily provides are great as well. Moltres and Bouffalant have rather  good synergy with Lanturn, and can make good use of the paralysis to  sweep entire teams; the latter even has Sap Sipper to make itself a  fearsome sweeper. Other notable slow but powerful teammates include  Torterra, Gallade, and Druddigon. The paralysis support Lanturn gives  the team aids them to sweep late-game, meaning that parafusion Lanturn  isn't merely a gimmick, but also an alternative way to provide great and  annoying team support. However, if you'd like to be a really  frustrating opponent to face, a teammate that can utilize paraflinch can  work on top of Lanturn's parafusion. Rotom-S is an example that can  spam Air Slash right after Lanturn's parafusion to cut down the  opponent's chance of moving to approximately 1/4. Still, it is highly  unlikely for anyone not to switch and take the full brunt of parafusion  and paraflinch, unless it's the last Pokemon left.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Lanturn's wide movepool stretches down as deep as the oceans  that it lives in. It contains a wide array of interesting moves, such as  Aqua Ring, Electro Ball, Mist, Psybeam, Screech, Signal Beam, and  Stockpile. However, most of them are not as useful as the moves stated  in the given sets. Signal Beam shouldn't be used anyway as Lanturn  already has access to Ice Beam, which is better in every aspect you can  think of aside from hitting Exeggutor minutely stronger. Stockpile is a possibility to make Lanturn surprisingly hard  to take down. Agility makes Lanturn as fast as a dolphin and gives  it a shot at sweeping, though its Special Attack is rather poor and hard  to work with. Lanturn can make use of the SubCharge set to attempt a  sweep thanks to its good bulk, typing, and coverage. However, in a tier  full of phazers and bulky Pokemon, Lanturn has a tough time breaking  through many of them. The SubCharge set has a good ability of breaking  through teams reliant on the rare Fire / Water / Grass cores,  though.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Lanturn's Water / Electric typing grants it many resistances  and only two weaknesses. However, there are still a few flaws to work  around Lanturn. Grass- and Ground-types aren't rare in the RU tier, and  might even be common enough to keep Lanturn on its toes or fins.  Grass-types are terribly troublesome for Lanturn, even though it might  carry the occasional Ice Beam to ward them off. Still, Grass-types with  great special bulk, such as Roselia, will not be deterred and can easily  defeat Lanturn; Ferroseed and Lilligant can even set up on it. Anything  with a physical Ground-type attack can scare it off as well; moreover,  strong physical attackers such as Aerodactyl, Gallade, and Aggron can  demolish Lanturn before it can retaliate. The rare Water Absorb Quagsire  walls it to no end, unless it carries Hidden Power Grass. While Lanturn  can wall most special attackers easily, it will easily fold after a  physical hit or two. Ironically, opposing Lanturn also completely walls  itself, unless it carries Toxic. Then again, it can cure itself with  Heal Bell. Lanturn vs. Lanturn matchups also allows both parties to let  their Lanturn do their respective roles, from setting up the rain to  curing the team of status, without any trouble. In the event that the  final Pokemon on each team happens to be Lanturn, have fun trying to PP  stall each other out.</p>
