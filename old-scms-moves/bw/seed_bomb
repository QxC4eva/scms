<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Seed Bomb, as a relatively high powered Grass-type physical attack, allows physical attacking Grass-types like Breloom and Cacturne to have a hard-hitting STAB move. However, the most common use of Seed Bomb is on Belly Drum Linoone, where it is used to hit the Rock- and Ground-types that stand in the way of its STAB ExtremeSpeed, as well as Quagsire who otherwise nullifies Linoone's Belly Drum Attack boost.</p>
