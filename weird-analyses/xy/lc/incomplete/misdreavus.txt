Overview
########

Misdreavus is one of the most versatile Pokemon in Little Cup. It may seem that the Knock Off buff and Hidden Power nerf hurt this queen of Little Cup, but a few factors contribute to it still being one of the best Pokemon in Little Cup. The Ghost STAB boost increased the viability of offensive sets, and also lessened Misdreavus' reliability on Hidden Power Fighting. Also, it deals solidly with some of the top threats in the metagame thanks to its bulk and movepool.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot Attacker
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Thunderbolt / Dazzling Gleam
move 4: Will-o-Wisp / Substitute
ability: Levitate
item: Eviolite / Life Orb
evs: 236 Atk / 36 SpD / 236 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Nasty Plot is the obvious boosting move, allows Misdreavus' already high Special Attack to skyrocket.
Shadow Ball is the obvious STAB move, OHKOs an incredible amount of Pokemon at +2 and is blessed with the arguably best offensive type in Little Cup
Thunderbolt complements Shadow Ball by dealing super effective damage to common Misdreavus answers, such as Vullaby.
Dazzling Gleam is the new released move for Misdreavus, and notably OHKOs Scraggy, once the bane of Misdreavus, while still hitting Vullaby super effectively and Pawniard neutrally.
Will-o-Wisp is very notable in the current metagame, due to it burning the omnipresent physical attackers of Little Cup and essentially taking them out of the game.
Substitute is also a worthy move, allowing Missy set-up on status spreading Pokemon and avoiding Pawniard's Sucker Punch
Set Details
========
EVs are standard max/max with the extra point thrown in Special Defense
Eviolite grants Misdreavus even greater bulk, giving it excellent bulk to set up with.
Life Orb is for power, most notably guaranteeing an OHKO on Eviolite Gligar with Shadow Ball.
You can also use Icy Wind to pick off Gligar with Eviolite, but does not get enough general coverage to necessarily warrant a slot.
Usage Tips
========
Simply bring in Misdreavus on any Pokemon unable to touch it, then notch a Nasty Plot in order to begin smashing in the opponent.
Early game, you can simply spam Will-o-Wisp in order to cripple the opponent, then set up Nasty Plot later.
With Eviolite, Misdreavus does best mid to late game cleaning.
With Life Orb, Misdreavus is best used as an early to mid game wallbreaker.
Team Options
========
Fighting types partner this set well, as Misdreavus despises bulky Normal Pokemon like Porygon and Munchlax, who as such fear Fighting types.
Scarf Pokemon and Speed Boosters partner this well offensively as well, as they can clean after Misdreavus rips holes through the opponent's team.
Bulky Support
########
name: Bulky Support
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Will-o-Wisp
move 3: Taunt / Substitute
move 4: Icy Wind / Dazzling Gleam
ability: Levitate
item: Berry Juice
evs: 36 HP / 236 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Shadow Ball is the main STAB, standard fare with a consistent damage output.
Will-o-Wisp is very important on this set, oriented towards distributing burns. Burn is extremely notable in the current metagame, making this a necessity.
Taunt has always been one of the best moves when used correctly. Misdreavus can outspeed and Taunt every single Smasher in LC. It can also defeat defensive Pokemon and hazard Pokemon through this.
Substitute can be used instead in order to avoid Sucker Punch and Knock Off from Pokemon such as Pawniard.
Icy Wind defeats a huge threat in the current metagame, Gligar, with ease, and its side effect discourages switching in.
Dazzling Gleam, Misdreavus' new move, has better neutral coverage with Ghost and notably OHKOs Scraggy.
Set Details
========
EVs are standard due to the fact that Misdreavus has solid enough natural bulk, and the 19 speed tier is very valuable.
Berry Juice is the item of choice due to the fact Misdreavus has no reliable recovery, making the full HP restoring very valuable.
Thunderbolt is an option in the last slot to hit Waters hard, but they are often not relevant enough to warrant its use.
Usage Tips
========
Misdreavus should generally just burn switch ins early game and try to cripple the entire team to simplify the life of another Pokemon.
This set functions well as a lead due to both Taunt and Will-o-Wisp, as well as it having a generally good matchup with most Pokemon.
Team Options
========
This Misdreavus is an excellent partner to many Dark types, most notably Pawniard, as Will-o-Wisp allows Pawniard to set up much better.
It also functions as a solid enough Meditite counter for teams that need it, while being glue generally.
