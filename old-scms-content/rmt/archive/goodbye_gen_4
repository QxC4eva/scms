<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As everyone knows, Pokemon Black and White came out like 2 weeks ago. This means I will probably never play generation 4 again unless it's for tournaments(like SPL). With all the new Pokemon and items, I doubt that hail is going to work, you never know though!</p>

<p>Anyway, with the Black and White release, with this team being my best one, and with a lot of people knowing this team now, so why not make a RMT?</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/465.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Abomasnow</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Snow Warning<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 224 SpD / 32 Spe<br />
Sassy Nature<br />
- Wood Hammer<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Protect<br />
- Leech Seed</p>

<p>You will see an Abomasnow in any hail team of course. I'm leading with it because I want to start hail ASAP, 6% damage every turn to the opposite Pokemon is really good, especially that Ice types aren't really common in OU. 32 Speed EVs are there to outspeed Swampert leads and OHKO them with Wood Hammer before they set up rocks, even though Swampert leads are very rare these days I'll keep the 32 Speed EVs, adding them to SDef isn't really going to help me anyway.</p>

<p>Without Abomasnow this team will have a really hard time against stuff like CroCune, and the 1-x comebacks with Curse Snorlax or Curse Tyranitar. With Leech Seed Abomasnow is almost always at full health, Leech Seed also helps me to against the popular Abomasnow switch-ins like Scizor, Leech Seed + Protect + SR and Spikes make stuff like it to die before they do any damage to the team.</p>

<p><strong>Skarmory</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Keen Eye<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 24 Def / 196 SpD / 36 Spe<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Whirlwind<br />
- Brave Bird<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Roost</p>

<p>As I said before, I only made this team because my old team needed a Steel type, so I chose Skarmory. It's not there only because it's a Steel type, it is also one of the best Spikes user and Scizor switch-ins.</p>

<p>This spread is used to make it bulky in both, defence and special defence. The 36 Speed EVs are there to let it outspeed CB Tyranitar and other Skarmory's.</p>

<p>Spikes is really helpful for this team, it lets me kill stuff like Roar Heatran and Swords Dance Scizor, who can do some damage to this team, easier. </p>

<p>That's it really. Skarmory might not do many stuff, but it is really helpful for this team.</p>

<p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Poison Point<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Toxic Spikes<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Earthquake</p>

<p>Nidoqueen, like any other member of this team, is really important. Without it, I lose to things like SD Roost Scizor. </p>

<p>Stealth Rock to hurt anything that switches in(duh). Toxic Spikes helps me against stuff that I can't toxic with Blissey because they will weaken/kill it if I do, like Tyranitar, who is really a problem for this team team, especially DD and the mixed versions, who get screwed by Toxic Spikes. Fire Blast is obviously for Scizor and Forretress, who can set up on this team. </p>

<p>This my counter to Lucario, and if Nidoqueen dies before Lucario it means I have to burn it with Spiritomb, which isn't really the best way to deal with Lucario. Nidoqueen is also my Trick switch-in, she doesn't really mind being choiced.</p>

<p><strong>Blissey</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 148 HP / 252 Def / 108 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Wish<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Protect<br />
- Seismic Toss</p>

<p>Wish support, walling most of the special attackers, and Toxic. That is pretty much what Blissey does to this team. </p>

<p>With Wish I can heal Abomasnow and Nidoqueen, Abomasnow doesn't really lose a lot of its health most of the time, but Nidoqueen is mostly at low health. Without Blissey, Zapdos can dominate this team. If I see a Zapdos I never take risks with Blissey that cause killing her, otherwise I have to burn it and stall it out with Spiritomb, who usually dies to other stuff. Toxic helps against anything that isn't a Steel or Poison type, obviously, with hail damage and poison it makes stuff die faster.</p>

<p><strong>Spiritomb</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 30 Def / 228 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk </p>

<p>Spiritomb is one of my favorite Pokemon, but that isn't really the reason I'm using it for. I'm using it mainly because it's a ghost/ who can block Rapid Spin, and because of Gengar, who I couldn't touch at all with the previous team.</p>

<p>Starmie is already a good spinner, but with this thing Pursuiting ghosts like Rotom-A, it will be an even better spinner. Though, I rarely Pursuit Rotom-A's with this, but at some points it is really needed. Pursuit is also for the biggest threat to my old version of the team, Gengar, I literally didn't have anything for Gengar with the previous version. Will-o-wisp is to cripple things like Scizor, who sometimes switch in on Spiritomb for some reason, it also helps me against DD Tyranitar with Lum Berry(after Toxic Spikes activate it). Rest and Sleep Talk are there to heal it and remove status. </p>

<p><strong>Starmie</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs:  252 HP / 120 Def / 136 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Surf<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>My team needs a spinner, so I decided to use Starmie for multiple reasons, not to spin only. It also counters Gyarados, who can be a problem to this team without Starmie.</p>

<p>I'm using Bold nature with max HP and a lot of Defence to take Physical attacks better. With this spread, Scarf Tyranitar can never OHKO me with Crunch/Pursuit on the switch, which has helped me in a lot of battles. Without Starmie, as I mentioned before, Gyarados can be a big problem to this team. I have to watch out for CB Gyarados who can Payback me on the switch though, but thankfully, it's rare. With Pursuit Spiritomb, Starmie spins much easier.</p>
