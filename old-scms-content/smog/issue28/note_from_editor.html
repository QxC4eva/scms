    <p>As a result of the recent DDoS attack on the Smogon.com site, this issue of the Smog comes in a little later than expected. The time the site was down caused the Smog team some production bottlenecks that forced us to push the release date to this weekend. Rather unfortunate, I know. Nonetheless, issue #28 is right here, and it is packed with an excellent variety of articles specifically put together for our community and audience!</p>

    <p>For those of you who enjoy the Battling Strategy and Metagame sections, you will be glad to know that this edition of the Smog brings forward several Spotlight articles featuring Landorus in OverUsed, Druddigon in RarelyUsed, Scolipede and Kangaskhan in NeverUsed, as well as Heatran in Doubles. But you will also find&mdash;among others&mdash;metagame analyses, underrated movesets, and a very cool introduction to competitive GSC. The Entertainment category is also loaded with a range of amusing articles that will for sure get a laugh or two out of you, and I will just name one of them: Smogon Conspiracy Theories: What Really Goes on Behind the Scenes... Go figure! Last but not least, Judge a Pok&eacute;mon makes a reappearence with its 11th installment in which Mewtwo, Helioptile, and Sylveon are some of the featured suspects. Go check 'em out!</p>

    <p>We hope you enjoy issue #28, and as always, here is a <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=79">link</a> to the project's sub-forum where we open up a User Feedback poll shortly after every release; you're welcome to take a look at it any time!
