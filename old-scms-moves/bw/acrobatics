<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Acrobatics is a funny old move, and is seemingly lauded or condemned depending on the day of the week. On one day it's a monstrous weapon in the hands of Flying Gem Gliscor, and on another day it's completely useless, and most other Flying-types would rather keep their held items, thanks very much, and use a more powerful STAB move instead. Even so, while Acrobatics is certainly not the most powerful of moves competitively, it does have a few applications in certain situations. The aforementioned Flying Gem Gliscor can abuse Sand Veil, Substitute, and Swords Dance to boost its Attack and unleash a monstrous boosted Acrobatics for one turn, while maintaining a very powerful STAB 110 Base Power Flying-type attack after losing its item. Another notable user is Flying Gem Archeops. Since Flying Gem is used up before the move takes place, Acrobatics gets the boost from the Flying Gem and the boost from Archeops not holding an item, effectively tripling the power of the move, which when coupled with Archeops's monstrous base 140 Attack stat makes for an attack with the potential to do massive damage to just about anything.</p>
