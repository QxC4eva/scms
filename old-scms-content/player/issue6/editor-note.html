		<p>This is the second issue this month, but the first issue without Scene as an editor. It's been a fantastic experience working with him as a co-leader and we all wish him well as he moves through university. It's a massive shame to see him go, but I hope you enjoy this issue just as much! Issue 6 is packed with goodness, such as the next installment of Ask the Admins, the Perilous Pundit answering some of your questions, and a cracking interview with Spydreigon. I'm sure you'll enjoy reading this as much as I have.</p>
		
		<p>This year has been great and I hope you've had a great break over the past few days. Next year should be even bigger and better!</p>
		
		<p>Happy New Year!</p>
