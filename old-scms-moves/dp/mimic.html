[LONG DESC]
<p>Copies the last move used by the target. Mimic fails if the target has not used a move since it's been out; or if it has attempted to use a move but failed (due to sleep, freeze, etc.); or if the target's last move was Metronome, Struggle, Sketch, Mimic, Chatter; or if the user already knows the target's last move. The Mimicked move has 5 PP.
