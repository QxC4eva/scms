<p>No PP is spent for the move used. If Sleep Talk selects Blast Burn, Frenzy Plant, Giga Impact, Hydro Cannon, Hyper Beam, Roar of Time, or Rock Wrecker, Sleep Talk loses 1 PP when using the move, and if the user remains asleep next turn, Sleep Talk is forced to be selected for the recharge turn and loses another PP.

<p>If Sleep Talk selects Ice Ball or Rollout in consecutive turns, they are not boosted. If Sleep Talk selects Outrage, Petal Dance, or Thrash, the user is not locked into the attack and will not become confused.</p>
