Uses foe's Berry.

[LONG DESC]
<p>If the target is holding any kind of Berry, the user takes it and uses it immediately. If the target is holding a Jaboca or Rowap Berry, the Berry has no effect, but is still removed. If the target is holding a Coba Berry, it activates and reduces the damage of Pluck before it can be stolen. If an Embargoed Pokemon uses Pluck on a Pokemon holding a Berry, the Berry is destroyed without being activated.</p>
