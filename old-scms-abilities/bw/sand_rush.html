Speed doubles in sandstorm. 

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If sandstorm is the prevailing weather condition, the wielder's Speed stat is doubled. If the sandstorm ends or a new weather condition is brought into play, the wielder's Speed returns to normal. In addition, if a non-Ground-, Rock-, or Steel-type Pokemon has this ability, it will not take damage from sandstorm.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This ability is part of what makes <a href="/bw/pokemon/excadrill">Excadrill</a> the huge threat it is. Incredible Attack isn't dangerous if Excadrill can't get a hit in, but with decent Speed already which is then doubled by Sand Rush, Excadrill exceeds even <a href="/bw/pokemon/kingdra">Kingdra</a> in weather domination. Follow this up with <a href="/bw/moves/swords_dance">Swords Dance</a> and great coverage, and Excadrill becomes an unparalleled weather threatâ€”indeed, this was the factor that got Excadrill eventually banned from OU. <a href="/bw/pokemon/sandslash">Sandslash</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/stoutland">Stoutland</a> are the only other notable wielders of this ability in standard play, but they don't even come close to what Excadrill was or is capable of.</p>
