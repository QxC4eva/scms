Overview
########

- Great physical bulk
- Great typing providing important resistances to Fairy, Fighting and Grass
- Amazing ability in Levitate giving Koffing a Ground immunity (which would be a weakness without it)
- One of the few viable Toxic Spikers in the tier
- Exploitable special defense
- Lacks offensive presence
- Levitate prevents it from absorbing Toxic Spikes

Moves
========

-Will-O-Wisp is a must to cripple physical attackers
-Sludge Bomb is to have some offensive presence and the 30% poison chance is nice
-Toxic Spikes are very useful to wear down opposing bulky pokemon like Porygon you may otherwise struggle with.
-Fire Blast is to have a way past steels like Ferroseed who may otherwise wall you completely.
-Clear Smog is obviously there to make sure things like Tirtouga, Dwebble or Spritzee don't set up on you.

Set Details
========

-EVs: aiming for hp and defense, dumping the rest in special defense
-Berry Juice is there because Koffing is rarely OHKO'd if you stay away from SE or strong special moves and it lacks recovery

Usage Tips
========


-Nice bulky pivot
-It's not always needed to set up 2 layers of Toxic Spikes, but if you have get a free turn and you have nothing better to do, go for it
-Koffing can easily come in on Fighting types excluding Meditite and burn them or set up Tspikes
-One of the better switch ins to the dangerous Fairy types


Team Options
========

-Chinchou takes care of the fire types Koffing struggles with and they make a nice tanky core and cover eachothers weaknesses quite well.
-Timburr forces switches which helps spread Toxic from the spikes and smashes everything with Knock Off, sadly it stacks a Psychic weakness.
-Ferroseed covers Psychic types while Koffing covers Fighting types. Sadly the both struggle with Fire types.
-Bulky Normal types (Munchlax, Porygon, Lickitung) like having Fighting types removed and they can handle Psychic types. Lickitung is extra nice as a teammate since it can Wishpass.
-Dark types (Murkrow, Houndour, Pawniard, Scraggy) handle Psychic types while Koffing handles bulky Fairy types for them.


Other Options
########
-Pain Split it has 4 moveslot syndrome and needs all of it's moves. If you do choose to use Pain Split Eviolite is the preferred item.
-Rest/Sleep Talk is usable and a great sun counter but takes away from Koffing's overall utility. Eviolite is preferred if you do use it.
-Toxic
-Thunderbolt to hit some waters or flyings
-Destiny Bond but it's a bit slow too use it
-Memento if you want it to support a set up sweeper
-Infestation if you are into that stuff
-Taunt for slower walls
-Shadow Ball for hitting Psychic switch ins
-Explosion

Checks & Counters
########

-Basically any strong special attacker
-Fire types like Ponyta are unaffected by Will-o-wisp and can just hammer away at it until it dies
-Rapid Spinners spin away your Toxic Spikes
-Defoggers blow away your Toxic Spikes and the best Pokémon with access to the move are immune to Toxic Spikes
-Grounded poison types absorb your Toxic Spikes, mainly Tentacool which can set up it's own Toxic Spikes and Koffing can't absorb them.
-Koffing basically hates any attacker with Substitute as long as they are not weak to poison.
-Natu bounces back Toxic Spikes and Will-O-Wisp (which Koffing can't absorb itself) and hits it with a super effective Psychic.
-Mold Breaker EQ is something Koffing really doesn't want to deal with. Therefore Cranidos and Drilbur handle it pretty well but they have to be wary of Will-O-Wisp.
-Gothita traps Koffing and kills it.
-Chinchou, Munchlax and Lickitung dont care about burn or poison if they are running resttalk and Koffings attacks dont do anything to them.
