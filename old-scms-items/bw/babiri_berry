<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by a Pokemon, reduces the power of a damaging Steel-type move that would hit the holder for super effective damage by 50%. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Steel-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Some would say that Babiri Berry is a poor item choice, as there are few types weak to Steel and even fewer Pokemon willing to use Steel-type moves. However, among those that do is one of the most feared Pokemon in the game—Bullet Punch Scizor, and as such there are several Pokemon that can hold Babiri Berry in order to help you outwit the metal menace. Tyranitar is the prime example, as it can lure Scizor in, use Babiri Berry to survive one Bullet Punch, and then destroy Scizor with Fire Punch or Flamethrower, thus ridding your team of Scizor for that battle. Tyranitar and Terrakion can also use Babiri Berry on their sweeping sets in order to prevent Scizor from ending their sweeps prematurely—Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Swords Dance Terrakion are notable examples of this.</p>
