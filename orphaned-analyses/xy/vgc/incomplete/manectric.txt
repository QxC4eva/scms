Moves
========

-Thunderbolt as Electric STAB move of choice
-Overheat for extremely strong Fire-type move but does lower Special Attack
-Flamethrower for varied move type
-Hidden Power Ice for coverage
-Volt Switch could keep momentum going as well as allow Intimidate to activate again
-Protect to stall a turn and for lack of anything better
-Snarl deals good damage due to Mega Manectrics high Special Attack and can cripple other special sweepers

Set Details
========

-Standard special sweeper EVs
-Mega Manectric so Manectite
-Modest to maximize power as Mega Mane already has a high base Speed

Usage Tips
========

-Mega evolve when there are physical attackers out on the opponents
-No spread moves so be wary of that
-Strong lead due to high Speed stat and Intimidate after mega evolution
-If they do not carry any Electric-type attacks, mega evolve asap as Intimidate being brought on earlier is better

Team Options
========

-Gyarados: Brings Intimidate to cripple physical pokemon even more and covers Ground weakness
-Amoonguss: Isnt scared of what counters Manectric and provides Spore / Rage Powder support
-Ground-types: Allow Discharge spam
-Politoed: Brings Thunder to a 100% accuracy


Other Options
########

-Discharge
-Thunder
-LO Manectric
-Expert Belt Manectric
-HP Grass

Checks & Counters
########

-Rotom-H: Resists all moves and can stall out
-Ground-types: Manectric is pretty frail and can get ohko'd by most Ground-types unless after Intimidate. General rule, if you cant ohko them, they will ohko you.
-Dragon-types: If you do not carry HP Ice, they can be a pain to deal with. Even if you do, Goodra can take hits due to its naturally high Special Defense.
