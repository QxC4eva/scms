Overview
########
Slowbro is an example of a Pokemon that has almost all of the tools it needs to pull off exactly what it needs to. Packed with great HP and Defense stats in combination with reliable recovery and the ever so useful Regenerator, Slowbro makes for a fantastic physical wall and support Pokemon. Slowbro's Water / Psychic typing provides it useful resistances to Fighting-, Fire-, and Water-type attacks, allowing it to check a large variety of physical attackers in the tier. Sadly for Slowbro, its typing also gives it weaknesses to some common attacking types, such as Bug, Electric, and Ghost. Because of this, it is weak to both U-turn and Volt Switch, meaning momentum can easily be lost. Moreover, an exploitable vulnerability to status, an abysmal Speed stat, and middling Special Defense leave quite a bit to be desired when it comes down to choosing Slowbro as a physical wall.

Physical Wall
########
name: Physical Wall
move 1: Scald
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Slack Off
move 4: Thunder Wave / Toxic / Fire Blast
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========
Scald is Slowbro's primary STAB move, potentially crippling the opponent with its 30% burn chance. This helps Slowbro do chip damage to opponents, and more importantly, gives it extra breathing room against physically offensive threats. Ice Beam has great coverage alongside Scald, hitting Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Garchomp, and Salamence for huge damage. Slack Off is a bread-and-butter move for a wall that should be used to keep Slowbro healthy throughout the game. Thunder Wave serves as a way to hinder speedy threats, whereas Toxic allows Slowbro to cripple opposing walls. The latter option is best suited for teams that have enough bulk to stall out the Pokemon that Slowbro poisons. Fire Blast is an alternative to the two status moves that aids Slowbro in dealing with Scizor and Ferrothorn. In terms of other moves, Psychic is a possible option to nail the physical Fighting-types that Slowbro walls.

Set Details
========
As Slowbro is a defensive Pokemon, Leftovers is an ideal item that allows it to heal its HP over time. However, as Slowbro has other existing methods of recovery, Rocky Helmet is also a viable item. A Rocky Helmet allows Slowbro to deal chip damage to wear down physical attackers that make contact with Slowbro. Full investment is placed into Slowbro's HP and Defense EVs in tandem with a Bold nature to maximize its physical bulk in order to fulfill its role as a wall. In terms of abilities, Regenerator is Slowbro's best bet and is a great ability for a wall, providing it with a form passive healing just by switching out. While Oblivious may look appealing to provide Slowbro with an immunity to the effects of Taunt, the passive recovery provided by Regenerator is far too useful in comparison.

Usage Tips
========
Slowbro is best brought into battle as a check to physical attackers or when convenient in order to spread status. This means switching Slowbro in on Pokemon such as Terrakion or Azumarill is typically a good idea. When Slowbro has nothing else to do, spreading status in the form of Thunder Wave or Toxic is a good way of applying pressure on the opponent. Slack Off should be used generously to ensure that Slowbro stays healthy throughout a game, but it is possible that an opponent will set up on Slowbro, so using a status or offensive move is a better option to counteract that. One can also use Regenerator healing by constantly double switching Slowbro or bringing it on in free switches to then immediately jump back out.

Team Options
========
Despite having a decent Special Defense stat, Slowbro appreciates partners that can sponge powerful special attacks for it. Amoonguss is an excellent partner for Slowbro by forming a potent Regenerator core and being able to take Electric-type moves with ease. As an option to work alongside Amoonguss, Heatran can complete a Fire / Water / Grass core and provide a useful resistance to Bug-type moves. Goodra, which possesses a spectacular Special Defense stat, can also switch into Slowbro's Grass- and Electric-type weaknesses and handle one of Slowbro's premier checks: Thundurus-T. Pokemon which can provide Aromatherapy or Heal Bell support are also ideal because they patch up Slowbro's weakness to status. As a result, Sylveon, Chansey, and Blissey are all superb partners to Slowbro that have acceptable defensive synergy.

Offensive Trick Room
########
name: Offensive Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Surf
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Fire Blast / Psyshock
ability: Regenerator
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Quiet

Moves
========
With great bulk, a decent offensive presence, and an awful Speed stat, Slowbro is a prime candidate for a Trick Room user. Trick Room is used to flip the Speed tiers on their head and allow Slowbro and its teammates to move first. This means that it can be used as a standalone set, but works best with Pokemon that appreciate the provided support. Surf is Slowbro's strongest Water-type move and its basic offensive move. Together with Surf, Ice Beam and Fire Blast round off the coverage, leaving Slowbro only unable to break through bulky Water-types. The former is used to hit Grass- and Dragon-type super effectively, while the latter provides a way for Slowbro to roast Genesect, Scizor, and Ferrothorn. However, if hitting these Pokemon with Fire Blast for super effective damage is unnecessary, Psyshock can be placed in the final slot to operate as a secondary STAB move. Psyshock also comes with the benefit of hitting specially defensive walls on their lower defensive stat, as well as hitting Mega Venusaur which can otherwise fully counter it.

Set Details
========
Through the use of a Life Orb, Slowbro's low starting power is enhanced, and it doesn't need to worry about the recoil due to Regenerator healing excess damage that it might have incurred. All EVs are invested into Slowbro's power and bulk, ensuring it can take as many hits as possible while simultaneously dealing as much damage as possible. Finally, because Slowbro is using Trick Room, a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to minimize its Speed under such conditions, allowing Slowbro to move before almost all OU threats when it is under Trick Room.

Usage Tips
========
Offensive Trick Room Slowbro is a Pokemon which can be used at virtually any point of a match, but excels late-game when it can clean up teams that its own team has already broken down. However, thanks to a spectacular ability in Regenerator, Slowbro can act as a pivot by constantly jumping in and out of the fray to set up Trick Room. This means it is best to use Slowbro more conservatively than other Pokemon, only attacking when necessary and after Trick Room has been activated. Furthermore, Slowbro can take advantage of Regenerator's passive healing through double switching so that it can be preserved for later. In the event that opponents attempt to prevent Slowbro from activating Trick Room through the use of Taunt, it is best to attack immediately and exploit Slowbro's surprising power.

Team Options
========
Slow, hard hitters which appreciate Trick Room support always enjoy being paired with Slowbro. In particular, Conkeldurr can take full advantage of Trick Room and gets past Jellicent through the use of Thunder Punch or Knock Off. Magnezone is also a decent partner if Slowbro opts not to run Fire Blast, as it can trap and KO Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Jirachi. Porygon2, a Pokemon that is often seen on Trick Room teams, can also partner nicely with Slowbro due to their complementary resistances and himmunities. Pursuit users such as Tyranitar are good alternative partners for Slowbro by virtue of their ability to handle the likes of Jellicent.

Other Options
########
Aside from the above sets, Slowbro could potentially utilize a Choice Specs set to make use of its unique movepool and bulk. However, with a base Special Attack stat of 100 and an awful Speed stat, Slowbro can only do so much. Alternatively, Slowbro can attempt to run a Calm Mind set, but it needs several boosts to have a chance to sweep, and in that time, the opponent can take the time to cripple Slowbro as it sets up. Such a set is also eclipsed by other bulky boosting sweepers, such as Reuniclus and Jirachi, because of their immunity to Toxic. Slowbro can also opt to use an Assault Vest to balance out its defensive stats, but Slowking can perform this role better due to its access to Dragon Tail.

Checks & Counters
########
- **Powerful Special Attackers**: Because Slowbro primarily focuses on its physical bulk, it is quite vulnerable to common special attacks such as Thunderbolt. Powerful special attackers, such as Thundurus, Rotom-W, Greninja, Celebi, and Genesect, are all capable of taking at least one of Slowbro's attacks and retaliating with their respective super effective moves. Other options for this role include Gengar and Latios, which can both dent Slowbro with their primary STAB moves.

- **Specially Defensive Walls**: Celebi, Chansey, Blissey, and Gastrodon are the best defensive counters to Slowbro. The first three all have a way of getting around Toxic and all of them brush off anything else that Slowbro might try to use against them. Mega Venusaur can take all of offensive Slowbro's moves due to its Thick Fat ability, and can retaliate with its Grass-type STAB. As a result, these Pokemon almost always beat Slowbro one-on-one.

- **Toxic**: Even though Slowbro can heal itself with Slack Off or Regenerator, Toxic or two layers of Toxic Spikes can be used to wear it down over time. Slowbro has no way of curing status without relying on teammates or the otherwise useless Rest. Examples of Pokemon that can do this include Chansey and Blissey, but any Pokemon commonly seen with Toxic can suit this role.

- **Taunt and Trick**: Trick is an excellent way of shutting down most defensive Pokemon, and, as a result, it is a great check to defensive variants of Slowbro. Some potential users of Trick include Jirachi and Latios. Alternatively, Taunt users such as Thundurus and Sableye can also be used to prevent Slowbro from healing with Slack Off, spreading status, or setting up Trick Room.
