<h2>Offensive Threats</h2>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/accelgor.gif" alt="Accelgor" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/accelgor"><strong>Accelgor</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 70 Atk / 40 Def / 100 SpA / 60 SpD / 145 Spe<br />
Abilities: Hydration / Sticky Hold / Unburden</p>

<p>Accelgor is most notable for its unmatched base 145 Speed and access to Spikes, which allow it to become a very good suicide Spiker for offensive teams. Accelgor is no slouch offensively as well, with a decent 100 Special Attack that allows it to damage the opposition hard if needed. It also has some interesting movepool options, such as Final Gambit, which prevents the spinners from spinning away the Spikes temporarily, and Yawn, which can force switches and allow Accelgor to get more layers of Spikes up.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/ambipom.gif" alt="Ambipom" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/ambipom"><strong>Ambipom</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 100 Atk / 66 Def / 60 SpA / 66 SpD / 115 Spe<br />
Abilities: Pickup / Technician / Skill Link</p>

<p>Ambipom is not the biggest offensive powerhouse in the tier, yet it does have some saving graces over its main competition, Cinccino. Having access to a Technician-boosted Fake Out and some moves Cinccino would love, such as Low Kick and Beat Up, makes Ambipom not completely outclassed. Ambipom can still be a sufficient offensive threat against frailer offensive teams, which keeps it from becoming dead weight on a team. Use Ambipom to its advantages, or else it will play out as an inferior Cinccino.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/arcanine.gif" alt="Arcanine" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/arcanine"><strong>Arcanine</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 110 Atk / 80 Def / 100 SpA / 90 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Intimidate / Flash Fire / Justified</p>

<p>Arcanine's decent base 110 Attack and excellent abilities in Intimidate and Flash Fire allow it to distinguish itself from the multitude of other Fire-types in the tier. Access to the vaunted ExtremeSpeed, along with other goodies such as Flare Blitz and Close Combat, makes Arcanine capable of separating it from Darmanitan and Victini, who would outclass Arcanine otherwise. Intimidate gives Arcanine a buffer in defensive capabilities, making it surprisingly sturdy on the physical side when fully invested.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/azelf.gif" alt="Azelf" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/azelf"><strong>Azelf</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 125 Atk / 70 Def / 125 SpA / 70 SpD / 115 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Azelf's terrific offensive stats and great movepool options make it a powerful threat in UU. Azelf is best known for being a lead that can set up Stealth Rock or dual screens early in the game, which can be extremely beneficial for more offensive teams. Azelf also has access to Nasty Plot, which makes it an insanely threatening sweeper if it gains the opportunity to set up.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/azumarill.gif" alt="Azumarill" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/azumarill"><strong>Azumarill</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 50 Atk / 80 Def / 50 SpA / 80 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Abilities: Thick Fat / Huge Power / Sap Sipper</p>

<p>Thanks to Huge Power doubling its Attack stat to be on the level of powerhouses like Rayquaza, Azumarill is among the most powerful physical attackers in the tier, along with being the best physical Water-type in the tier. Azumarill makes a great Choice Band user, which truly showcases Azumarill's absolutely destructive potential. Priority Aqua Jet is another positive trait for Azumarill, because while relatively weak, it can pick off frailer or weakened Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/bisharp.gif" alt="Bisharp" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Bisharp"><strong>Bisharp</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 125 Atk / 100 Def / 60 SpA / 70 SpD / 70 Spe<br />
Abilities: Inner Focus / Defiant / Pressure</p>

<p>Although UU is full of Fighting- and Fire-types, Bisharp manages to sustain a decent niche as one of the few offensive Dark-types in the tier. This is all in part due to a coveted Steel typing that grants multiple set-up opportunities with Swords Dance and STAB Sucker Punch. Thanks to its high base 125 Attack, Bisharp becomes lethal when set-up, and it can destroy much of the tier with its boosted attacks. Defiant is a good ability as well, making Intimidate users such as Qwilfish rendered as set-up fodder.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/cinccino.gif" alt="Cinccino" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Cinccino"><strong>Cinccino</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 95 Atk / 60 Def / 65 SpA / 60 SpD / 115 Spe<br />
Abilities: Cute Charm / Technician / Skill Link</p>

<p>Thanks to Skill Link, Cinccino has the potential to be a major threat to any team with its multiple-hitting moves that can break through Focus Sash and Substitutes. Cinccino's excellent 115 Speed, along with a decent 95 Attack, allow Cinccino to smash offensive teams with its good coverage and strong attacks. It can also gain momentum for teams with U-turn, which allows Cinccino to pivot out of a bad situation.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/cobalion.gif" alt="Cobalion" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Cobalion"><strong>Cobalion</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 91 HP / 90 Atk / 129 Def / 90 SpA / 72 SpD / 108 Spe<br />
Ability: Justified</p>

<p>Cobalion can stand out from other Fighting-types with its great 108 base Speed and unique typing that grants it a 4x resistance to Stealth Rock as well as a good slew of resistances. This makes Cobalion a very usable Swords Dance sweeper, which can mitigate its somewhat lackluster Attack to very sweepable levels. Thanks to a usable 90 base Special Attack, Cobalion can run Hidden Power Ice for Gligar on the Swords Dance set, as well as becoming a viable Calm Mind attacker. Cobalion also has access to some interesting supportive moves, such as Stealth Rock and Volt Switch. Combine that with a high 129 base Defense, and Cobalion can perform a defensive role very well.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/cofagrigus.gif" alt="Cofagrigus" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Cofagrigus"><strong>Cofagrigus</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 58 HP / 50 Atk / 145 Def / 95 SpA / 105 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Ability: Mummy</p>

<p>Cofagrigus has become a common sight in UU thanks to the influx of Fighting-types in the tier, which makes it a popular choice for teams. Thanks to a high base 145 Defense and good base 95 Special Attack, Cofagrigus can switch into all Fighting-types with the exception being Scrafty and become threatening by using an offensive Trick Room set. Offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus can turn the tides of a battle by setting up Trick Room and a Nasty Plot, creating a potential threat that can do major damage. It gets perfect coverage with Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting, making it tough to wall as well.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/crobat.gif" alt="Crobat" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/crobat"><strong>Crobat</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 85 HP / 90 Atk / 80 Def / 70 SpA / 80 SpD / 130 Spe<br />
Abilities: Inner Focus / Infiltrator</p>

<p>Crobat's unique typing gives it great resistances to Fighting, Grass, and Bug, making it a very good switch-in to the main attacks of Scrafty, Shaymin, Heracross, and Yanmega. Thanks to its base 130 Speed and access to moves such as Roost and Taunt, Crobat can perform the role of a stallbreaker very well. Crobat is no slouch offensively, as access to Brave Bird and a decent base 90 Attack that makes it a good candidate for a Choice Band set. Crobat can also get out of an unfavorable situation via U-turn, which can help gain momentum for your team.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/crustle.gif" alt="Crustle" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/crustle"><strong>Crustle</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 95 Atk / 125 Def / 65 SpA / 75 SpD / 45 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sturdy / Shell Armor / Weak Armor</p>

<p>Crustle's niche lies in that is one of the better suicide lead entry hazard setters in UU. Thanks to Sturdy acting like a pseudo-Focus Sash, Crustle can activate a Custap Berry and easily get up at least Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Crustle is no slouch offensively, as it is capable of threatening some annoying Pokemon such as Crobat and Xatu, which can both be a hindrance towards hazard stacking. Crustle can pull its weight on offensive teams needing a good hazard setter, and it makes a decent choice for any team wanting its valuable support.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/darmanitan.gif" alt="Darmanitan" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Darmanitan/ou"><strong>Darmanitan</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 105 HP / 140 Atk / 55 Def / 30 SpA / 55 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sheer Force / Zen Mode</p>

<p>Darmanitan is simply a nuke that can easily wreck the majority of the tier. Thanks to Sheer Force and a gigantic base 140 Attack, Darmanitan's Life Orb Flare Blitz is among the strongest attacks in UU, which allows it to break through anything that doesn't resist it and have good physical defense. Choice Scarf Darmanitan also performs relatively well, being able to clean up weakened teams with Flare Blitz, while sitting comfortably ahead of Choice Scarf Heracross and Krookodile. Darmanitan's access to U-turn allows to escape out of an incredibly unfavorable situation, which can be useful for gaining momentum.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/druddigon.gif" alt="Druddigon" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Druddigon"><strong>Druddigon</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 77 HP / 120 Atk / 90 Def / 60 SpA / 90 SpD / 48 Spe<br />
Abilities: Rough Skin / Sheer Force / Mold Breaker</p>

<p>Druddigon is one of the few viable Dragon types in UU, and it can perform excellently in the tier. Thanks to a monster base 120 Attack, Druddigon is the strongest Dragon in the tier, making it a beastly Choice Band user. No Pokemon in the UU tier can safely switch into Druddigon without taking major damage because of its absolutely destructive nature; even Bronzong, the nemesis for Flygon, which is Druddigon's major competition, cannot handle Druddigon because of Mold Breaker Earthquake. Druddigon can even go a more defensive route and become a reliable Stealth Rock setter that is able to spread paralysis with Glare, while effectively combating the physical Fire-types of the tier courtesy of its typing.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/durant.gif" alt="Durant" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/durant"><strong>Durant</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 58 HP / 109 Atk / 112 Def / 48 SpA / 48 SpD / 109 Spe<br />
Abilities: Swarm / Hustle / Truant</p>

<p>Durant's numerous positive traits, such as its Hustle-boosted base 109 Attack and excellent 109 Speed, make it a Pokemon to watch out for. Thanks to Hone Claws, Durant can negate the drop in accuracy that Hustle brings along, while instantaneously becoming a substantial threat when set up. Choice Band Durant is another very viable set, allowing Durant to not feel forced to set up and wreck a good portion of the tier with its Hustle-boosted attacks. Durant, when used correctly, can definitely sweep when the right Pokemon are out of the way.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/escavalier.gif" alt="Escavalier" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/escavalier"><strong>Escavalier</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 135 Atk / 105 Def / 60 SpA / 105 SpD / 20 Spe<br />
Abilities: Swarm / Shell Armor / Overcoat</p>

<p>Escavalier's titanic base 135 Attack, along with good 70 / 105 / 105 defenses and a great Steel / Bug typing make it a threat to watch out for in any UU match. These numerous positive traits make Escavalier a brilliant nuke with a Choice Band STAB Megahorn and Iron Head, while being able to combat some extremely relevant threats, such as Weavile and Shaymin. Escavalier can perform a defensive role as well, courtesy of its numerous resistances and great bulk that makes it shine when combating numerous amounts of Pokemon relevant in UU.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/flygon.gif" alt="Flygon" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/flygon"><strong>Flygon</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 100 Atk / 80 Def / 80 SpA / 80 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Flygon is one of the few viable Dragons in UU, and it makes its mark as one of the best offensive threats. Thanks to a great STAB combination being resisted by only Bronzong in UU, Flygon can threaten a wide variety of Pokemon in UU with its Choice Band-boosted attacks. Resistance to all entry hazards due to Levitate and a Ground typing makes Flygon one of the few Pokemon that is not worn down easily by hazards. Flygon is also a cut above a whole slew of Pokemon with a base 100 Speed that allows it to outspeed Darmanitan, Roserade, and neutral Kingdra. This can also make Flygon a decent candidate for a classic Choice Scarf set. While it may not be an best option for a Choice Scarf user, it has its advantages over Mienshao because of its overall better bulk and unique resistances and immunities.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/gallade.gif" alt="Gallade" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/gallade"><strong>Gallade</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 68 HP / 125 Atk / 65 Def / 65 SpA / 115 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Abilities: Steadfast / Justified</p>

<p>Gallade may look helplessly outclassed by the other common Fighting-types of the tier, but it does have a few tricks up its sleeves that can help distinguish it from its competition. Firstly, Gallade has access to a secondary Psychic STAB, which is useful considering the rise in popularity of Poison-types in UU that will get destroyed by Gallade's Psycho Cut. This makes Gallade a fearsome Swords Dance attacker capable of destroying many things that other Fighting-types struggle against with the appropriate move. For example, Gligar is OHKOed by a +2 Ice Punch, while Cofagrigus is 2HKOed by +2 Psycho Cut, and thanks to Gallade's good Special Defense, it can take a Shadow Ball and retaliate with another Psycho Cut.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/galvantula.gif" alt="Galvantula" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/galvantula"><strong>Galvantula</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 77 Atk / 60 Def / 97 SpA / 60 SpD / 108 Spe<br />
Abilities: Compoundeyes / Unnerve / Swarm</p>

<p>Galvantula seems purely outclassed at first glance, considering Raikou and Zapdos have higher Special Attack and much better bulk. However, Galvantula has overall better coverage than both with STAB Bug Buzz to hit Shaymin and Psychic-types, Giga Drain to hit Rhyperior and Swampert for massive damage, the two biggest pains to Raikou and Zapdos, and Hidden Power Ice to smack Gligar and Flygon. Galvantula also has access to Compoundeyes Thunder, which hits harder than a Life Orb Zapdos Thunderbolt given the higher Base Power. Its high base Speed also puts it above many metagame relevant threats, such as Mienshao and Zapdos itself.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/368.gif" alt="Gorebyss" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Gorebyss/ou"><strong>Gorebyss</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 84 Atk / 105 Def / 114 SpA / 75 SpD / 52 Spe<br />
Abilities: Swift Swim / Hydration</p>

<p>Gorebyss is one of only three Pokemon that has the combination of Shell Smash, the best boosting move in the game, and Baton Pass, which can give a powerhouse of the tier to shine because of its increased offensive stats. Gorebyss's main draw over Smeargle, its main SmashPass competitor, is more offensive prowess, which allows Gorebyss to threaten anything that may switch in if needed thanks to its high 114 Special Attack. SmashPass may not be as popular or threatening as it once was in early BW, but Gorebyss still makes a very viable user of the deadly combination and is definitely something to watch out for.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/heracross.gif" alt="Heracross" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Heracross"><strong>Heracross</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 125 Atk / 75 Def / 40 SpA / 95 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Guts / Swarm / Moxie</p>

<p>Heracross is one of the defining, if not the defining, Pokemon in UU. With a toy gained from BW2 in Moxie along with a high base 125 Attack, Choice Scarf Heracross is among the best late-game cleaners of the tier. With access to a Bug STAB in Megahorn, Heracross can heavily damage Slowbro, which is a thorn in the side to the majority of other common Fighting-types. It isn't exactly one dimensional either; a Swords Dance set can easily set up on common Choice Scarf Heracross counters, such as Gligar, while a Choice Band set can do massive damage to the majority of the tier.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/hitmonlee.gif" alt="Hitmonlee" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Hitmonlee"><strong>Hitmonlee</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 120 Atk / 53 Def / 35 SpA / 110 SpD / 87 Spe<br />
Abilities: Limber / Reckless / Unburden</p>

<p>Hitmonlee seems outclassed at first glance, due to the other Fighting-types having more defined niches compared to it. Hitmonlee does have a unique niche though, as it can become a Reversal sweeper thanks to Endure and an excellent ability in Unburden, which will activate after a Liechi Berry boost, making Hitmonlee a fearsome sweeper capable of wiping the floor with opposing teams. Unfortunately for Hitmonlee, the metagame is somewhat hostile with many common answers to Fighting-types in Cofagrigus and Slowbro, which gives Hitmonlee headaches.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/honchkrow.gif" alt="Honchkrow" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Honchkrow"><strong>Honchkrow</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 125 Atk / 52 Def / 105 SpA / 52 SpD / 71 Spe<br />
Abilities: Insomnia / Super Luck / Moxie</p>

<p>Honchkrow is a terrific offensive Pokemon, thanks to its high offensive stats along with an excellent ability in Moxie. With access to STAB Sucker Punch as well as a powerful Brave Bird, Honchkrow can hit like a truck as well as sweep offensive teams when obtaining Moxie boosts. Honchkrow's movepool options have widened since BW2, giving it Superpower and Heat Wave along with Moxie, making it even harder to wall. The key for Honchkrow is to get that first Moxie boost, which can lead to a snowball effect that can ultimately sweep weakened teams.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/houndoom.gif" alt="Houndoom" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Houndoom"><strong>Houndoom</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 90 Atk / 50 Def / 110 SpA / 80 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Early Bird / Flash Fire / Unnerve</p>

<p>Houndoom has good offensive stats, with 90 / 110 / 95 offenses being above average in the tier. This makes Houndoom a good candidate for a mixed set, in which it can play mind games with its opponents with Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Houndoom is also a viable Nasty Plot sweeper, which bolsters its Special Attack to relatively high levels. Houndoom may not be very good in this current metagame because of numerous flaws, but its unique niches are something that players may desire when building a team.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/kingdra.gif" alt="Kingdra" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Kingdra"><strong>Kingdra</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 95 Atk / 95 Def / 95 SpA / 95 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Swift Swim / Sniper / Damp</p>

<p>Kingdra is among the best Pokemon in UU, thanks to its unique Water / Dragon typing that gives it only one weakness and a destructive STAB combination. Kingdra's well balanced offensive stats allow it to perform well both physically and specially. This makes Empoleon and Slowking the only fail-safe counters to Kingdra in the tier due its incredible versatility. Kingdra's Substitute + Dragon Dance set can set up on many Pokemon due to its great resistances while avoiding status that Kingdra despises. Thanks to Dragon Dance and a good STAB combination, Kingdra is able to dent Pokemon heavily with its STAB Outrage and Waterfall. Kingdra can also perform well as a deadly Rain Dance sweeper, which destroys the majority of the tier with its rain-boosted Hydro Pumps while easily outspeeding everything in the tier, including Choice Scarf Mienshao. Kingdra's other options include an offensive Dragon Dance set that can reach even higher potential than the Substitute + Dragon Dance set with a potential double boost from Rain Dance or the ability to hit Slowbro hard with a Draco Meteor. A Choice Specs set is also viable even without rain support, and a ChestoRest set that can Rest off annoying status increases Kingdra's longevity. Kingdra's phenomenal traits make it a Pokemon that is well deserving of being among the best Pokemon in the tier that is key to watch out for.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/krookodile.gif" alt="Krookodile" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Krookodile"><strong>Krookodile</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 117 Atk / 70 Def / 65 SpA / 75 SpD / 92 Spe<br />
Abilities: Intimidate / Moxie / Anger Point</p>

<p>Thanks to Moxie and relatively good attacking stats, Krookodile can perform very well as a revenge killer and a possible cleaner. Krookodile has access to Pursuit as well, which helps put Pokemon such as Azelf and Mew in a checkmate situation. However, Krookodile has its flaws. The metagame is very hostile towards it, with the ridiculous popularity of Choice Scarf Mienshao and Heracross, both of which can destroy Krookodile with their STAB moves, and in Heracross's case, resist both STABs and give Krookodile competition as a Moxie cleaner. Krookodile also lacks good bulk and typing, with plenty of common weaknesses as well as having a tough time switching into any remotely strong hit.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/lilligant.gif" alt="Lilligant" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/lilligant"><strong>Lilligant</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 60 Atk / 75 Def / 110 SpA / 75 SpD / 90 Spe<br />
Abilities: Chlorophyll / Own Tempo / Leaf Guard</p>

<p>Lilligant's main draw over other Grass-types is its access to the rare Quiver Dance, an excellent boosting move that makes Lilligant an incredible threat after a boost or two. Lilligant also has Sleep Powder to put something to sleep to increase the ease of setting up several Quiver Dances. Lilligant can even opt for the raw power that Petal Dance offers over a reliable STAB in Giga Drain, and because of Own Tempo, Lilligant will not get confused after the sequence ends.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/machamp.gif" alt="Machamp" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/machamp"><strong>Machamp</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 130 Atk / 80 Def / 65 SpA / 85 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Abilities: Guts / No Guard / Steadfast</p>

<p>Other Fighting-types have several advantages that make them better choices for their offensive teams over Machamp; Heracross has Moxie and the ability to set up on so-called counters, Mienshao hits brutally hard with Hi Jump Kick and creates the benchmark for Choice Scarf users, Scrafty has an excellent STAB combination, while Cobalion and Virizion have much higher Speed that makes them both capable of being Swords Dance sweepers. Machamp's niche is getting harder to see, but its access to a perfectly accurate No Guard DynamicPunch that always confuses, along with its excellent base 130 Attack and better bulk than a majority of Fighting-types, keep it somewhat relevant in UU. Machamp can use Substitute and Bulk Up sets to a very capable degree, as both can immensely threaten a good amount of Pokemon in UU.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/magneton.gif" alt="Magneton" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/magneton"><strong>Magneton</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 65 Atk / 95 Def / 120 SpA / 70 SpD / 70 Spe<br />
Abilities: Magnet Pull / Sturdy / Analytic</p>

<p>Steel-types are a lot less common down in UU than they are in OU, and this dampers Magneton's Steel trapping capabilities somewhat. Due to the lack of viable Steel-types, Magneton may not be the premier choice for your team, considering the better offensive Electric-types of the tier. However, Magneton can easily trap the most common Steel-type, Bronzong, with the combination of Magnet Rise and Substitute that makes Bronzong incapable of breaking Magneton's Substitutes without multiple Gyro Balls, while getting withered down with repeated Thunderbolts. Magneton can also make quick work of the faster Steel-types that roam the tier with a Choice Scarf set; while this set lacks the ability to destroy Bronzong, it can revenge kill Cobalion and Durant easily with a Hidden Power Fire. Magneton isn't limited to trapping, as a Choice Specs set with Analytic can destroy even the bulkiest of walls, which makes Magneton a very capable wallbreaker. Although Magneton's niche as a Steel killer is somewhat small, it is the only Pokemon capable of performing that niche and doing it well.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/medicham.gif" alt="Medicham" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/medicham"><strong>Medicham</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 60 Atk / 75 Def / 60 SpA / 75 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Abilities: Pure Power / Telepathy</p>

<p>Medicham's access to Pure Power keeps it from hitting absolute obscurity, as it is a really poor Pokemon otherwise. With its Attack stat doubled, Medicham is a true powerhouse, for lack of a better term. Medicham performs well as a Choice Band user in conjunction with Choice Scarf Heracross, as Medicham is capable of eliminating all common answers to Heracross with the appropriate move. This gives Medicham a great niche in helping out one of the biggest threats in UU reach its full potential.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/meloetta.gif" alt="Meloetta" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/meloetta"><strong>Meloetta</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 77 Atk / 77 Def / 128 SpA / 128 SpD / 90 Spe<br />
Ability: Serene Grace</p>

<p>Meloetta's terrific base 128 Special Attack and Special Defense stats, along with its unique typing that grants it a Ghost immunity, give it an advantage over its fellow special attacking Psychic-types Azelf and Mew. This makes Meloetta a great offensive Calm Mind user that hits brutally hard after one or two boosts. Meloetta also performs a Choice Specs set exceptionally well, being able to destroy many Pokemon with its boosted attacks. A Substitute + Calm Mind set is also viable, using Meloetta's great special stats to great potential, while its typing is something that gives Meloetta an advantage over Raikou, its main competitor for the role.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/mienshao.gif" alt="Mienshao" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/mienshao"><strong>Mienshao</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 125 Atk / 60 Def / 95 SpA / 60 SpD / 105 Spe<br />
Abilities: Inner Focus / Regenerator / Reckless</p>

<p>Mienshao is one of the premier Fighting-types in the UU tier. With an excellent 105 base Speed and high 125 base Attack, Mienshao is by far the best user of Choice Scarf in the tier. Mienshao is also capable of using a Life Orb set to a very capable degree, and as an extra bonus, it can get rid of Gligar with a swift Hidden Power Ice thanks to its decent 95 Special Attack. It also has two excellent abilities in Regenerator and Reckless; the former helps regain lost health, which is especially helpful when using the Life Orb set, while the latter boosts Hi Jump Kick's power to unimaginable heights. Mienshao also has access to U-turn and Baton Pass, which helps it get out of an unfavorable situation and maneuver around its common answers.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/mismagius.gif" alt="Mismagius" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/mismagius"><strong>Mismagius</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 60 Atk / 60 Def / 105 SpA / 105 SpD / 105 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Mismagius is often shafted in favor of the bulkier Cofagrigus, which can combat the Fighting-types that Mismagius could even lose to because of its somewhat poor physical bulk. Despite new competition, Mismagius still has a niche of being a fast set-up sweeper, which can be advantageous considering that Cofagrigus is forced to use Trick Room if it so desires to sweep. Mismagius also has access to Levitate, which makes it the most entry hazard resistant Ghost, as well as some useful support moves in Thunder Wave and Heal Bell, meaning it isn't completely outclassed by Cofagrigus and Sableye as a defensive Ghost.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/nidoking.gif" alt="Nidoking" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Nidoking"><strong>Nidoking</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 81 HP / 92 Atk / 77 Def / 85 SpA / 75 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Poison Point / Rivalry / Sheer Force</p>

<p>Nidoking is a very powerful offensive threat, as its fantastic movepool and good attacking stats are augmented by Sheer Force. This makes Nidoking a brilliant offensive threat that can thrive once given a switch in. If you desire a fully offensive Pokemon that can nuke even the best special walls with its brutal attacks, look no further than Nidoking.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/nidoqueen.gif" alt="Nidoqueen" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Nidoqueen"><strong>Nidoqueen</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 82 Atk / 87 Def / 75 SpA / 85 SpD / 76 Spe<br />
Abilities: Poison Point / Rivalry / Sheer Force</p>

<p>Nidoqueen's unique resistances, including valuable resistances to Fighting, Bug, and an immunity to Electric, and access to Stealth Rock in conjunction with Sheer Force, has made Nidoqueen very popular. Nidoqueen performs the role of a bulky offensive Stealth Rock setter very well, as it is capable of threatening the metagame with its excellent movepool while discouraging the spinners and Xatu from coming in because they fail to take multiple hits from the appropriate move. The resistances that Nidoqueen has are even more important considering the popularity of Heracross and Mienshao, which are both handled by Nidoqueen. If you need a more defensive route to Nidoqueen, though, a defensive set is still viable and becomes an even better answer to the omnipresent Fighting-types.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/omastar.gif" alt="Omastar" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/omastar"><strong>Omastar</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 60 Atk / 125 Def / 115 SpA / 70 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Abilities: Swift Swim / Shell Armor / Weak Armor</p>

<p>Omastar's access to Shell Smash, one of the best boosting moves, makes it a formidable sweeper that can destroy teams after the right Pokemon are out of the way. Omastar's high base 115 Special Attack is nothing to scoff at, as with a Shell Smash boost, Omastar's Hydro Pumps destroy everything in the tier that doesn't resist it. Omastar can also use its Dream World ability, Weak Armor, to great potential, since if it switches into a Choice-locked Flare Blitz or a weak physical attack, and boosts with Shell Smash, it will be able to outspeed Choice Scarf Mienshao, the troubling Pokemon for most set up sweepers. Omastar can also run a support set, putting its high base 125 Defense and access to Stealth Rock and Spikes to good use.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/porygon-z.gif" alt="Porygon-Z" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Porygon-Z"><strong>Porygon-Z</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 85 HP / 80 Atk / 70 Def / 135 SpA / 75 SpD / 90 Spe<br />
Abilities: Download / Adaptability / Analytic</p>

<p>Porygon-Z, unlike its pre-evolution Porygon2, was made for sweeping with its super high base 135 Special Attack along with terrific abilities in Adaptability and Download. Agility Porygon-Z is a substantial threat in UU, as its ability to clean weakened teams is remarkable when backed by a Download boost. Another way to patch up Porygon-Z's meager Speed is a Choice Scarf set that can be a capable revenge killer. If you want Porygon-Z to wallbreak, though, Choice Specs and Nasty Plot sets with Adaptability are particularly destructive to even the bulkiest of special walls.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/raikou.gif" alt="Raikou" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/raikou"><strong>Raikou</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 85 Atk / 75 Def / 115 SpA / 100 SpD / 115 Spe<br />
Ability: Pressure</p>

<p>Raikou is among the most threatening offensive Pokemon in the tier, and that is due to its high base 115 Special Attack and Speed stats. Raikou makes the best candidate for a Substitute + Calm Mind set that is capable of setting up and threatening a great majority of Pokemon in the tier. Raikou is also capable of using Choice Specs to a great degree as well, as it can forgo the need to set-up and just hit hard right off the bat. Life Orb and Choice Scarf sets are also somewhat decent, as they both have their uses that can thrive when used correctly.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/rhyperior.gif" alt="Rhyperior" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/rhyperior"><strong>Rhyperior</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 115 HP / 140 Atk / 130 Def / 55 SpA / 55 SpD / 40 Spe<br />
Abilities: Solid Rock / Lightningrod / Reckless</p>

<p>Rhyperior thrives as a solid counter to Raikou and Zapdos, two major threats in the tier, and this is all due in part to Solid Rock, which patches up Rhyperior's weak Special Defense. Thanks to Solid Rock, standard tank Rhyperior can even stomach a Life Orb Hidden Power Grass from offensive Zapdos, and it can KO both Raikou and Zapdos with Earthquake and Rock Blast, respectively. Rhyperior can also answer the physical Fire-types of the tier thanks to its overall high Defense, while being able to set up Stealth Rock on the opposing side. Rhyperior is definitely no slouch on the offensive side, as a base 140 Attack is among the highest in UU, which allows Rhyperior to run solid Choice Band and Rock Polish sets along with a STAB EdgeQuake combination.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/roserade.gif" alt="Roserade" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/roserade"><strong>Roserade</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 70 Atk / 65 Def / 125 SpA / 105 SpD / 90 Spe<br />
Abilities: Natural Cure / Poison Point / Technician</p>

<p>Roserade may have fallen out of the top spot in UU, but it is foolish to think of it as a non-threat these days. Roserade's high base 125 Special Attack and relatively decent base 90 Speed allows it to hit like a truck with its brutal STAB Leaf Storms and Sludge Bombs. Roserade is capable of putting a counter to sleep as well with its access to Sleep Powder. Roserade also has access to Spikes, which are invaluable to the UU metagame. Due to its good Special Defense and Natural Cure, Roserade can also choose to go a defensive route in order to handle bulky Water-types relatively well and lay layers of Spikes down.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/rotom-c.gif" alt="Rotom-C" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Rotom-C"><strong>Rotom-C</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:50 HP / 65 Atk / 107 Def / 105 SpA / 107 SpD / 86 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Rotom-C's unique Grass / Electric typing and Levitate offers it great resistances to Water, Electric, and an immunity to Ground attacks. This allows it to combat several very relevant defensive Pokemon, such as Rhyperior, Swampert, and Slowbro. Rotom-C is best used as a Choice Scarf user that utilizes its nice base 86 Speed to barely outrun Heracross and Nidoking, which is always useful, while maintaining excellent momentum with Volt Switch and messing with its counters with Trick. Rotom-C can also perform a defensive role well too, considering its ability to combat bulky Water-types, access to Will-O-Wisp, and overall decent bulk. If you want absolute raw power, though, Choice Specs Rotom-C can destroy common Pokemon that don't resist its Grass STAB with Leaf Storm. Since Rotom-C is so commonly seen as a Choice Pokemon, it can even catch them off guard with an Expert Belt set, which can effectively eliminate annoying Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Swampert, which can then open up opportunities for other Pokemon to thrive.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/rotom-h.gif" alt="Rotom-H" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Rotom-H"><strong>Rotom-H</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:50 HP / 65 Atk / 107 Def / 105 SpA / 107 SpD / 86 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Rotom-H has seven resistances and a decent Special Attack, allowing it to come in easily and deal out significant damage. Rotom-H performs best as a Choice Specs user that can nuke the tier with its powerful attacks, and thanks to its good STAB combination, Rotom-H is capable of denting everything in the tier with its STAB Overheat and can wither down bulky Water-types with Volt Switch. Rotom-H also sits at a good Speed tier for a Choice Scarf set, being able to outspeed key threats such as Heracross and Nidoking. Rotom-H can also cripple some of its common switch-ins with a Trick or burn them with a surprise Will-O-Wisp.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/sceptile.gif" alt="Sceptile" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Sceptile"><strong>Sceptile</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 85 Atk / 65 Def / 105 SpA / 85 SpD / 120 Spe<br />
Abilities: Overgrow / Unburden</p>

<p>Sceptile seems to be outclassed by other offensive Grass-types, such as Shaymin, Roserade, and Lilligant, all of which have their own unique perks over it. But Sceptile has a niche in that it is the only viable Grass-type Swords Dance sweeper in the tier. Sceptile is significantly faster than a wide majority of the tier, being outsped by only Weavile and Crobat, although standard Crobat only runs enough Speed to outspeed Azelf, which can allow Sceptile to outspeed and KO with a +2 Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Speaking of Acrobatics, it allows Sceptile to get around opposing Grass-types and makes it nearly impossible to revenge kill without taking too much damage. Sceptile can even run a special attacking set because of its high Speed, which can put dents in some common Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/scolipede.gif" alt="Scolipede" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Scolipede"><strong>Scolipede</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 90 Atk / 89 Def / 55 SpA / 69 SpD / 112 Spe<br />
Abilities: Poison Point / Swarm / Quick Feet</p>

<p>Scolipede has access to Spikes, which is always a good thing in UU considering how valuable Spikers are. Scolipede's main advantage over Accelgor is its powerful STAB Megahorn that can leave dents in many Pokemon. Scolipede is also relatively fast, being able to outspeed key threats such as Mienshao and Mew, allowing it to lay even more Spikes in front of them or heavily dent them.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/scrafty.gif" alt="Scrafty" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Scrafty"><strong>Scrafty</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 90 Atk / 115 Def / 45 SpA / 115 SpD / 58 Spe<br />
Abilities: Shed Skin / Moxie / Intimidate</p>

<p>Scrafty's brilliant STAB combination is only resisted by Heracross in UU and makes it a formidable offensive threat. Even though Scrafty has a middling Speed stat, it makes up for that with Dragon Dance, which can make it a very offensive threat with Moxie. Scrafty can also perform a more defensively inclined role with Bulk Up, being able to set up on a good amount of defensive Pokemon thanks to Shed Skin and allowing for Rest to be a good option for recovery because of the 30% chance to wake up early. If you want Scrafty to hit hard right off the bat, Choice Band Scrafty is able to do that, with its extra coverage helping it against certain threats that it can't cover with a Dragon Dance set as well as hitting immediately hard, being able to 2HKO even defensive Swampert.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/sharpedo.gif" alt="Sharpedo" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Sharpedo"><strong>Sharpedo</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 120 Atk / 40 Def / 95 SpA / 40 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Rough Skin / Speed Boost</p>

<p>Sharpedo was never really a great offensive threat in past generations, as its extreme frailty and poor defensive typing left it outclassed. However, with Speed Boost thanks to Dream World, Sharpedo is among UU's biggest offensive threats. Sharpedo's most common set is a physical sweeper that can hit the metagame hard with its Life Orb-boosted Waterfall and Crunch. Sharpedo also can do the surprising role of a special sweeper that is capable of beating a good number of Pokemon that can otherwise combat the physical set. As the Speed boosts stack up, Sharpedo suddenly becomes harder to revenge kill and can tear up weakened teams, making it one of the best cleaners in the tier.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/shaymin.gif" alt="Shaymin" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Shaymin"><strong>Shaymin</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 100 Atk / 100 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Ability: Natural Cure</p>

<p>Shaymin is the best answer to Water-types available in the tier, being able to handle Scald burns thanks to Natural Cure and its overall balanced stats. Shaymin makes an excellent offensive Pokemon as well, with access to STAB Seed Flare that has a 40% chance to drop a Pokemon's Special Defense by 2 stages, which can force the special walls of the tier to switch or take the fall. Shaymin also has access to some great coverage moves that can dent switch-ins hard, such as Earth Power to smack Fire-types and Psychic to heavily dent Heracross and Crobat switch-ins.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/smeargle.gif" alt="Smeargle" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Smeargle"><strong>Smeargle</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 20 Atk / 35 Def / 20 SpA / 45 SpD / 75 Spe<br />
Abilities: Own Tempo / Technician / Moody</p>

<p>Smeargle's atrocious stats may make it seem like it is completely out of place in UU, but its unique traits give it a niche that not many other Pokemon can perform as well. Thanks to Sketch, Smeargle can utilize every move at its disposal, which can make it a great Baton Passer or hazard setter. Smeargle is one of three Pokemon with the famed SmashPass combination, and its access to Spore to incapacitate a foe along with a good Speed stat give it an advantage over Gorebyss. When Baton Passed, the SmashPass recipient can reach immense offensive potential that allows it to possibly sweep teams. Smeargle also performs the role of setting hazards down very well. While other hazard setters may have better offensive prowess, Smeargle has access to Spore, which guarantees that a Pokemon is crippled along with getting hazards up. Unfortunately, Smeargle's stats don't allow for much else to use in its movepool, but its incredible support is something that is desired for any offensive UU team.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/snorlax.gif" alt="Snorlax" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Snorlax"><strong>Snorlax</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 160 HP / 110 Atk / 65 Def / 65 SpA / 110 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Abilities: Thick Fat / Immunity / Gluttony</p>

<p>Snorlax is one of the best Pokemon in UU, and it's not hard to see why. Snorlax has a meaty base 160 HP, along with a good base 110 Attack and Special Defense. These attributes make Snorlax an excellent offensive check to the majority of threatening special attackers, such as Raikou and offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus. Snorlax can also perform well as both an offensive and defensive Curse sweeper. Even though Umbreon performs better at being a special wall thanks to Wish and Heal Bell, Snorlax can perform a RestTalk set, which has Whirlwind, a major advantage over Umbreon. Snorlax's phenomenal traits make it among the most valuable Pokemon in UU, and it can find a place on any team needing its excellent special bulk.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/togekiss.gif" alt="Togekiss" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Togekiss"><strong>Terrrakion</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 85 HP / 50 Atk / 95 Def / 120 SpA / 115 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Abilities: Hustle / Serene Grace / Super Luck</p>

<p>Togekiss is among the most annoying Pokemon in the tier with its 60% chance to flinch the opponent with Air Slash thanks to Serene Grace. But an annoying Pokemon is also an excellent Pokemon in its own merits, as Togekiss's 85 / 95 / 115 bulk gives it impressive mixed bulk, along with reliable recovery in Roost and great supporting moves such as Heal Bell and Thunder Wave. With access to Nasty Plot and a relatively high Special Attack, Togekiss is no slouch offensively either, being able to hit the tier for decent damage with its Air Slashes. Togekiss's best set is a physically defensive set that can set up several Nasty Plots because of the extra bulk given, as well as wreck stall with Heal Bell to heal status or Thunder Wave to use the famous paraflinch combination to great success. Togekiss can also take on a specially defensive role with the same set, which takes advantage of Togekiss's higher Special Defense. Togekiss is a Pokemon that can leave its mark as a destructive Pokemon in right hands, and it has earned a spot as a top tier Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/tornadus.gif" alt="Tornadus" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Tornadus"><strong>Tornadus</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 79 HP / 115 Atk / 70 Def / 125 SpA / 80 SpD / 111 Spe<br />
Abilities: Prankster / Defiant</p>

<p>Being shunned out of OU by its Therian form when it demolished OU, Tornadus dropped to the UU tier. While it misses its permanent rain, it is still a threatening Pokemon because of its terrific mixed attacking stats and high base 111 Speed. Tornadus can set up the rain manually, with access to Prankster Rain Dance, which allows it to spam its Hurricanes without having to dread the 70% accuracy. Tornadus has the right amount of coverage moves, being able to destroy Rhyperior with a Grass Knot and Snorlax and Umbreon with Superpower, which essentially equates to limited switch-ins. Tornadus can also perform outside of the rain well, with a Bulk Up set that can use its +1 Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics to annihilate anything that doesn't have high enough physical defense or resists it.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/venomoth.gif" alt="Venomoth" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/venomoth"><strong>Venomoth</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 65 Atk / 60 Def / 90 SpA / 75 SpD / 90 Spe<br />
Abilities: Shield Dust / Tinted Lens / Wonder Skin</p>

<p>Venomoth is brilliant at what it does best, which is Baton Passing Quiver Dances to threatening Pokemon. Venomoth is often a very high-reward low-risk Pokemon with the number of great receivers of Quiver Dance boosts that exists such as Nidoqueen and Togekiss. It doesn't have a dreadful time setting up either, thanks to its access to Sleep Powder to cripple an opposing Pokemon along with its ability Wonder Skin that avoids Roar 50% of the time, which can allow Venomoth to set up multiple Quiver Dances and outright beat the Roar user. Venomoth is an extremely potent Pokemon and can be deadly when given a clean window of opportunity.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/victini.gif" alt="Victini" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Victini/ou"><strong>Victini</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 100 Atk / 100 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Ability: Victory Star</p>

<p>Victini's adorable looks are deceiving, as it is among the deadliest offensive threats in the tier. Victini's signature move, V-create, is ridiculously powerful, and when boosted with a Choice Band, it will often put big dents in anything that lacks good Defense and a resistance. Victini can also smack bulky Water-types exceedingly hard with its newly gained Bolt Strike, and it can also U-turn out if a counter is sent to handle it. Victini's best counters to its Choice Band set, such as Rhyperior and Swampert, all are destroyed by a more specially based set with Grass Knot to annihilate them all. Victini is extremely potent with its special set with a strong special STAB in Blue Flare, while luring in its typical counters and wrecking them with the appropriate coverage move. Victini can even run V-create on its special set to fool its slower counters into thinking its a physical set, then destroying them with a Grass Knot or even a Thunder, if you are willing to play risky, to have a chance to OHKO Slowbro as well as 2HKO Slowking. V-create also has the plus of 2HKOing Umbreon even without investment, an impressive feat that leaves Snorlax as the only secure counter to the special attacking Victini. Snorlax itself is destroyed by a Choice Band V-create, so Victini in that sense lacks solid counters. Victini can surprise you in many ways that could put a big hole in your defensive coverage.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/virizion.gif" alt="Virizion" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Virizion"><strong>Virizion</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:91 HP / 90 Atk / 72 Def / 90 SpA / 129 SpD / 108 Spe<br />
Ability: Justified</p>

<p>In a tier filled to the brim with Fighting-types, Virizion can distinguish itself from the pack with its access to Grass STAB to destroy Slowbro, a Pokemon that will often wall the majority of Fighting-types, along with other bulky Water-types. Virizion also has a great base 108 Speed and two excellent set up moves in Swords Dance and Calm Mind, both of which can make Virizion a truly threatening Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/weavile.gif" alt="Weavile" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/weavile"><strong>Weavile</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 70 HP / 120 Atk / 65 Def / 45 SpA / 85 SpD / 125 Spe<br />
Abilities: Pressure / Pickpocket</p>

<p>Weavile is a terrific offensive threat that is capable of cleaning weakened teams late-game thanks to its ridiculously high base 125 Speed and good base 120 Attack. Weavile is best used as a Swords Dance sweeper, as it can pick off frailer Choice Scarf users like Mienshao easily with a +2 Ice Shard, while being capable of threatening the majority of the metagame with its boosted attacks. If you want Weavile to be a more dedicated revenge killer, it can perform that admirably with Pursuit to checkmate Ghost- and Psychic-types when using an all-out attacking set.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/yanmega.gif" alt="Yanmega" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/yanmega"><strong>Yanmega</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 86 HP / 76 Atk / 86 Def / 116 SpA / 56 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Speed Boost / Tinted Lens / Frisk</p>

<p>Yanmega's high base 116 Special Attack along with two excellent abilities in Tinted Lens and Speed Boost make it a capable wallbreaker or sweeper that can destroy opposing teams. Choice Specs Yanmega is a ridiculous powerhouse, as it blows through resists due to Tinted Lens and destroys the majority of the tier bar a few Pokemon. If you want Yanmega to sweep, though, it can perform that role with a simple Life Orb set with Speed Boost to make it so Yanmega becomes harder to revenge kill with every accumulated boost.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/zapdos.gif" alt="Zapdos" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/zapdos"><strong>Zapdos</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 90 Atk / 85 Def / 125 SpA / 90 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Ability: Pressure</p>

<p>Zapdos is among UU's best Pokemon, and this is all due in part to its great stats that allow it to perform as an offensive or defensive threat, making it very versatile. Zapdos's best set utilizes its highest stats to the fullest, with a Life Orb set that is capable of doing great damage with its decent coverage and powerful Thunderbolts, while outspeeding key threats such as Kingdra and Nidoking. Zapdos can also use its ability, Pressure, to great success with a SubRoost set that is capable of taking many powerful hits and forcing them out with a potentially threatening attack, which allows Zapdos to get up a Substitute to avoid status, Roost off any potential damage, and stall out low PP moves like Stone Edge. Zapdos also performs the role of a physically defensive and specially defensive Pokemon as well, being able to use its great bulk to take a hit from the majority of powerful attackers. Zapdos can also bolster its offensive prowess as well with Choice Specs and Agility sets, as the former allows Zapdos to hit even harder than the Life Orb set, while the latter allows Zapdos to boost its Speed to even higher levels which can make it an excellent late-game sweeper.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/zoroark.gif" alt="Zoroark" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/zoroark"><strong>Zoroark</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 105 Atk / 60 Def / 120 SpA / 60 SpD / 105 Spe<br />
Ability: Illusion</p>

<p>Zoroark's unique ability, Illusion, allows it to masquerade as the last member of your team, which can be useful when wanting to bait in a counter for that Pokemon to get beaten by Zoroark. This is especially useful for Fighting-types, who appreciate Zoroark's ability to bait and destroy their typical counters. While Team Preview may make you think initially that this strategy is flawed, you could be thrown through a loop and be forced to think about what Pokemon it truly is. Zoroark's terrific 105 / 120 / 105 offenses allow it to perform well as an offensive Pokemon, whether it be through a Choice Specs set that can hit very hard and cripple defensive Pokemon with Trick, an all-out attacking set, or a Nasty Plot set.</p>

<h2>Defensive Threats</h2>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/amoonguss.gif" alt="Amoonguss" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/amoonguss/ou"><strong>Amoonguss</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:</strong> 114 HP / 85 Atk / 70 Def / 85 SpA / 80 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Abilities: Effect Spore / Regenerator</p>

<p>Thanks to its access to Regenerator and the rare Spore, Amoonguss can stand out among other Grass-types. Amoonguss has valuable resistances to Fighting, Electric, and Water, along with a meaty base 114 HP stat, which allows it to combat some of UU's biggest threats, such as Mienshao and Kingdra.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/blastoise.gif" alt="Blastoise" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Blastoise"><strong>Blastoise</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 79 HP / 83 Atk / 100 Def / 85 SpA / 105 SpD / 78 Spe<br />
Abilities: Torrent / Rain Dish</p>

<p>Having access to the ever useful Rapid Spin gives Blastoise an edge over other bulky Water-types that would otherwise outclass it. Blastoise is the most reliable spinner in UU, having access to moves such as Foresight and Scald to make it annoying for Ghost-types to spinblock against it. Blastoise is no set-up fodder either, with the aforementioned Scald as well as phazing moves in Roar and Dragon Tail. If you desperately need Rapid Spin support, Blastoise will usually be your best choice for the job.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/bronzong.gif" alt="Bronzong" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Bronzong"><strong>Bronzong</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 67 HP / 89 Atk / 116 Def / 79 SpA / 116 SpD / 33 Spe<br />
Abilities: Levitate / Heatproof / Heavy Metal</p>

<p>Bronzong's base 116 defenses and plethora of resistances and immunities make it a good defensive Pokemon that can take on some incredibly threatening Pokemon, such as Flygon, Weavile, and Choice Band Snorlax. Due to its great defenses and amount of opportunities to switch into threatening Pokemon, Bronzong can have many chances to set up Stealth Rock with relative ease. Bronzong also has some great movepool options, such as dual screens and Trick Room.</p>

Base Stats: 60 HP / 70 Atk / 105 Def / 70 SpA / 120 Def / 75 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Claydol's main niche in the UU tier lies in having the treasured Rapid Spin, but it is not a good user of the move. Claydol suffers from extremely low offensive prowess, which means it will struggle massively to get through any of the Ghost-types in the tier. This makes Claydol a very poor spinner in the tier, and by far the most unreliable. Claydol, despite having excellent 60 / 105 / 120 defenses, has many crippling weaknesses to Dark, Bug, Ghost, Ice, and Water attacks, which makes it even mediocre defensively. Even though Claydol has some redeeming factors in resistances to all hazards, access to Stealth Rock, and an Electric immunity, do consider Blastoise, a much better spinner, over Claydol when looking for Rapid Spin support.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/cresselia.gif" alt="Cresselia" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Cresselia"><strong>Cresselia</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 120 HP / 70 Atk / 120 Def / 75 SpA / 130 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Cresselia is among the most sturdy defensive behemoths of the tier. With great 120 / 120 / 130 bulk, Cresselia is able to stomach a huge number of attacks that UU has to offer. Cresselia has some great movepool options as well, such as Thunder Wave and dual screens, that make it a brilliant supporter for all teams. Thanks to Moonlight, Cresselia has a reliable recovery move due to the lack of weather in the tier. Cresselia's amazing bulk and support should not be neglected, as it is among the best defensive Pokemon in the tier.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/dusclops.gif" alt="Dusclops" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/dusclops"><strong>Dusclops</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 40 HP / 70 Atk / 130 Def / 60 SpA / 130 SpD / 25 Spe<br />
Ability: Pressure</p>

<p>Dusclops suffers from many fatal flaws that leave it outclassed by Cofagrigus and other Ghost-types, which are better fits on a majority of teams. Despite having titanic defenses thanks to Eviolite, Dusclops is mediocre overall because it fails to threaten much with its pathetic offenses, having to rely on Night Shade to do any damage to the opposition. However, Dusclops can fit on full stall teams, in which it can use Curse to keep Blastoise and Hitmontop from spinning away Spikes while making the spinners take a considerable amount of damage. If you are in the mood to build a UU team that isn't based around stall, consider Cofagrigus or Sableye before Dusclops, as they have more redeeming factors that make them much more fit for the majority of teams compared to Dusclops.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/empoleon.gif" alt="Empoleon" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/empoleon"><strong>Empoleon</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 84 HP / 86 Atk / 88 Def / 111 SpA / 101 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Abilities: Torrent / Defiant</p>

<p>Empoleon's unique Water / Steel typing gives it a plethora of resistances, while a base 111 Special Attack can make Empoleon a very formidable offensive threat. Thanks to BW2, Empoleon can finally run its classic SubPetaya set with Agility, which can become a formidable sweeper once it hits its full potential with Torrent activated. Empoleon can use its slew of resistances to good use with a specially defensive set capable of easily beating all variants of Kingdra, a rare feat, as well as set up the valuable Stealth Rock. If you want a powerful Empoleon right off the bat with no set up, Choice Specs Empoleon is the set you should be using. Empoleon's true power is showcased here, as offensive Snorlax and defensive Porygon2 are cleanly 2HKOed by Hydro Pump, while Umbreon has a high chance to get 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. While Empoleon may not be the best bulky Water-type or offensive attacker, its unique traits allow it to shine when necessary.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/ferroseed.gif" alt="Ferroseed" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Ferroseed"><strong>Ferroseed</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 44 HP / 50 Atk / 91 Def / 24 SpA / 86 SpD / 10 Spe<br />
Ability: Iron Barbs</p>

<p>Ferroseed looks pathetic at first glance; with extremely poor stats across the board, it looks like a Pokemon never worth using. But with Eviolite equipped, Ferroseed can turn into a surprisingly durable Pokemon that can hold its own in a hostile metagame. Thanks to a Grass / Steel typing, Ferroseed is capable of handling some highly relevant threats, such as Rain Dance Kingdra and many Grass-types. Ferroseed, like its evolution in OU, has several great utility moves that many Pokemon lack, such as Spikes, Thunder Wave, and Leech Seed, which allows it to distinguish itself as a decent support Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/gligar.gif" alt="Gligar" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Gligar"><strong>Gligar</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 75 Atk / 105 Def / 35 SpA / 65 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Hyper Cutter / Sand Veil / Immunity</p>

<p>Gligar's claim to fame is its ability to combat a number of the common Fighting-types in the tier courtesy of its Ground / Flying typing as well as high physical bulk. Gligar is ridiculously bulky on the physical side thanks to Eviolite, allowing it to comfortably take a wide variety of physical hits and Roost off any damage, as well as provide Stealth Rock support. This may all seem extremely appealing, but Gligar has many flaws that make it a subpar choice when looking to combat Fighting-types. Firstly, Gligar will lose to the Fighting-types its supposed to beat when up against Swords Dance Heracross, which can easily set up to +6 on Gligar, and Mienshao, which destroys Gligar with Hidden Power Ice or take advantage of it. If you desperately need something to take physical hits while setting up Stealth Rock, Gligar can work in those situations, but keep in mind that it will often not be the best Pokemon to use as your physical wall because its numerous flaws make it a mediocre Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/golurk.gif" alt="Golurk" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Golurk"><strong>Golurk</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 89 HP / 124 Atk / 80 Def / 55 SpA / 80 Def / 55 Spe<br />
Abilities: Iron Fist / Klutz / No Guard</p>

<p>Golurk benefited plenty from BW2, gaining Stealth Rock and the elemental punches, while also benefiting from the rise of Fighting-types. Golurk's unique Ground / Ghost typing and decent bulk allows it to handle Heracross and Mienshao as well as check Electric-types, while also putting offensive pressure on the opponent with its high 124 Attack. These positive traits allow Golurk to be a valuable team supporter.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/hitmontop.gif" alt="Hitmontop" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/hitmontop"><strong>Hitmontop</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 95 Atk / 95 Def / 35 SpA / 110 SpD / 70 Spe<br />
Abilities: Intimidate / Technician / Steadfast</p>

<p>Hitmontop has access to the vaunted Rapid Spin that gives it a decent niche in UU. Thanks to Intimidate and overall decent defenses, Hitmontop does have a good amount of switch in opportunities to spin away hazards. While Hitmontop struggles against the majority of Ghost-types in the tier, if it can catch them on the switch with Foresight, it can manage to get a spin off. Hitmontop is a viable choice if you desperately need a spinner and if Blastoise, the better spinner of the two, has conflicting type synergy with your other Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/mew.gif" alt="Mew" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Mew"><strong>Mew</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:100 HP / 100 Atk / 100 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Ability: Synchronize</p>

<p>With access to every TM and move tutor ever, Mew has an insanely large movepool that makes it among the most versatile Pokemon in the game, being able to assume any position. Mew's best set is a Nasty Plot sweeper that uses Mew's decent 100 Special Attack to be raised to destructive levels, while using its amazing coverage to wreck certain targets that could annoy its main Psychic attacks. Mew also performs the role of a Swords Dance sweeper very well, and while some may think it is outclassed by more powerful physical sweepers like Darmanitan, Mew's much better bulk compared to other physical attackers and excellent coverage makes it ridiculously good. Mew also performs the role of a defensive Pokemon as well, being a specially defensive stallbreaker that is capable of putting a damper on stall with access to Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Softboiled, as well as having nice utility against offensive and balanced teams, being able to beat a plethora of strong special attackers by tanking any hit and recovering lost damage. Another set that Mew uses well is a Baton Pass set that is capable of aiding many offensive Pokemon to become even more threatening. Overall, Mew's excellent versatility makes it a Pokemon that is a great pick for any team.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/milotic.gif" alt="Milotic" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/milotic"><strong>Milotic</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 60 Atk / 79 Def / 100 SpA / 125 SpD / 81 Spe<br />
Abilities: Marvel Scale / Cute Charm</p>

<p>BW2 UU has been the toughest metagame for Milotic to succeed in, as other bulky Water-types fill the tier with their own unique niche that leaves Milotic outclassed in many aspects. Blastoise has access to Rapid Spin, Empoleon and Swampert have unique typings, Slowbro and Slowking have Regenerator and a Fighting resistance, and Suicune is in general just much bulkier than Milotic. Milotic still has a niche, though, and that is given through its fantastic Special Defense. Its typing has advantages over the other specially bulky Water-type Slowking, granting it a neutrality to Heracross's Megahorn and Yanmega's Bug Buzz. If someone needs a decent answer to some of the tier's biggest threats, Milotic can perform that role, but if someone desires a hard counter, Milotic will not be able to perform that role as well as something else.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/porygon2.gif" alt="Porygon2" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Porygon2/ou"><strong>Porygon2</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 85 HP / 80 Atk / 90 Def / 105 SpA / 95 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Abilities: Trace / Download / Analytic</p>

<p>Thanks to Eviolite, Porygon2 is among the bulkiest of UU Pokemon. While it may initially seem that Porygon2 needs to be a wall, Porygon2 performs best as a bulky attacker that is capable of dealing out good damage with its base 105 Special Attack. A Download or Analytic boost further makes Porygon2 threatening towards opponents, as it will hit relatively hard with a boost in hand. But if you want Porygon2 to be a more dedicated wall, it can perform that role excellently with its fantastic 85 / 90 / 95 bulk that is made immense with Eviolite while being able to recover any damage with Recover. Trace is particularly useful when using defensive Porygon2, as it can copy abilities that can benefit it like Natural Cure from Roserade, making it a fantastic utility counter.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/qwilfish.gif" alt="Qwilfish" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/qwilfish"><strong>Qwilfish</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 95 Atk / 75 Def / 55 SpA / 55 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Poison Point / Swift Swim / Intimidate</p>

<p>Qwilfish's Dream World ability, Intimidate, has made Qwilfish a nuisance to take down on the physical side thanks to its increased defenses. Thanks to its unique typing, Qwilfish is capable of walling Fighting-, Bug-, and physical Fire-types that commonly roam the tier. Qwilfish was blessed with a great support movepool which includes the valuable Spikes, Thunder Wave, Toxic Spikes, Haze, and Taunt. Spikes support is especially useful, considering that the only other defensive Spiker of the tier is Roserade, which can't take on the same threats Qwilfish does. Qwilfish can also perform as a decent suicide lead, as it is decently fast and has access to Explosion and Destiny Bond, moves other suicide leads lack.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/registeel.gif" alt="Registeel" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/registeel"><strong>Registeel</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 80 HP / 75 Atk / 150 Def / 75 SpA / 150 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Ability: Clear Body</p>

<p>Registeel's fantastic 11 resistances thanks to its pure Steel typing makes it a solid defensive Pokemon capable of countering Raikou, Roserade, and Yanmega. Registeel also has great support options, such as Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave, which can aid a team immensely. It suffers in this metagame, though, due to its common weaknesses to Ground, Fighting, and Fire, all of which are very prevalent. Registeel also lacks reliable recovery, which attributes to its often being taken down quickly. It also has low offensive prowess, making it rely on Seismic Toss to do any significant damage, which can actually compound to it being set-up fodder for something like Calm Mind Suicune or offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus if it lacks Toxic. To top it off, Registeel also faces competition with other common Steel-types which have their own niches, such as Bronzong and Empoleon.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/sableye.gif" alt="Sableye" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Sableye/ou"><strong>Sableye</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 75 Atk / 75 Def / 65 SpA / 65 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Abilities: Keen Eye / Stall / Prankster</p>

<p>Thanks to Prankster, Sableye is a very capable Pokemon in UU, with priority Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Recover. Combine that with its no weaknesses, and Sableye becomes an annoying Pokemon for physical attackers, set-up sweepers, and hazard setters to face when in the right hands. Sableye only got better as the metagame transitioned to BW2, being able to easily deal with common Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Scrafty, as well as not be as threatened by Heracross, which often has Moxie over Guts on its popular Choice Scarf set, allowing Sableye to easily burn it and cripple instead of benefiting it with a Guts boost. Sableye can even use Foul Play to annoy physical Fire-types that can switch into Will-O-Wisp, such as Darmanitan and Victini, and easily KO them.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/slowbro.gif" alt="Slowbro" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Slowbro/ou"><strong>Slowbro</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 75 Atk / 110 Def / 100 SpA / 80 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Abilities: Oblivious / Own Tempo / Regenerator</p>

<p>Slowbro's high physical defense and ability to wall the majority of Fighting-types, physical Fire-types, and other physical attackers make it an excellent bulky Water-type. Slowbro has access to Slack Off and Regenerator, two great ways to regain health that makes it one tough Pokemon to wither down. Thanks to all of these positive traits, Slowbro performs the role of a bulky Calm Mind attacker that can patch up its weaker Special Defense and make it a substantial threat after a few boosts. Slowbro also performs being a pure defensive Water-type very well, capable of paralyzing the opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave. Another way Slowbro can function is through the use of Choice Specs, which increases Slowbro's offensive prowess significantly and allows it to dent something relatively hard, while still retaining much of the excellent physical bulk the defensive sets have.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/slowking.gif" alt="Slowking" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Slowking/ou"><strong>Slowking</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 75 Atk / 80 Def / 100 SpA / 110 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Abilities: Oblivious / Own Tempo / Regenerator</p>

<p>While Slowking may lack the physical defense that its counterpart Slowbro has, it makes up in having great Special Defense which allows it to effectively take on one of the biggest threats in the metagame in Kingdra. With minimal Attack investment, Slowking is capable of breaking Kingdra's Substitutes with a Dragon Tail, while being able to tank a +1 Outrage and check Kingdra thanks to Regenerator. Kingdra's special attacking sets, which can easily plow through Slowbro, fare much worse against Slowking, who can easily stomach a Draco Meteor and Slack Off the damage. While Slowking may have significantly lower physical defense than Slowbro, the same typing still allows it to combat some highly relevant threats such as physical Fire- and Fighting-types. Slowking's fantastic niche as a Kingdra counter cannot be ignored, as it is a defining factor that makes Slowking a great choice for teams needing to patch up a Kingdra weakness.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/suicune.gif" alt="Suicune" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Suicune"><strong>Suicune</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 75 Atk / 115 Def / 90 SpA / 115 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Ability: Pressure</p>

<p>Suicune's high overall bulk, pure Water typing, and access to Calm Mind make it a great bulky sweeper. Thanks to that high bulk, Suicune can set up Calm Minds on many Pokemon, while it can Roar away opposing Pokemon that try to take advantage of Suicune's initial low offensive prowess. Suicune also can use its classic CroCune set, which forgoes Roar in favor of Sleep Talk so that Suicune is not deadweight when asleep, while still using that terrific bulk to its advantage. If you want a harder hitting Suicune, though, it can perform the role of an offensive Calm Mind set well, hitting relatively hard with Hydro Pumps while still having decent bulk to boot.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/swampert.gif" alt="Swampert" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Swampert"><strong>Swampert</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 110 Atk / 90 Def / 85 SpA / 90 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Abilities: Torrent / Damp</p>

<p>Swampert truly thrives in UU nowadays, thanks to its great Water / Ground typing that allows it to combat Raikou and Zapdos as well as physical Fire-types without too much trouble. Swampert's well rounded bulk, ability to handle extremely threatening Pokemon without much issue, and access to some great support moves such as Stealth Rock and Roar allows it to perform the role of a defensive tank very well. Swampert's often-overlooked base 110 Attack can shine in the correct times when utilizing Choice Band and offensive tank variants of Swampert. Swampert is definitely a top-tier defensive Pokemon that is capable of fitting on any team because of its unique traits.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/tangrowth.gif" alt="Tangrowth" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/tangrowth"><strong>Tangrowth</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 100 Atk / 125 Def / 110 SpA / 50 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Abilities: Chlorophyll / Leaf Guard / Regenerator</p>

<p>While Tangrowth receives massive competition from Amoonguss as a bulky Grass-type, its fantastic physical bulk and good Special Attack allows it to perform as a strong Choice Specs attacker that can pivot into certain physical attackers and hit brutally hard with a Choice Specs-boosted Leaf Storm or incapacitate its counters with a Sleep Powder. With an amazing ability in Regenerator, Tangrowth also has great lasting power.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/umbreon.gif" alt="Umbreon" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/umbreon"><strong>Umbreon</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 65 Atk / 110 Def / 60 SpA / 130 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Abilities: Synchronize / Inner Focus</p>

<p>Umbreon is the best dedicated special wall in the tier, with its high special bulk and great support movepool that includes Wish and Heal Bell. Wish and cleric support are rare things to come by in the tier, and Umbreon is among the best to provide that support. What makes Umbreon really great, though, is its access to Foul Play, which makes up for Umbreon's lack of offensive prowess. Foul Play dents the majority of the tier a great deal, while able to do surprising damage to frailer Fighting-types like Mienshao. If you need cleric and Wish support, or just in general a great special wall, Umbreon is a fantastic option for your team.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/uxie.gif" alt="Uxie" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/uxie"><strong>Uxie</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 75 Atk / 130 Def / 75 SpA / 130 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Uxie is often shunned in favor of Mew and Cresselia when competing as a defensive Psychic-type. Uxie does have some tricks up its sleeves, though. With access to great support moves such as dual screens, Stealth Rock, Memento, Thunder Wave, Rain Dance, Sunny Day, and Trick Room, Uxie can effortlessly support your team well. Uxie's great 75 / 130 / 130 bulk along with a great Fighting resistance opens up plenty of opportunities to use one of its support move options.</p>

<p><img src="/dex/media/sprites/bw/178.gif" alt="Xatu" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Xatu/ou"><strong>Xatu</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 75 Atk / 70 Def / 95 SpA / 70 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Synchronize / Early Bird / Magic Bounce</p>

<p>Xatu's Dream World ability, Magic Bounce, allows it to bounce back any non-attacking move, but most importantly, entry hazards. Xatu can also keep momentum for any offensive team with access to U-turn, while supplying some utility with access to moves like Thunder Wave. If Xatu is on the wrong end of the battle against a Stealth Rock setter, it can Roost any lost damage if it's not KOed yet. Xatu will only truly shine if you don't want to run a Rapid Spin user while maintaining a good amount of momentum for offensive teams.</p>
