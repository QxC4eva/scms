<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Ice-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed during the damage calculation. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Ice-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In OU, Yache Berry can allow Gliscor an extra turn to get a useful Speed or Attack boost. Yache Berry's claim to fame came in early DP where it consistently allowed Garchomp to set up a Swords Dance, even while being hit by 4x super effective Ice-type attacks. Thanks to the Yache Berry, these Pokemon can raise their own stats consistently which allows them to be much larger threats to opposing teams.</p>
