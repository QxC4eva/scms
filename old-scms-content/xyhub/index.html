            <h3>Blaziken and Deoxys-N Quick-Banned from XY and PokéBank OU.</h3>
                <h4>Posted by Jukain on <strong>November 13, 2013</strong></h4>
                    <p>The OU council has concluded that Blaziken and Deoxys-N, two Pokémon allowed initially in XY, will be quick-banned from both current XY OU and PokéBank OU. This means that there will be no public vote; the council has simply decided that this is necessary. Both have been preeminent threats since XY's inception, and are detrimental to the balance of the tier. Blaziken is simply a monster sweeper. Its power is unparalleled, being virtually impossible to counter or even check if the player lacks a Talonflame or Azumarill on his or her offensive team. Defensive teams can opt for Slowbro, defensive Gyrados, or in PokéBank Jellicent, but these Pokemon just are not cut out for any other team in this metagame. With the addition of Baton Pass to its movepool and thus the ability to passed the boost it gains from Swords Dance and Speed Boost, it can pass to a teammate that could handle it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Deoxys-N is also way too powerful for OU to handle. Its dual 150 offenses in addition to Speed give it plenty of power to work with, and a devastating STAB Psycho Boost as well as a list of coverage moves that goes on for days make it virtually impossible to handle with any Pokemon&mdash;conventional or not. Deoxys-N was so obviously broken that there were some people who did not even realize it had been excluded from the initial banlist in the first place. It was not a Pokemon OU could adequately deal with in any way. Therefore, it was banned.</p>
                    
                    <p>Actual suspect tests will likely not begin until PokéBank OU is released, so these will probably be the last bans until that time. Stay tuned for the latest XY!</p>
