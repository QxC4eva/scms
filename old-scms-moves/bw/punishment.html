Does more damage to targets with stat boosts.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The Base Power of this move increases depending on the number of stat boosts accumulated by the target, as per the following calculation:</p>

<p>Base Power = 60 + (20 * Total Number of Stat Rises)</p>

<p>For instance, if the target had 1 Swords Dance boost and 2 Calm Mind boosts, then this would be +2 Attack, +2 Special Attack, and +2 Special Defense, so Punishment's power on it would be 60 + (20 * 6) = 180. This move's maximum power is 200. Also, stat drops do not affect the Base Power.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Punishment is an interesting move because it can serve as an immediate stop to users of setup moves, in particular Calm Mind. Choice Scarf Ho-oh is the main user of this move in Ubers, while Choice Scarf Primeape does a similar job in RU. Regardless, the minimum 60 base power is not too bad, either, since it helps Primeape in particular against Ghost-types like Cofagrigus and Rotom.</p>
