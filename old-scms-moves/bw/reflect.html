Lowers damage from physical attacks to the user's team for 5 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For 5 turns, the user and its party members take 0.5x damage from physical attacks, or 0.66x damage if in a double or triple battle. This is not treated as a stat change. Critical hits ignore this protection. It is removed from the user's side if the user or an ally is successfully hit by Brick Break or Defog. Brick Break removes the effect before damage is calculated. Brick Break will not cancel the effect if it fails to hit the target, or if it is used on a Ghost-type. Lasts for 8 turns if the user is holding Light Clay.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Reflect is an excellent move that gives your entire team extra protection from physical moves. Halving damage is quite a potent effect, and can protect frail sweepers from KOs, and give them a window to set up. It is often paired with Light Screen to form the dual screens strategy, which involves a bulky Pokemon setting up both screens, which are then passed to a sweeper (commonly by switching, sometimes by other methods, such as U-turn and Explosion). Light Clay is a useful hold item that extends the duration of Reflect to 8 turns, and rarely will the strategy of dual screens be used without it.</p>
