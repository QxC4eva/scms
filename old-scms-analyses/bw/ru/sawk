[Overview]

<p>Sawk is one among a plethora of Fighting-types introduced in BW. Though it didn't find its way into the OU tier like many of its Fighting-type counterparts, it immediately became a force to be reckoned with in the lower tiers. Boasting an excellent base 125 Attack stat and a favorable base 85 Speed, Sawk is quite the offensive menace. It finds its primary niche in the RU tier as a Choice Band and Choice Scarf user, and one of the better ones at that. Sawk is able to easily penetrate the opponent's defenses by unleashing its powerful Choice Band-boosted Close Combat on the opponent. While Sawk can dish out hits, it isn't very good at taking them, as 75 / 75 / 75 defenses aren't great. Fortunately, Sawk was gifted with the ability of Sturdy to fall back on, which works as a makeshift Focus Sash.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sawk is among the top users of both the Choice Band and the Choice Scarf. With a Choice Scarf, a Jolly nature and maximum Speed EVs, Sawk hits a Speed stat of 442, outspeeding every unboosted Pokemon in RU that isn't holding a Scarf itself. When equipped with a Choice Band, along with an Adamant nature and maximum Attack EVs, Sawk's Attack stat goes through the roof, allowing it to tear through even the most sturdy of walls. Sawk's outstanding coverage with Close Combat and the EdgeQuake combo makes it a great user of Choice items, allowing it to hit most of the Pokemon in RU super effectively. Close Combat is the premier move of this set and can easily rip through opposing teams, while Toxic can put one of Sawk's switch-ins on a timer, helping Sawk to break through a team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Sawk can run Reversal to deal an impressive amount of damage if Sturdy has been activated and Sawk is at 1 HP, but this is extremely situational and often hard to pull off with a Choice item. When it comes to teammates for Sawk, it's best to pair it with Pokemon that can both lay and spin away entry hazards. Sawk works nicely with Rapid Spin support because it isn't very bulky and often has to switch in and out due to being locked into one move; in addition to this, Sturdy can stay intact if Sawk isn't damaged by entry hazards. Entry hazard support assists Sawk in scoring some extra 2HKOs or OHKOs. Inner Focus can be used if you want to remove any chance of Sawk being flinched, but Sturdy is usually the superior choice; it allows Sawk to survive hits it otherwise wouldn't and can be the difference between a win or a loss.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sawk doesn't have a whole lot of other options to abuse, but it can run 2 sets that could be considered viable. The first of these sets uses a Life Orb and 3 attacks, consisting of Close Combat, Stone Edge, and Earthquake, with Toxic as a support move. Sawk can also potentially run a Bulk Up set with Bulk Up and the 3 attacks mentioned in its other sets, although it isn't a great abuser of Bulk Up, as it starts out somewhat frail and isn't amazingly bulky at +1 either. In addition to this, Throh is far superior at using Bulk Up.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>While Sawk is a powerhouse, it has no shortage of counters. Uxie as a Psychic-type with good defenses can tank all of Sawk's attacks and retaliate with a STAB Psychic attack. Ghost-types with good physical defense and access to Will-O-Wisp, such as Spiritomb and Misdreavus are also great counters to Sawk, being able to tank one of Sawk's attacks before burning it. Sawk is also helpless against Pokemon with great physical bulk such as Tangrowth which can tank Sawk's attacks and heal off the damage it took via Regenerator.</p>
