[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder gains 25% of its maximum HP when hit by an Electric-type attack and negates the attack. A Ground-type Pokemon with Volt Absorb will not heal any HP. Redirection effects (such as <a href="/bw/abilities/lightningrod">Lightningrod</a>) take effect before Volt Absorb activates. Volt Absorb activates through <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a> but not <a href="/bw/moves/protect">Protect</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Due to <a href="/bw/pokemon/thundurus-t">Thundurus-T</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/politoed">Politoed</a>'s <a href="/bw/abilities/drizzle">Drizzle</a>, and Electric-type attacks being very strong in general this generation, Volt Absorb has a great use in being able to cover up an Electric-type weakness easily. Thundurus-T, <a href="/bw/pokemon/jolteon">Jolteon</a>, and <a href="/bw/pokemon/lanturn">Lanturn</a> can switch into most Electric-type Pokemon for free healing, though they should beware of coverage moves.</p>
