[Overview]

<p>Glaceon is one of the dominant forces of hail in RU, with a Blizzard so enormously powerful that it 2HKOes everything that doesn't resist it&mdash;and that's assuming there are no entry hazards. It's surprisingly bulky, too&mdash;short of hitting it super effectively, not many attackers are able to OHKO Glaceon before it wipes them out. Glaceon can even use hail to stall with a SubProtect set, one of the most annoying sets that hail teams have to offer.</p>

<p>However, Glaceon certainly isn't without its flaws. Its base 65 Speed is quite low, and it has no way of boosting it. Its Ice typing is a double-edged sword, giving it nasty weaknesses that compromise its otherwise great bulk. Its movepool is very small, making it rather predictable once you know which set it's running. Finally, it requires Snover as a teammate to provide the hail that makes it viable. If you can get around these flaws, though, Glaceon will rarely disappoint you.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Given that Glaceon has the highest Special Attack of any Pokemon legal in RU play, it is no surprise that it can run a viable Choice Specs set. Blizzard is the key to this set; with STAB, Choice Specs, and hail backing it up, it becomes a perfectly accurate powerhouse of a move. Even many Pokemon that resist the move need be careful; for example, Crawdaunt is always OHKOed by Blizzard even without any entry hazards after factoring in hail damage. Being generally bulky isn't enough to save Glaceon's hapless victims either, as even max HP Spiritomb is effortlessly OHKOed, again with only hail damage for support. Whenever your opponents lack a healthy team member that has both special bulk and an Ice resistance, simply select Blizzard; it is almost certain they'll be losing a Pokemon.</p>

<p>Shadow Ball is used entirely for Slowking, but is still the most viable coverage move in Glaceon's shallow movepool. Ground is the preferred Hidden Power type, beating Pokemon that can take a Blizzard after Stealth Rock and hail damage such as Emboar, Lanturn, and Kabutops. Hidden Power Fire is a viable alternative, as it is Glaceon's best weapon against Steel-types that aren't weak to Ground as well as opposing Ice-types, most notably Escavalier, Cryogonal, and Rotom-F, all of which can beat Glaceon otherwise. However, Glaceon with Hidden Power Fire has no means of beating Lanturn. The final move is mostly a filler, but each option does have a few niche uses. Frost Breath is used for beating defensive boosters, such as Cosmic Power Sigilyph and Calm Mind Clefable, even after they've set up; it also gives Glaceon a backup STAB in case Blizzard runs out of PP. Baton Pass seems strange on a Choice set, but can be used if you suspect your opponent will switch so that you keep up your momentum.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on this set are fairly self-explanatory; the extra point in HP gives Glaceon an ideal Ice Body number while also granting it an extra switch into Stealth Rock if it takes no other damage, while max Speed allows for a Speed tie with Adamant Emboar. However, this assumes you are running Hidden Power Ground, which does not reduce Glaceon's Speed. If you are using Fire as your Hidden Power type, it is recommended to run a spread of 72 HP / 252 SpA / 184 Spe to account for the 30 Speed IV; this maintains the same effect with Glaceon's HP while allowing it to outspeed standard Qwilfish and standard bulky Gallade by one point, as well as Adamant Crawdaunt and Bouffalant. A Timid nature is an option, but using it requires giving up a lot of power and only allows Glaceon to gain ground on three relevant threats: Emboar, and Absol, the former of which Glaceon only manages to Speed tie with if Emboar is running a Jolly Nature, and only with Hidden Power Ground. Glaceon rarely needs the ability to switch moves as Blizzard is so powerful, but if you really hate the idea of being locked into one move, Icicle Plate is a possible alternative to bluff Choice Specs and surprise switch-ins, though the loss in power is rarely worth it. Life Orb is another option; you lose the ability to bluff Choice Specs, but can still throw opponents off-guard when they switch Slowking or Lanturn into Blizzard, as they then have to decide to predict the incoming Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Ground, Glaceon switching out, or another possible Blizzard if they decide to switch out.</p>

<p>Besides the obvious Snover, there are several teammates that can really improve Glaceon's performance. Glaceon really appreciates having support from entry hazards, as they greatly improve its ability to KO things and work very well with its ability to force switches. Uxie is one of the best choices for this, as it not only offers Stealth Rock support, but also spreads paralysis, a condition extremely beneficial to the otherwise slow Glaceon. It also offers support in the form of Heal Bell and resists Glaceon's Fighting-type weakness. Another excellent teammate is Kabutops, as on top of its 4x resistance to Fire, it can spin away the Stealth Rock that otherwise reduces Glaceon's longevity. Cryogonal is an alternative for Rapid Spin support that deals with special attackers better and has no fear of hail, but note that it compounds Glaceon's weaknesses as it shares the same typing.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Blizzard
move 2: Hidden Power Ground

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Glaceon is not nearly as powerful as it would be when holding Choice Specs, a STAB Blizzard from this set is still nothing that should be underestimated, as it even 2HKOes Entei after Stealth Rock damage. Choice Scarf Glaceon is as fast as Choice Scarf Emboar and physically bulkier and more powerful than Rotom-F, while also possessing a useful ability in Ice Body allowing it to survive for a longer period of time. Hidden Power Ground is the most useful Hidden Power in general for Glaceon, hitting Lanturn, Kabutops, and Fire-types, while Shadow Ball hits Slowking super effectively and has good neutral coverage on Pokemon such as Poliwrath. Shadow Ball is especially useful for not becoming locked into Blizzard if the opponent has an Ice-type resist such as Slowking, and conserving Blizzard's PP. A STAB Blizzard is actually stronger versus Pokemon such as Poliwrath, though. The last moveslot depends on preference. Frost Breath is great for beating Pokemon with Special Defense boosts that may be a threat to hail teams such as Uxie, Spiritomb, and Sigilyph. Baton Pass can be used as a pseudo U-turn to scout the opponent, though Glaceon will usually be firing off powerful Blizzards during its time on the field. With a Choice Scarf, Glaceon becomes a very effective late-game sweeper.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As always, near max Special Attack is used to hit as hard as possible and 8 HP EVs let Glaceon make the most of Ice Body. A Timid nature with max Speed is used in order to Speed tie with Choice Scarf Emboar and to outspeed Sceptile and everything slower. For moves, Hidden Power Fire can be used instead of Hidden Power Ground in order to hit Escavalier and Cryogonal. Sleep Talk is another option in the last slot, as Glaceon can take a sleep move from something like Amoonguss, which it matches up well against. Glaceon should obviously be paired with Snover, as well as Pokemon that can deal with Steel- and Fire-types, such as Poliwrath. Entry hazard support is greatly appreciated so that Glaceon's counters, such as Escavalier and Emboar, will be worn down, allowing it to get more KOs on weakened foes late in the game. It can also be used in tandem with another powerful Blizzard user, such as Jynx or Rotom-F, to put pressure on the opponent should they lack Ice-type resists. Rapid Spin support from Cryogonal or Kabutops is also appreciated, as Glaceon has a much easier time switching in without Stealth Rock on the field. Other good teammates include wallbreakers such as Gallade, Druddigon, and Durant, which will all help Glaceon sweep late-game.</p> 

[SET]
name: SubProtect
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Protect
move 3: Blizzard
move 4: Hidden Power Ground / Toxic
item: Leftovers
ability: Ice Body
nature: Modest
evs: 208 HP / 44 Def / 252 SpA / 4 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While the Choice Specs set aims to outright destroy the opposition, this set takes a more subtle and prolonged approach. The threat of Glaceon's enormously powerful Blizzards forces a lot of switches, which this set uses to set up a Substitute and, from there, takes advantage of the combined recovery from Leftovers and Ice Body, which needs only one turn after using Substitute to fully pay its cost. Because this turn is very easily bought with Protect, Glaceon can comfortably stall for 32 turns straight while the opponent can do very little about it, and with Toxic Spikes and other entry hazard support, Glaceon can easily stall an entire team to death.</p>

<p>While Walrein can do the same thing with more bulk and a generally better typing, Glaceon can use its powerful Special Attack stat and Blizzard to take the set in a more offensive direction. Though not as powerful without Choice Specs, Glaceon still has plenty of power, enough to easily beat common users of Taunt that would wreck Walrein. Taunt users such as Drapion and Qwilfish are easily 2HKOed by Blizzard despite the latter's Ice resistance, not to mention that other common grounded Poison-types, such as Roselia and Amoonguss, are effortlessly OHKOed. In the fourth slot, Hidden Power Ground deals with Lanturn and Steel-types very well, while Toxic prevents Cryogonal and Rotom-F from walling this set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The HP EVs ensure that recovery from both Leftovers and Ice Body is exactly enough to pay the cost of Substitute, allowing Glaceon to stall until it runs out of PP. 4 Speed is enough to beat minimum Speed Sandslash and Roselia, max Special Attack is used to power up Blizzard, and the remaining EVs are placed into Defense, which ensures that Choice Band Cinccino needs two hits with Rock Blast to break a Substitute and also makes it harder for defensive Pokemon such as Qwilfish to break a Substitute. Alternatively, an EV spread of 8 HP / 248 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature is very viable for this set, as it makes this Glaceon better at bluffing the Choice Specs set, ensures it can beat Absol. It should be noted that Vanilluxe can also use this set, being faster but less powerful, and so should be considered over Glaceon if you want your Glaceon to take this route.</p>

<p>Snover is a required teammate for this set, because without Ice Body being able to activate, this set has no way at all of being successful. This Glaceon also benefits enormously from Toxic Spikes support, as well as other entry hazards. Qwilfish therefore makes for a great partner, as not only does it resist three of Glaceon's four weaknesses, but it sets Toxic Spikes, has the option of setting Spikes as well, and removes the opponent's Toxic Spikes upon entry. Cryogonal also works well as a partner, removing all entry hazards and helping to stop special attackers; if you don't like the idea of compounding Glaceon's weaknesses, Kabutops can be used instead. Finally, Walrein can partner well with this set; while using two of the same set might be counterintuitive, the subtle differences in how they play can prove very significant, and having twice the PP for Substitute and Protect makes the two even harder to break.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Given Glaceon's shallow movepool, it doesn't have too many other options. Wish and Heal Bell are interesting team support options, but SubProtect has four-moveslot syndrome as it is, whereas Choice Specs would need to switch out after using these moves. Fake Tears can see some use on an Icicle Plate variant of the Choice Specs set to force switches, beat defensive teams easier, and make up for the lack of Choice Specs's power, but this requires a lot of prediction to use well. Roar is an option for the SubProtect set, but this is generally better done by Walrein.</p>

<p>It should be noted that because Snow Cloak is banned, Glaceon cannot use any of its moves that are illegal with Ice Body. This isn't really a big loss, as the only even remotely viable move lost in this way is Water Pulse, and Snow Cloak is inferior to Ice Body even on the Choice Specs set, as it prevents bluffing the possibility of the SubProtect set. Also of note is that a super effective Water Pulse would be weaker than a neutral Blizzard; for similar reasons, Signal Beam is not recommended despite its legality.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>In general, the best way to deal with the Choice Specs set is revenge killing it; unless you have one of the few Pokemon that can switch into it safely, it's easier to simply take advantage of its low Speed to at least force it out. Do note, though, that Glaceon can be surprisingly bulky, and rarely has qualms about taking advantage of a hit that isn't strong enough to KO the would-be revenge killer. Dealing with the SubProtect set can be trickier; phazing it or Encoring it are your best bets. While Taunt can work with some prediction, Glaceon is fairly likely to just use Blizzard the turn you use the move. If you have a weather move other than Hail, using it can swiftly neuter Glaceon regardless of the set and usually much of its team as well, though make sure to KO Snover first.</p>

<p>If you want something that can beat Glaceon regardless of the set, there are a few viable options. Specially defensive Hariyama with Thick Fat isn't 2HKOed by Choice Specs Blizzard and can either hit Glaceon super effectively or phaze it away with Whirlwind. Poliwrath and Regice also avoid the 2HKO and, with Rest, have no fear of Toxic Spikes or Toxic itself from the SubProtect set. Escavalier can also work well if it has Overcoat, though note that it needs significant investment in Special Defense to not be 2HKOed by Choice Specs Blizzard and it also must be careful of Hidden Power Fire. Rotom-F also fears Hidden Power Fire, but takes little damage from Glaceon's other moves and can scout with Volt Switch. Cryogonal can take a Blizzard and Recover off the damage, though it can do little to threaten Glaceon in return and will usually lose to Choice Specs Glaceon with Hidden Power Fire or SubProtect Glaceon with Toxic. Slowking can comfortably take a Blizzard, but needs to watch out for Choice Specs Shadow Ball and Toxic. Lanturn can use Heal Bell to rid itself from Toxic, but needs to watch for Hidden Power Ground. If all else fails, Munchlax is a nearly perfect counter, but considering how little utility it has elsewhere, don't use it unless you're really desperate for an answer to Glaceon.</p>
