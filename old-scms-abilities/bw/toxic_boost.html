<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is poisoned or badly poisoned, its Attack is increased by 50%.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>An increase to Attack as supposed to a straight immunity is a nice boost for <a href="/bw/pokemon/zangoose">Zangoose</a>. While it must now lose HP in between turns, when coupled with <a href="/bw/moves/swords_dance">Swords Dance</a> and <a href="/bw/items/toxic_orb">Toxic Orb</a>, Zangoose becomes a ferocious attacker, and one of the most powerful threats in NU, only kept in check by its general frailty.</p>
