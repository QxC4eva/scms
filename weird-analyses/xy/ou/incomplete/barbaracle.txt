 Overview
########


Barbaracle is one of the fastest and strongest users of the infamous set up move Shell Smash making it one of the most threatening 1 turn set ups in the OU tier. With usable bulk, and a respectable set of resistances Barbaracle can find opportunities to set up, and when it does, it punches holes in teams, or finishes them off entirely. Offensively, Barbaracle is quite good, with a dual STAB that grants useful super effective coverage, and a number of coverage moves that make it hard to wall, and just enough speed and attack to make shell smash work. Although after 1 turn set up it may not be the strongest or fastest, nothing but other smashers can rival its combination of power, speed and coverage all in one. Despite a fine set of merits, Barbaracle of course has shortcomings. It simply does not have the pure power to muscle through the bulkiest Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, and Skarmory. On top of this, despite being able to outpace notable choice scarf users at +2 speed, 68 base speed causes it fall just short of based 108 speed scarf users and beyond. Priority based revenge killers are not fun for Barbaracle too, and although few can cleanly OHKO it, often teams will have more than one and manage to take it down. Finally, Barbaracle doesnt have much else up its sleeve other than Shell Smash so it is very predictable.

Moves
========

Shell Smash boosts Barbaracle's Speed, and Attack to very high levels in one turn, allowing you to make severe dents in opposing teams, or even sweeping them completely. Razor Shell is Barbaracle's primary STAB move being far more accurate than stone edge, and just on par for power thanks to tough claws. Stone Edge is Barbaracle's secondary STAB that allows it to cut anything weak to it to ribbons, and offers the strongest attack against a number of Water-type resists that take neutral damage from Rock attacks, such as Rotom-W. Barbaracle's STAB are obligatory as not only are they your strongest attacks, but they grant important super effective coverage hitting some key physically defensive pokemon like Landorus-therian, and Mandibuzz. Earthquake is Barbaracle's best bet at muscling past Aegislash, as at +2 it cleanly OHKOs min defense variants and has a good chance at defeating max HP variants in one hit after stealth rock damage. Earthquake also offers 100% accuracy, and good coverage in general, hitting Pokemon such as Jirachi very hard. Cross chop allows Barbaracle to OHKO, or deal massive damage to Pokemon such as Chansey, and Ferrothorn who otherwise can comfortably take a hit from Barbaracle, and in return OHKO it or cripple it. Gastrodon can be defeated with Cross Chop as it will 2HKO it, while Earthquake will not, however a white herb must be used to accomplish this, as with -1 SpD, Gastrodon's Earth Power will KO. Cross chop is fantastically stronger than Earthquake thanks to tough claws too.


Set Details
========

The EVs for Barbaracle's Shell Smash set are simple, and optimal. 232 speed EVs with Jolly nature just outpaces Deoxy-S when at +2, as well as scarf users base 102 speed and under. Max attack maximizes Barbaracle's power and it needs every ounce of strength it can get. Due to lack of priority that Barbaracle has, and the defense dropping nature of Shell Smash it usually can not afford to run a Life Orb if it plans to sweep, thus more conservative options that can improve survivability are favorable. White Herb is an invaluable item to Barbaracle, as it allows Barbaracle to retain its solid physical bulk meaning it is more resistant to priority. White Herb also restores the stat drop of Sticky Web, thus in a sticky web Barbaracle can still sweep after setup against fast Scarfers. Lum Berry allows Barbaracle to set up in the face of status users, this is important, as the more set up opportunities it has, the better. Lum Berry also protects against Prankster status users, such as Thundurus, Mega Banette, Sableye, and Klefki, all of which would stop a sweep for not the Lum. Both are excellent choices that depend on opposing team match up. Mystic Water is also a considerable option as Razor Shell is the most often used move and the power increase helps beat a couple checks like Garchomp soundly. Finally, Life Orb may be considered on Barbaracle as the power boost is immense, letting Barbaracle act as a bit more of a Wall Breaker, as the recoil is often too much to sweep in the face of any priority or sustained damage on set up.


Usage Tips
========

What must be understood about Barbaracle is that although it is fast, and strong after one turn it can not cleanly OHKO everything. Just plain bulky pokemon with resists to Barbaracle's best moves in some cases, such as Celebi, Garchomp and Keldeo easily avoid an OHKO at full strength and retaliate with an OHKO. Because of this is very advisable to leave Barbaracle for later in the game. Barbaracle is fantastic at tanking Extremespeeds, and priority Brave Bird, as well as not falling to weaker neutral priority. However, fighting priority and the strongest neutral priorities moves such as Scizor's bullet punch, and Bisharp's Sucker Punch can do sizable damage, thus, attempting to sweep without account for these moves by attempting to preserve's Barbaracle's HP during set up, or trapping and killing these priority users is ill advised. As for set up opportunities taking advantage of typical choiced attacks such as Genesect's Flamethrower, Talonflame's Brave Bird though white herb is required for Talonflame, and any weaker choiced resist can be very easily exploited. In general, identify the bulky pokemon that need to be worn down, identify the priority or scarf users that offensively check Barbaracle, and wait until they are sufficiently weakened before setting up.

Team Options
========

Like any sweeper Barbaracle loves hazard support, and lots of it. Due to Stone Edge's ability demolish countless Flying-types, and razor shell being to able to eviscerate these same types with stealth rock neutralities such as Gliscor and Landorus, spike stacking allows Barbaracle to breeze through typical checks. Dual screening, and suicidal taunt users can give Barbaracle many more chances to set up, turning the tide of the game very quickly. Deoxys-Speed excels at all of these roles, and makes a good partner to Barbaracle. Gardevoir is capable of a Memento + Dual Screen set which ensure set up against even very strong opponents. Pokemon that are able to defeat the hardest stops to Barbaracle are ideal partners, strong wall breakers such as Mega Medicham, and Kyurem-Black that can beat down bulky grass types, and physical walls with mixed attacking, and coverage moves are appreciated. Trappers, most notably Magnezone can work to beat some bulky steel checks to Barbaracle such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Bisharp. Barbaracle's HP and Special Defense are overall mediocre, removing hazards from your side conserve its precious HP that it needs to set and up and successfully sweep. Partners such as Excadrill, Scizor, Latios, or Starmie are appreciated.

Other Options
########

Barbaracle has a decent set of other moves outside of the main ones listed. X-Scissor and Poison Jab do the absolute most damage to bulkier Grass-types, and X-Scissor demolishes a would be counter; Celebi. Whereas Poison Jab does the most damage to Azumarill. These moves do notably more to Grass-types compared to stone edge thanks to tough claws. Dragon Claw is a clean OHKO on Garchomp, even a bulky Mega, but has little use otherwise. Taunt is the most notable option as it allows you to beat Skarmory one on one, as Brave Bird does little, and you can not be forced out by Whirlwind. It also facilitates some more opportunities to shell smash, against defensive Pokemon that would attempt to status you. However, giving up a coverage move for taunts makes sweeping easier to stop. Rock Slide can be subbed in for Stone Edge if you absolutely deplore missing, though the power drop is quite bad. Barbaracle is capable of a modestly proficient choice set, access to Switcheroo is a selling point as it is generally unexpected and will often be passed a defensive check like Skarmory, crippling it.

Checks & Counters
#########

**physical walls and tanks**: Bulky Pokemon that Barbaracle can't score super effective hits on, such as Skarmory, Mega Venusaur, Tangrowth, Physicall Defensive Clefable, or fairly bulky pokemon that have very favorable type match up such as Keldeo can comfortably take a +2 attack, and in nearly all cases have something to cripple it, KO it, or disrupt Barbaracle's sweep.

**Strong Priority**: Exceptionally strong priority users such as Scizor and Bisharp, or super effective priority attacks such as Mach Punch will always Barbaracle as ihas no priority of its own, and even though all but the absolute strongest can OHKO if Barbaracle has White Herb, if the opponent has 2 of these pokemon or more Barbaracle will get taken down.

**Prankster Status**: Barbaracle is vulnerable to both Paralysis, and Burn, thus Prankster status users such as Sableye, or Thundurus will be able to shut down Barbaracle in the middle of a sweep should it lack Lum Berry

**Incredibly Fast Choice Scarf Users**: Barbaracle is unable to outpace choice scarf users above base 105 speed, thus pokemon such as Keldeo or Latios are capable of revenge killing it should they have a scarf.

**Offensive Pressure**: Barbaracle's typing, and raw bulk are nothing to be impressed by, any reasonably strong attack will set up Barbaracle to be revenge killed by any priority or weak wall's attack stopping its sweep entirely.
