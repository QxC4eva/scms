<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts user's Attack and Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Bulk Up has become increasingly common this generation, and this is largely because of the arrival of excellent new abusers, as well as the buff to Drain Punch. Generally, the idea is to boost the weaker defensive stat, making your Pokemon very bulky on both sides, but also providing an offensive presence, rather than merely waiting for the opponent to get a critical hit. Any Fighting-type Pokemon with decent Special Defense can become very difficult to take down after having used Bulk Up, especially with Drain Punch for recovery and priority moves for faster, frailer, and more powerful opponents. Examples include Conkeldurr, Scrafty, Gallade, and Toxicroak. Though there is no particular reason to suppose that Fighting-types are automatically the best users of the move other than for STAB on Drain Punch, Bulk Up is distributed almost solely among Fighting-types, and at present there are few other viable users outside of Ubers, where Bulk Up Dialga and Palkia are occasionally seen. Indeed, there are certainly far more viable users of Curse, a move which should be seen as generally inferior.</p>
