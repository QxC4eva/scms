Picks one of the user's moves at random. Can only be used while sleeping.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Randomly selects a move in the user's current moveset, other than Sleep Talk, and uses it. The move fails if the user is not under the sleep status. The selected move does not have PP deducted from it, and can currently have 0 PP. If it selects the move Rest, it will automatically fail. In double or triple battles, it will always target the Pokemon directly opposite it on the field if a targeting move is used. If a move such as Outrage is selected, it will only be used for one turn, and will not cause the user to be confused. It will not select any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assist</li>
<li>Bide</li>
<li>Bounce</li>
<li>Chatter</li>
<li>Copycat</li>
<li>Dig</li>
<li>Dive</li>
<li>Fly</li>
<li>Focus Punch</li>
<li>Me First</li>
<li>Metronome</li>
<li>Mirror Move</li>
<li>Nature Power</li>
<li>Shadow Force</li>
<li>Sketch</li>
<li>Skull Bash</li>
<li>Sky Attack</li>
<li>SolarBeam</li>
<li>Razor Wind</li>
<li>Uproar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sleep Talk is not a bad move, but its usefulness has dipped because of BW's sleep mechanics. Due to the decreased reliability of the RestTalk combination, Sleep Talk has seen a lot less use. However, Pokemon who can still effectively run RestTalk, such as Giratina-O or Suicune, can still reap the full benefits of Sleep Talk, allowing them to attack or set up Calm Mind while healing with Rest.</p>
