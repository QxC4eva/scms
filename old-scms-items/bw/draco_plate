<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that increases the base power of all Dragon-type moves by 20% with the exception of Dragon Rage. When held by a Pokemon with the Multitype ability, the holder's type will change to Dragon.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Arceus can take advantage of this item to become a potent offensive threat. Being the fastest Dragon-type Pokemon in the entire game makes it a pretty big threat, and Arceus can abuse the power of Dragon-type STAB to the fullest with its incredible stats and enormous movepool, allowing it to run both Swords Dance and Calm Mind sets effectively in the Ubers metagame. Draco Plate can also be used in OU on Pokemon such as Latios, as it can be used to fake a Choice item, while continuing to boost the power of the Dragon-type move of choice.</p>
