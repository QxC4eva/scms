Halves Special damage done to user.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Halves Special damage done to user. Does not wear away until the user switches or faints. If Light Screen causes the user's Special to reach 1024 or higher at any time during battle calculations, it will be reduced mod 1024</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>A very good move given the power of special attackers. This move makes Chansey able to face non-Submission Mewtwo in Ubers and deal with Alakazam with more ease. Reflect is seen much more, but Light Screen is a good alternative to stop special attackers before they can wreck your team.</p>
