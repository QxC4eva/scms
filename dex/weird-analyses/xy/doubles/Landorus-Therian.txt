Overview
########
Landorus-T is one of the prime Intimidate users in Doubles. With its sky high attack, Landorus-T hits very hard especially with its STAB spread move Earthquake. Landorus-T has access to good offensive typing and coverage, with powerful spread moves in Rock Slide and STAB Earthquake dealing major damage to all the opponents on the field, while access to U-turn and Knock Off grants it greater utility and provides great coverage as well. Furthermore, a great defensive typing, with only weaknesses to Water and Ice but resists so much more in Fighting, Bug, and Poison while having two great immunities in Electric and Ground. Thanks to its well-rounded stats, Landorus is versatile and is very easy to fit onto teams. However, care must be taken to avoid burns, as it severely cuts Landorus-T's attack and also deals chip damage.

move 3: Protect
move 4: U-turn / Knock Off
ability: Intimidate

evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========
Earthquake is a strong STAB spread move that is can deal major damage to both opponents on the field. However, it also hurts the Landorus-T's partner as well so care must be taken to mitigate this. Rock Slide is a good spread move that has nice coverage with Earthquake and can also achieve a timely flinch on the opponents. Protect is useful for scouting moves, stalling out field conditions, or to survive a turn when it is predicted that the opponents will viciously attack Landorus-T. U-turn is good for Landorus-T to escape from the field when there is a bad matchup. Knock Off is good Dark-type coverage and can also neutralise the opponent's item.

Set Details
========
Focus Sash allows Landorus-T to live at least a powerful Ice Beam from a check, and take it down by surprise with a well-timed Earthquake or Stone Edge. Yache Berry is for Landorus-T to survive even powerful Ice-type attacks and retaliate back with a super effective Rock Slide. Life Orb is also an option to boost Landorus-T's damage tremendously and give it a major offensive presence, however the 10% recoil may be unattractive. Sitrus Berry is a last option to allow greater longevity for Landorus-T, allowing it to survive more hits and thus have more turns to deal damage. Intimidate helps neutralise both physical attackers on the opponent's field and give your teammates greater leeway and reduce damage taken. Jolly Nature helps Landorus to make use of its niche base 91 Speed and outspeed all base 90s and below. Adamant Nature helps Landorus deal as much damage as possible, with its great base 145 Attack being boosted even more.

Usage Tips
========
As Landorus-T functions as a great check to physical attackers thanks to its ability Intimidate, take opportunity to switch in on physical attacking opponents in order to cushion both Landorus-T and the partner from their onslaught. However, in the early game, opposing Intimidate users will be switching in to check Landorus-T's attacks as well, so usually U-turn should be used until these threats have been eliminated. Landorus-T can function well both defensively and offensively thanks to its high Attack as well, so it can be used to putting a lot of offensive pressure on opponents with powerful spread Earthquakes or Rock Slides. Against a threatening opponent with Water- or Ice-type coverage, Landorus-T should switch out into a more favorable teammate so that its Intimidate ability can be preserved.

Team Options
========
Flying-type and Levitate partners should be used to avoid the dangerous Earthquakes that Landorus-T uses. Togekiss, Cresselia and Thundurus are good examples that fulfill this criteria. Jirachi is awesome, as it can use Follow Me to deter burns and Ice type moves from striking Landorus-T, but it is weak to its teammate's Earthquake. Bulky Water-types cover Landorus-T's weaknesses. Azumarill is great at KOing the Intimidate Pokemon that check Landorus-T such as other Landorus, Hitmontop, and Scrafty. Suicune can take many hits while supporting Landorus-T with Tailwind, Icy Wind, or Snarl. MANY Pokemon appreciate the removal of Steel-types; Fairy-types like Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon, Steel-types such as Scizor and Mega Mawile, Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Venusaur, and Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Salamence all like having Landorus-T as a partner

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Stone Edge / Rock Slide
move 4: Explosion / Knock Off / Superpower
ability: Intimidate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 88 HP / 252 Atk / 168 Spe
nature: Adamant


Moves
========
Earthquake is the mandatory STAB move that also deals powerful spread damage onto the opponent. U-turn is great for throwing in an Intimidate onto the opponents then getting out of the battle fast. Stone Edge can be used as a concentrated Rock-type attack to deal more damage to a single target as compared to Rock Slide, while Rock Slide is a cool spread coverage move with a nice flinch rate. Explosion is to be used in a pinch to sacrifice Landorus-T and let it deal major damage to all opponents at the start of the turn. Knock Off cripples the opponent by removing their item, and also covering Ghost-types. Superpower is a final coverage move that allows Landorus-T to hit Dark- and Normal-types.

Set Details
========
Choice Scarf boosts Landorus-T's speed greatly, but locks it to a move. Intimidate cripples the opponents and gives Landorus-T and its partner quite a bit of cushioning to survive more turns. Adamant is used for maximum power but Jolly can be used to outrun Timid base 90 Speed opponents that hold a Choice Scarf.

Usage Tips
========
Most of the time, Landorus-T will be hitting and running with Intimidate; reducing their Attack to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Choice Scarf is a surprising set so don't expose the scarf until it gets a surprise KO. Landorus-T can function as a powerful late-game cleaner, but many Pokemon in Doubles are immune to Earthquake so be hesitant to use it early game. Landorus-T acts as a great revenge killer to faster threats such as Charizard, Kanghaskhan, Jirachi, Heatran, Excadrill and more. Use explosion to lure and deal a lot of damage to Landorus-T's checks such as Rotom-W and Keldeo, but DON'T SPAM EXPLOSION EARLY GAME! Wait until the time is right and when Landorus-T can't do much with its other attacks.

Team Options
========
Teammates with access to Wide Guard, such as Hitmontop and Aegislash, are recommended as they stop Blizzard which destroy Landorus-T. Wide Guard also protects them from Landorus-T's devastating Earthquakes, which is icing on the cake. Hitmontop also has Intimidate to completely neutralise the opponent's physical attackers, while Aegislash has great type synergy with Landorus-T, resisting Ice for Landorus-T while Landorus-T handles the Ground-type attacks aimed at it. Ghost-type partners are also useful as they are immune to Explosion; Aegislash receives a special mention as it fulfills the above role as well. Hitmontop and Mega Pinsir are great Feint users to counter opposing Wide Guard users, because Choice Scarf Landorus-T is hampered by Wide Guard spam. Bulky Water-types cover its weaknesses. Azumarill is great at KOing the Intimidate Pokemon that check Landoge such as other Landoge, Hitmontop, and Scrafty. Suicune can take many hits while supporting Landorus-T with Tailwind, Icy Wind, or Snarl. MANY Pokemon appreciate the removal of Steel-types; Fairy-types like Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon, Steel-types such as Scizor and Mega Mawile, Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Venusaur, Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Salamence all like having Landoge as a partner

Other Options
########

A Choice Band set is viable, but Landorus-T has a lack of speed to carry out this role at its full potential, so other users such as Excadrill can perform this role better. Hidden Power Ice is an option to kill other Landorus-T and is a clutch coverage option against some would-be counters.

On the Physical Attacker set, many other options are available. Assault Vest is great to cushion Landorus-T from special attacks, and works well with Intimidate covering physical attackers. However, Landorus-T has to forego Protect to use it. Substitute can be used to ease prediction, protect Landorus-T from status effects, and to act as a cushion against faster checks. Swords Dance or Rock Polish can be used to boost Landorus-T's stats to terrifying levels and sweep the opponent. Stealth Rock is great to check opposing Pokemon such as Charizard, Mega Pinsir and Talonflame, but it has less utility in Doubles as compared to Singles. Imprison can be interesting to prevent the opponent's usage of the same moves as Landorus-T, for example the common Earthquake and Rock Slide. Gravity is another interesting option to cripple the opponent's Flying-types and also reduce the evasion of all Pokemon on the field.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: 

Despite Landorus-T's great coverage and high attack, some bulky opponents with Ice-type coverage and resist Earthquake can put a dent in Landorus-T's health. Cresselia functions as a dangerous check with its massive bulk being able to take multiple attacks and can retaliate with Icy Wind, which has the added effect of lowering the speed of the Pokemon on your side of the field. Azumarill also has super effective priority or it can take a hit and Waterfall. Rotom-W is a major counter to Landorus-T, as it has immunity to Earthquake and is not weak to Rock-type attacks, yet can easily defeat Landorus-T with a Hydro Pump.

**Speed**: 

Faster Pokemon with an Ice-type attack will be able to defeat Landorus-T. These checks include but are not limited to Deoxys-A, Scarf Kyurem, Kingdra and Ludicolo in Rain, and Ice Shard users such as Mamoswine and Weavile. Take note that Shaymin-S and Deoxys-A can also OHKO with their STABs, after some prior damage has been inflicted onto Landorus-T.

**Speed Control**: 

Landorus-T dislikes Trick Room, especially the Choice Scarf set, so its partners should try its best to neutralise any Trick Room setters to allow Landorus-T to function at its best. Tailwind teams also fulfill the same effect.

**Utility Moves**: 

Due to the large amount of usage of spread moves, Landorus-T's strategy is foiled by users of Wide Guard, especially Hitmontop which also has Intimidate to cripple Landorus-T. Shuca Berry or Air Balloon Heatran can also OHKO Landorus-T easily with Hidden Power Ice, yet are able to withstand Earthquakes due to their item.

**Damage Control**: 

Burns and Intimidate also reduce the overall effectiveness and damage output of Landorus-T, so care should be taken to prevent these effects from happening onto it. These include Rotom-W and Trevenant for burns, while opposing Landorus-T or Scrafty are common Intimidate users.
