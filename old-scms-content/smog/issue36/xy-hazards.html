<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Entry hazards are a common sight in most competitive Pok&eacute;mon battles, often being used at the start or during the middle of a match. Entry hazards include Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock, and the newly-introduced Sticky Web. In this article, we'll be explaining why entry hazards are used, what effect they have on a battle, and how you can utilize them to their fullest extent.</p>

<h3>But why would anyone waste a turn just for a tiny amount of damage?</h3>

<p>The answers lies in one of competitive battling's most common mechanics: switching Pok&eacute;mon. Offensive pressure or momentum can often result in players switching out their Pok&eacute;mon to attain a more favorable matchup, and this is where entry hazards come into play. By slowly chipping away at a bulky wall or crippling a speedy sweeper, entry hazards can be crucial to a player's success or failure in a battle. Entry hazards can also break potential Focus Sashes, effectively rendering that specific opponent itemless. Some teams can also choose to forgo the use of entry hazards, and start a battle with immediate offensive presence, but this article is geared towards telling you why entry hazards are used, so that's for another article, another time.</p>

<h3>What kinds of entry hazards are there?</h3>

<p>Entry hazards can typically be separated into two categories: grounded and non-grounded hazards. Grounded hazards do not affect Flying-types or Pok&eacute;mon with the Levitate ability under normal circumstances, while non-grounded hazards affect all Pok&eacute;mon except those with the Magic Guard ability. Now without further ado, let me 'introduce' you to all the available entry hazards available in Generation VI:</p>

<div class="lblock">

  <h4>Stealth Rock</h4>

  <div class="sblock">
    <p>Stealth Rock is the most common entry hazard seen in standard competitive play, and for good reason. The mere presence of Stealth Rock keeps many threatening sweepers across all tiers at bay, and should they be forced in, they can be dispatched more easily. Stealth Rock's damage is calculated based on whether the Pok&eacute;mon is weak to the Rock-type.</p>
    <p>4x Resistance: 3.125% (1/32) Damage<br />
      2x Resistance: 6.25% (1/16) Damage<br />
      1x Neutrality: 12.5% (1/8) Damage<br />
      2x Weakness: 25% (1/4) Damage<br />
      4x Weakness: 50% (1/2) Damage</p>
    <p>This means that certain threats such as Talonflame and Charizard in OU are no longer as effective, losing half their health upon switching in due to their 4x weakness to Rock-type moves.</p>
    <p>In addition to this, Stealth Rock is the easiest entry hazard to set up, due to many Pok&eacute;mon having access to this move, and the fact that it only needs to be used once to remain effective. Stealth Rock is also the only entry hazard which is non-grounded, meaning that it is the only entry hazard that can affect Flying-types and Levitate users. All in all, Stealth Rock is easy to set up, and can pay huge dividends, but a team must always have an answer to Stealth Rock themselves.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Spikes</h4>

  <div class="sblock">
    <p>Spikes are the second most commonly seen entry hazard in competitive play, often seeing use in the lower tiers more so than the higher ones. Spikes function rather differently to Stealth Rock, dealing fixed damage to grounded targets and requiring more than one turn of setup. This essentially means that Spikes are better than Stealth Rock for Rock-resistant targets, such as Steel- and Ground-type Pok&eacute;mon. Spikes can be stacked up to three times, and the damage dealt to switch-ins is dependent on this.</p>
    <p>1 layer: 12.5% (1/8) Damage<br />
      2 layers: 18.75% (3/16) Damage<br />
      3 layers: 25% (1/4) Damage</p>
    <p>A constant 25% damage to all grounded targets regardless is sometimes better than Stealth Rock, depending on what your opponent has decided to bring. However, this comes at the cost of being more exclusive and needing more turns to set up. Generally, it is advised to use this on more balanced or stall-based teams, where turns to set up Spikes can be easily gained through defensive measures.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Toxic Spikes</h4>

  <div class="sblock">
    <p>Toxic Spikes are a slightly different variant of Spikes, and are most commonly found on stall teams. This particular entry hazard does not cause direct damage, instead it afflicts grounded targets with either the 'poisoned' or 'badly poisoned' status condition.</p>
    <p>1 layer: Poison status afflicted on target (constant 1/8th damage per turn)<br />
      2 layers: Badly poisoned status afflicted on target (1/16 x *# amount of turns in play)</p>
    <p>Just for clarification, the 'badly poisoned' status will inflict 1/16 damage on turn one, 1/8 damage on turn two, 3/16 damage on turn three, and so on and so forth.</p>
    <p>Due to their more residual-damaging nature, offensive teams tend to not use this entry hazard as instant damage is more beneficial to their playstyle. However, Toxic Spikes are still useful to cripple walls that lack cleric support, whittling them down over time. Depending on how well a player's team can stall out or wall the opponent, one might elect to use these instead of their non-poisonous counterpart. However, these entry hazards are not always useful. For example, you might predict a switch and use Thunder Wave to paralyze whatever comes in, but alas, the opposing Pok&eacute;mon is already poisoned and you have wasted a precious turn. Toxic Spikes are also handled more easily, as Poison-type Pok&eacute;mon absorb the Toxic Spikes and Steel-type Pok&eacute;mon are flat-out immune to them.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Sticky Web</h4>

  <div class="sblock">
    <p>With the advent of XY, a new entry hazard has arrived in the form of Sticky Web, a grounded entry hazard which lowers the Speed of switch-ins by one stage. This is especially helpful on teams with slower sweepers, giving them the edge on otherwise faster Pok&eacute;mon. Access to this entry hazard is quite uncommon and so is its use, but don't let that fool you into thinking that this is the least effective one. Sticky Web only needs to be set up once, and it can have a positive effect on almost any playstyle, but keep in mind that Pok&eacute;mon with Clear Body are not affected, and Pok&eacute;mon with the Defiant or Competitive ability can take advantage of this to gain a free +2 boost to their Attack and Special Attack respectively.</p>
  </div>

</div>
<h3>That's really neat, but how can I prevent the opponent from using these against me?</h3>

<p>Well, there are a number of ways that 'hazard control' can be asserted. Some of these have other uses as well, but that's kinda straying away from the topic. Anyway, these are the usual methods of hazard control.</p>

<div class="lblock">
  <h4>Rapid Spin</h4>
  <div class="sblock">

    <p>Rapid Spin is one method of removing entry hazards - from your side of the field specifically. Rapid Spin is a somewhat rare move, with only thirteen evolutionary chains having access to it, and out of those, only around half are viable in standard competitive play. Nonetheless, most serious competitive teams carry a Pok&eacute;mon with this move. Rapid Spin is also a damage-dealing move, which means that Taunt has no effect on it. However, Rapid Spin can easily be discouraged by the presence of opposing Ghost-types; a term coined as "spinblocking". Due to Rapid Spin being a Normal-type move, Ghost-types are not affected, and therefore the entry hazards are not removed. This makes Rapid Spin a less reliable method of hazard control in XY, but common users of this move such as Excadrill and Starmie can often threaten out the aforementioned Ghost-types, so smart prediction is the key to choosing when to use Rapid Spin.</p>

  </div>
  <h4>Defog</h4>
  <div class="sblock">

    <p>Prior to Generation VI, Defog was considered a largely useless HM move, never seeing use in the competitive scene. However, Defog is now the most reliable and common method of hazard control, due to changed mechanics allowing it to remove not just entry hazards, but also screens from both sides of the battlefield. Although Defog is blocked by Taunt, it is more commonly used due to its ability to be used on every Pok&eacute;mon, even Ghost-types. Unfortunately, Defog can be used by the opponent to their advantage, switching in a Pok&eacute;mon with either the Defiant or Competitive ability into a Defog and gaining a free +2 boost to their offenses. Despite the disadvantages, Defog is the most common method of hazard control throughout all tiers, leading to the rise of Pok&eacute;mon such as Defog support Arceus in Ubers, offensive Defog Latios in OU, and Defog Will-O-Wisp Mew in UU.</p>

  </div>
  <h4>Taunt</h4>
  <div class="sblock">

    <p>Failing to prepare is preparing to fail, and most competitive teams should carry a Taunt user to shut down set up sweepers, or in this case, to both keep your entry hazards on the field and prevent the opponent from setting theirs up. Taunt disables the opponent's non-damaging moves, meaning that they cannot use Defog or set up entry hazards. This is an invaluable tool against most entry hazard leads, but keep in mind that Shuckle and Deoxys-D often carry Mental Herb, and Mamoswine sometimes has the Oblivious ability.</p>

  </div>
  <h4>Magic Bounce and Magic Coat</h4>
  <div class="sblock">

    <p>Magic Bounce and Magic Coat are two incredibly useful tools in a player's arsenal, allowing the user to bounce back most non-damaging moves, including entry hazards. This essentially means that a player can have entry hazards set up on the opposing side of the field without even carrying a hazard setter. Magic Bounce and Magic Coat both require some prediction to use, but if used correctly, can be extremely beneficial. Pok&eacute;mon with the Magic Bounce ability include Espeon in OU, Mega Absol in UU, and Xatu in the lower tiers. Common users of Magic Coat include Deoxys-D and Smeargle in Ubers and UU, respectively.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<h2>Entry Hazard Setters</h2>

<p>There are many Pokemon that set or remove entry hazards. I will list one common Pokemon from each tier along with a set, and briefly explain why they are good at their jobs.</p>

<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/deoxys-speed.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">Ubers</div>
  <p>Deoxys-Speed @ Focus Sash<br />
  Ability: Pressure<br />
  EVs: 4 HP &#47; 252 Atk &#47; 252 Spe<br />
  Jolly Nature<br />
  - Stealth Rock<br />
  - Spikes<br />
  - Taunt<br />
  - Knock Off</p>
</div>

<p>Deoxys-Speed is naturally the fastest unboosted Pok&eacute;mon in the game, and with access to an expansive movepool containing Spikes and Stealth Rock. What better example of a lead hazard setter could you ask for? Focus Sash ensures that Deoxys-Speed will be able to set up at least one layer of hazards, a fast Taunt easily shuts down opposing hazard setters, and Knock Off provides some utility after its main job is done.</p>
<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/landorus-therian.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">OU</div>
  <p>Landorus-Therian (M) @ Leftovers<br />
  Ability: Intimidate<br />
  EVs: 252 HP &#47; 252 Def &#47; 4 Spe<br />
  Impish Nature<br />
  - Stealth Rock<br />
  - Earthquake<br />
  - Stone Edge<br />
  - U-turn</p>
</div>

<p>Landorus-T is a great offensive pivot with Intimidate and access to Stealth Rock. Its typing and ability allows it to easily switch into most physical attackers in the OU tier, and set up hazards as they switch out. It even has access to U-turn, to keep momentum for the team. Landorus-T is no slouch on the offensive side either, having a great base 145 Attack and access to EdgeQuake, making it useful as an offensive pivot even after hazards have been set up.</p>

<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/galvantula.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">UU</div>
  <p>Galvantula @ Focus Sash<br />
  Ability: Compound Eyes<br />
  EVs: 252 SpA &#47; 4 SpD &#47; 252 Spe<br />
  Timid Nature<br />
  - Sticky Web<br />
  - Thunder<br />
  - Bug Buzz<br />
  - Volt Switch</p>
</div>

<p>Galvantula is one of the few Pok&eacute;mon that has access to XY's new entry hazard: Sticky Web. Galvantula is one of the fastest Pok&eacute;mon in the UU tier, allowing it to set up a Sticky Web most of the time in conjunction with its Focus Sash. Its Compound Eyes ability allows Thunder to hit 91% of the time, making it a strong, spammable STAB attack to be used after setting up Sticky Web. Bug Buzz provides a secondary STAB move to hit Ground-types, and Volt Switch enables it to be saved for later, to either set up Sticky Web once more or to be used as death fodder.</p>

<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/cobalion.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">RU</div>
  <p>Cobalion @ Leftovers<br />
  Ability: Justified<br />
  EVs: 252 Atk &#47; 4 Def &#47; 252 Spe<br />
  Jolly Nature<br />
  - Stealth Rock<br />
  - Iron Head<br />
  - Close Combat<br />
  - Volt Switch</p>
</div>

<p>Cobalion's great typing, natural bulk, and plethora of switch-in opportunities make it an excellent offensive Stealth Rock user in RU. Its support capabilities aren't just limited to setting up Stealth Rock; Iron Head provides a reliable STAB attack and Volt Switch lets Cobalion act as a pivot. STAB Close Combat is a powerful attack that can dent a lot of Pok&eacute;mon, making Cobalion a versatile and powerful threat.</p>

<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/accelgor.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">NU</div>
  <p>Accelgor @ Focus Sash<br />
  Ability: Unburden<br />
  EVs: 252 HP &#47; 4 SpA &#47; 252 Spe<br />
  Timid Nature<br />
  - Spikes<br />
  - Bug Buzz &#47; Energy Ball<br />
  - Encore<br />
  - Final Gambit</p>
</div>

<p>Accelgor is excellent at setting up Spikes, having blazing fast Speed and decent Special Attack. It also has access to Unburden, and along with Focus Sash, allows it to set up multiple layers of Spikes. Energy Ball and Bug Buzz are decent moves and ensure that Accelgor is not setup fodder for Seismitoad and Mesprit respectively. Besides setting up Spikes, Accelgor can also function as an effective one-time spinblock with Final Gambit, or pave the way for a setup sweeper with Encore.</p>

<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/dwebble.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">LC</div>
  <p>Dwebble @ Berry Juice<br />
  Ability: Sturdy<br />
  EVs: 236 Atk &#47; 236 Spe<br />
  Jolly Nature<br />
  - Stealth Rock<br />
  - Spikes<br />
  - Rock Blast<br />
  - Knock Off</p>
</div>

<p>Dwebble is one of the most common leads in the LC metagame, and rightly so. Its Sturdy ability in combination with Berry Juice allows it to usually set up two layers of entry hazards, something other leads in higher tiers cannot hope to consistently do. Rock Blast breaks through Substitutes and Focus Sashes, while Knock Off is especially useful in LC, removing precious Eviolites and Berry Juices.</p>

<h2>Hazard Controllers</h2>

<p>While some Pok&eacute;mon may be adept at setting up entry hazards, there are also many Pok&eacute;mon capable on removing them. Some prominent examples across all the tiers are shown below:</p>

<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/arceus-ghost.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">Ubers</div>
  <p>Arceus-Ghost @ Spooky Plate<br />
  Ability: Multitype<br />
  EVs: 252 HP &#47; 144 Def &#47; 112 Spe<br />
  Timid Nature<br />
  - Judgment<br />
  - Recover<br />
  - Defog<br />
  - Will-O-Wisp</p>
</div>

<p>Many Arceus formes have a support set, but Arceus-Ghost is the only one that can spinblock, even if Rapid Spin users are rarely seen in the Ubers metagame. The Arceus formes' outstanding 120 / 120 / 120 bulk make them all solid candidates for a defensive role, and access to high Base Power STAB moves in Judgement, reliable healing in Recover, and utility in Defog and Will-O-Wisp make them very effective, albeit predictable hazard controllers. Keep in mind, however, that many Arceus formes choose to take on an offensive role, and the Arceus's typing will not be revealed in Team Preview, so be wary of trying to set up on one.</p>

<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/latios.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">OU</div>
  <p>Latios @ Life Orb<br />
  Ability: Levitate<br />
  EVs: 4 HP &#47; 252 SpA &#47; 252 Spe<br />
  Timid Nature<br />
  - Draco Meteor<br />
  - Psyshock<br />
  - Recover &#47; Hidden Power Fire<br />
  - Defog</p>
</div>

<p>An example of a somewhat rare offensive Defogger, Latios is a constant presence in the OU metagame capable of forcing many switches, which it capitalizes on to remove entry hazards. Latios's high Special Attack and Speed allow it to hit extremely fast and hard, effortlessly threatening most of the tier with its dual STAB moves. Draco Meteor and Psyshock allow it to hit from both sides of the spectrum, Recover enables Latios to stay healthy throughout the match and Defog more than once if needed, Hidden Power Fire hits common switch-ins such as Bisharp and Ferrothorn, and Defog clears entry hazards from the battlefield. As an offensive Defogger, Latios can also fill an attacking role if the opponent does not carry entry hazards, making it more flexible if elected as a hazard controller.</p>

<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/absol-mega.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">UU</div>
  <p>Mega Absol @ Absolite<br />
  Ability: Pressure -> Magic Bounce<br />
  EVs: 252 Atk &#47; 4 SpA &#47; 252 Spe<br />
  Hasty &#47; Naive Nature<br />
  - Knock Off<br />
  - Sucker Punch<br />
  - Fire Blast &#47; Ice Beam<br />
  - Superpower &#47; Play Rough</p>
</div>

<p>Mega Absol's Magic Bounce ability deters all kinds of entry hazards and status moves, simply by being in play. Clever switch-ins can even allow you to 'set up' your own entry hazards, and most common leads are forced out, fearing an attack from a fearsome base 150 Attack. A mixed set is very viable on Mega Absol due to its solid base 115 Special Attack, granting it precious coverage options to surprise would-be checks. Mega Absol is also one of the most threatening Pok&eacute;mon in the tier, making the opponent think twice before switching something in or attempting to set up entry hazards as long as it is still alive.</p>

<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/hitmonlee.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">RU</div>
  <p>Hitmonlee @ Life Orb<br />
  Ability: Reckless<br />
  EVs: 4 HP &#47; 252 Atk &#47; 252 Spe<br />
  Adamant Nature<br />
  - High Jump Kick<br />
  - Knock Off<br />
  - Mach Punch &#47; Sucker Punch<br />
  - Rapid Spin</p>
</div>

<p>Hitmonlee is not only RU's resident 'nuke' button, but also a very capable spinner which can threaten potential Ghost-type switch-ins such as Cofagrigus with a powerful Knock Off. A Life Orb-boosted High Jump Kick destroys almost anything that doesn't resist it, allowing Hitmonlee to generate opportunities to spin by forcing opponents out. Mach Punch and Sucker Punch allow it to pick off weakened opponents attempting to revenge kill or spinblock. Rapid Spin, while generally outclassed by Defog, is still immensely useful, due to the presence of Braviary in RU.</p>

<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/archeops.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">NU</div>
  <p>Archeops @ Leftovers<br />
  Ability: Defeatist<br />
  EVs: 252 Atk &#47; 4 Def &#47; 252 Spe<br />
  Jolly Nature<br />
  - Taunt &#47; Defog<br />
  - Roost<br />
  - U-turn<br />
  - Stone Edge &#47; Stealth Rock</p>
</div>

<p>Archeops is typically played in an offensive role due to its impressive offensive stats and blazing fast Speed, but it is also just as capable in a supporting role. With access to the fastest Taunt in the tier, it can shut down most opposing leads looking to get up their entry hazards. Archeops even gets access to Defog and Stealth Rock, meaning it can potentially prevent setup, remove hazards, and set them up itself. Roost and Leftovers allows it to stay out of Defeatist range and keep its attacks at full power, while U-turn lets it pivot out to gain an advantageous matchup.</p>

<div class="set">
  <img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/drilbur.gif" alt="" />
  <div class="tier">LC</div>
  <p>Drilbur @ Eviolite &#47; Life Orb<br />
  Ability: Mold Breaker<br />
  EVs: 36 HP &#47; 236 Atk &#47; 212 Spe<br />
  Jolly Nature<br />
  - Rapid Spin<br />
  - Earthquake<br />
  - Rock Slide<br />
  - Swords Dance</p>
</div>

<p>Drilbur fills the same role in LC that its evolution Excadrill does in OU: a great offensive spinner. With a high Attack stat, decent bulk, and good Speed, Drilbur can often remove entry hazards in a clutch situation. Drilbur also has access to the Rock Slide/Earthquake combination, making it a fearsome sweeper if the Rapid Spin support is unneeded, and Swords Dance is just the icing on the cake.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Entry hazards are an integral part of competitive battling, regardless of whether they are applied in an offensive or defensive role. Entry hazards are by no means necessary to do well in battling, but bear in mind that they will almost always be omnipresent in the competitive scene. They may not be present in every single battle, but nonetheless, any seasoned veteran will carry entry hazards, or at the very least, a countermeasure to them. There is a motto inscribed on the wall of my local gym: "Failing to prepare is preparing to fail", a piece of wisdom which can surely be applied to the presence of entry hazards; make sure you have an answer to these levitating stones and scattered Lego pieces, or else you might just find yourself between a rock and a hard place.</p>
