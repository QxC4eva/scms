<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to freeze the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The second half of the acclaimed BoltBeam combination, Ice Beam is powerful and perfectly accurate. It is freely available as a TM, thus allowing many Pokemon, most notably Water-types, to learn it. Speaking of Water-type Pok√©mon, thanks to Ice Beam, Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon aren't completely safe when facing them. Starmie is a great user of this move&mdash;with Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Surf. It also has chance to freeze, which is basically a KO in RBY. It's a key move for Chansey fighting against Exeggutor, other Chansey, and Alakazam, fishing for a game-winning freeze. Very good move that should be used often.</p>
