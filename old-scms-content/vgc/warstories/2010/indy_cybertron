<p>Hi guys! Aaron/Cybertron/Serendipity here. Yep, this is my Nationals warstory! I'm sorry this is so late, I kinda lost motivation when I got back from camp but well now it's finally up...</p>

<h2>Background Information...</h2>

<p>For those that don't know, I placed in the Top 8 (4?) at the NY VGS as a Junior in 2008. That was my first real taste of VGS/VGC. After failing at Worlds from being haxed out in my first round, I knew that I would come back in the future ready. Fast forward to the 2009 season. Sadly, I didn't win the lottery at Regionals and that ended my 09 season. It also ended my time as a Junior. I knew that 2010 was going to be much more different, and that I had to be ready. The first time I got to experience 2010 VGC style was with Alaka's tournament. That made my status as a nobody turn into, well, a somewhat nobody. The first time I got to prove myself was at the NJ Regionals. I somehow managed to get 4th place (and my Juniors brother placed 3rd), and that's what leads into the actual warstory....</p>

<p>(If you actually read that, bravo ^.^)</p>

<h2>Friday, June 25th</h2>

<p>Unlike most people, I arrived the afternoon on Friday. Fortunately, the weather was flawless so my dad, brother and I had a smooth commute over to Indiana, just under two hours. The flight gave me some time to consider what to use as my team (and what my brother should use.) I knew that I would probably stick with Misa Room, as it was the one team I felt was fit for me. Ever since Alaka's tournament, it was the one team I stuck with. The only problem with Misa Room is that the smallest amount of hax can turn around a game. I decided that hax would be on my side (what a frigging JOKE that was) and confirmed it as my team.</p>

<p>Anyways, we make it to Indy right around noon. We check into our hotel (which was a mile away T_T) and head to the convention center. Not much happens on Friday, mainly hanging around the convention center with TCG friends and chilling. I manage to sleep at like 12 for once after a tiring day.</p>

<h2>Saturday, June 26th</h2>

<p>Oh dear, it's the big day! I head to the convention center pretty early. Nothing too special, soon enough pairings are up and the tournament starts.</p>

<h3>65 people with 7 rounds of Swiss, a Top 16 cut.</h3>

<h3>Round 1: Robert I. (Grinded In) [Final Record - 2-5]</h3>

<p>He tells me he grinded in, so right of the bat I'm a bit intimidated since he had to be somewhat good to have made it in. I begin to take notes for future purposes but then I'm told that I can't... I disappointingly put away my little blue notebook and focus on the battle.</p>

<p>He leads with Dusknoir and something slow, so I'm able to assume that he's running Trick Room right off the bat. *grins* Considering I was running Trick Room as well (and he probably did not see that from my leads), I allowed him to set up Trick Room while I Dark Voided/Dragon Pulsed everything. When he finally got a Trick Room up, I sent out my Kyogre to counter his Kyogre and Abomasnow. My Kyogre was slower than his so I managed to Thunder him first, and I OHKO'd Abomasnow with a Flamethrower from Dialga. Next turn, I finished Kyogre. Good game. I win 3-0.</p>

<p><strong>Record: 1-0</strong></p>

<h3>Round 2: Forgot Name [Final Record: 1-6]</h3>

<p>I don't remember who my opponent was this round, but after seeing his leads, I kind of freaked. He lead with Blissey and Registeel. I didn't predict him at all and he manages to explode with Registeel around the 3rd turn or so, taking down everything except Dialga. I didn't want to set up Trick Room because Registeel would then outspeed Dialga and co. After his leads were gone, he sent out more reasonable Ubers (Kyogre and Palkia? I believe.) I set up Trick Room and win 3-0.</p>

<p><strong>Record: 2-0</strong></p>

<h3>Round 3: Daniel L. aka dtrain [Final Record: 4-3]</h3>
<p>...you're kidding me right :( I look at the pairings and I find that I'm battling one of my fellow New Yorkers and friend, Dan. Out of anyone I could have played... I sigh as we both set up and get ready to battle. We call Marriland over because he makes a mistake on items and it wastes like 5 minutes and they don't give us any extra time lol. Don't call Marriland over next time :(</p>

<p>Since he thought I wasn't running Misa Room, he leads with Abomasnow and Mewtwo. For those that don't know, that was the exact same team my little brother was running as well. I Fake Out the Mewtwo and Flamethrower the Abomasnow, leaving him one Pokemon down as I have not taken any damage yet. I later set up Trick Room and win 3-0. Good game, Dan :(</p>

<p><strong>Record: 3-0</strong></p>

<h3>Round 4: Judd P. aka Kongler [Final Record: 5-2]</h3>

<p>I look at the pairings and sigh again. Looks like it's not going to be an easy ride anymore. The battle was pretty haxxy, and I end up winning because of a critical hit on his Toxicroak. I'm not sure if that would have been game or not, but it probably would have been a win for him. I end up PP Stalling his Kyogre's Water Spout, and Thundering his Ludicolo with my Kygore in the end (with a useless crit.) I kinda felt bad, but he was awesome about the hax an the lost. Good game, I win 2-0? 1-0?</p>

<p><strong>Record: 4-0</strong></p>

<p>At this point, I'm feeling great in the tournament. I'm undefeated, and I've played at Table 1 in my last battle so I'm seeded first/second right now. I somehow managed to pull a victory against two great players with a little luck and a lot of prediction. Just 1 more victory and I'm into Worlds - heck, I can lose all my battles and still make it to Worlds. Little did I know then.... I have a terrible curse of always going undefeated in a tournament, then losing all my matches after that to miss cut my 1 or 2 places. Happened at TCG States this year too. There are only a few 4-0's at this point, so I feel that I really have a good shot.</p>

<h3>Round 5: BadIntent (Record: 7-0)</h3>

<p>Oh man, it's BadIntent! I didn't recognize his name but when he walks over to the table, I die a bit inside. We delay the battle because he has to change some items, but it's all good. He leads off with Infernape and T-Tar. I'm feeling okay, because as long as I can set up Trick Room, those two die to a Water Spout. I use Follow Me, as Fake Out and Rock Slide proceed to kill it. Then Dialga flinches and does NOT set up Trick Room. 3/10 of a chance and it happened. I send out Kyogre as he kills my Dialga and does about 20% to Kyogre, as I attempt to Spout. He flinches me again :( At this point, I've given up and I'm about to be 4-0'd. I send out Abomasnow and he finishes me off. If I hadn't flinched that one turn with Trick Room, the game would have ended up much differently. He still might have won, but I at least wanted to give a fighting chance.</p>

<p><strong>Record: 4-1</strong></p>

<h3>Round 6: Mr. National Champion [Record 5-2]</h3>

<p>I don't recognize the name to be the name of a Smogoner so I kind of relax. Turns out he ended up winning the whole thing. This was the one battle I really regret, as I actually completely misplayed. He leads with Raquaza and Kangaskhan. I go with Follow Me and Trick Room, and set up Trick Room. This is going exactly how I wanted it to go, I'm thinking. I then bring out Abomasnow over Kyogre, my biggest misplay -_- I don't know what the hell I was thinking, I forgot about Air Lock. I Blizzard and Dragon Pulse, and Blizzard.... hits Kangaskhan. I'm praying that it hits Raquaza but it doesn't. :(. He Air Slashes me which OHKO's me, and I finish Raquaza off with Dragon Pulse. After this turn, I'm completely baffled at what just happened. I sent out Kyogre but he manages to win 2-0 at the end. I'm really pissed off at myself for allowing such a loss, and I'm 4-2 at this point. I went from 1st seed to the mid 10's. I say good game and walk away shamefully. :(</p>

<p><strong>Record: 4-2</strong></p>

<h3>Round 7: Danny Z. aka TTS [Record 5-2]</h3>

<p>Not TTS! I kinda knew the battle was over before it started and that my chances to Worlds were over now. The winner of the battle would make it to the Top 16 while the loser did not. I realized that had we tied, we both would have made it in. Instead, he completely out predicts me and I lose 3-0? It was the only fair loss I had, with hardly any hax. I shake TTS' hand and we walk out to wait for final standings.</p>

<p><strong>Record: 4-3</strong></p>

<p>STANDINGS TIME! I hurry and use my short height to my advantage and slip through everyone, haha. I see my name before I see my rank, and there's a chance! It's not that low! *scrolls down.... 17th Aaron Zheng* roflwatnowai. dreamcrushed. I was the second highest 4-3, with Rory as the highest. I was honestly surprised, as I thought my resistance would be high losing to the only 7-0, 3 5-2's, and a 4-3. Turned out that my round 1 and 2 opponents did not do so well, going 2-5 and 1-6. Had they won just one more battle, I would have been in 16th place rather than 17th. I was really depressed, not only from the fact that I didn't make it in but 17th just sucks. Guess that's biting me in the butt for when I got the last TCG rating invite in 2008. :( I hang around the convention center, ranting my butt off to everyone I know. My last chance is my little brother, who's about to compete in the Juniors division.</p>

<h2>Quick Overview of Brendan's Day</h2>

<p>He starts off the tournament 2-0. He manages to beat Grace Arnold, which surprises me to be honest and really gives me hope. Both his round 1 and his round 2 opponents later qualified for Worlds, congrats! I'm not sure who he faced Round 3, but he losed. In Round 4, he faced the brother of xerograde, who finishes the tournament in 2nd place. At this point, he's 2-2 and he's a bit upset himself. I tell him he still has a chance and he goes into round 5 against the Juniors winner of Texas. He loses, but shortly after Round 6 begins, he's disqualified for having a hacked Marowak. (Not my brother, the texas junior...) They can't do anything about the loss. My brother's really mad, and to be honest, so am I. He probably got it from the GTS, but still, it's freaking Nationals... He finishes 3-3 in 26th place. I think he probably would have made it had he gotten the win against Cedric, the Texas winner because he battled 3 Top 16 kids that day. I guess I need to make sure he calls a hack check next year :(</p>
