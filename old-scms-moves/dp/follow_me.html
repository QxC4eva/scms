[SHORT DESC]
All moves target the user.

[LONG DESC]
<p>All targeted moves used by the opponent target the user, regardless of the intended target.</p>

<p>If a Pokemon with Lightningrod and a Pokemon using Follow Me are out at the same time, and a Pokemon uses an Electric attack targeted at the Follow Me user's team, Follow Me will still take precedence and absorb the attack. If a Pokemon with Storm Drain and a Pokemon using Follow Me are out at the same time, and a Pokemon uses a Water attack targeted at the Follow Me user's team, Follow Me will still take precedence and absorb the attack.</p>

<p>If both enemies use Follow Me in the same round, moves will target whichever Pokemon used Follow Me second.</p>
