[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage, and the user receives recoil damage equal to 1/3 of the damage dealt, rounded half up, but not less than 1 HP. Has a 10% chance to burn the target. If the user is frozen, using this move will thaw it out immediately.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>With 120 Base Power and 100% accuracy, Flare Blitz is one of the best physical Fire-type moves in the game. It is often the first choice on any Pokemon lucky enough to have access to it, although the recoil can be problematic for those with low base HP, such as Infernape. If this is undesirable, Fire Punch is an acceptable substitute. Darmanitan in particular is dangerous with this move, as its already high Attack, STAB, and the 1.3x boost provided by Sheer Force makes it one of the heaviest hitters in the game.</p>
