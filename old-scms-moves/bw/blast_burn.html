<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Provided the move hits, the user must recharge the following turn, and may not attack or switch.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Blast Burn has little by way of competitive merit. Though it may be the most powerful special Fire-type move available, tied with full-health Eruption, this move is outdamaged over two turns by other moves such as Flamethrower, Lava Plume, and Fire Blast. Most crucially, though, the recharge turn leaves the opponent to do whatever they wish, making the move a serious liability.</p>
