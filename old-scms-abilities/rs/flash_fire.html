[SHORT DESC]
Grants immunity to Fire and increases Fire's power 50% when hit by a Fire move. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>When this Pok√©mon is hit by a Fire move, it takes no damage and its Fire-type moves increase in power by 50%. Further hits by Fire moves simply do no damage; they do not provide additional boosts. This power boost is lost upon switching out. Will-O-Wisp does not activate Flash Fire if used on a Fire-type Pokemon, but if the Flash Fire Pokemon is not a Fire-type, Flash Fire will activate. If a Pokemon with Flash Fire is frozen, when it is hit by a Fire move, it will be defrosted and take damage without boosting Flash Fire.</p>
