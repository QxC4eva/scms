<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Has a 30% chance to lower the target's Special one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Psychic is probably the most powerful move in the game without drawbacks. A high chance to drop Special, which will ruin half the Pokemon in OU, high damage, and 100% accuracy make this move the ultimate asset to any Pokemon that gets STAB on it. This move is mainly used by Alakazam and Exeggutor in OU and Mewtwo in Ubers. It's also the best move to deal with Snorlax and Chansey, as the constant Special drops will make it easier to defeat them.</p>
