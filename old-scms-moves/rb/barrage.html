[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hits 2-5 times in one turn. There is a 37.5% chance to hit either 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% chance to hit either 4 or 5 times. All hits will deal the same damage as the first hit. If the first hit is a critical hit, all subsequent hits will be critical hits. The move will be interrupted if one hit does faint a Substitute.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>It doesn't matter that your strong rival and champion Gary used this move, Barrage is still a very poor attack. Even if all five hits land, it is still no more powerful then a 75 Base Power Normal-type attack. This coupled with its mediocre 85% accuracy and its limited distribution (it is exclusive to Exeggcute and Exeggutor) makes Barrage a horrible attack with no competitive merit. Do not use this.</p>
