[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder cannot be infatuated. <a href="/bw/moves/captivate">Captivate</a> has no effect on the wielder. If the wielder is infatuated, it is instantly cured of infatuation.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Infatuation-inducing effects and Captivate are seldom used, making Oblivious terribly useless. Every Pokemon with Oblivious can use two other abilities, and at least one of them is vastly superior. Steer away from it.</p>
