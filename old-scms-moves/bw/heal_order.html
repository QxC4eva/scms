<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals the user by 1/2 of its maximum HP, rounded half up.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Vespiquen is lucky in that it gets not one, but two instant recovery moves in the form of Heal Order and Roost; both have different secondary effects. Roost is usually the better recovery move for Vespiquen as it softens up Rock-type attacks that can heavily dent or KO Vespiquen. However, if you hate losing the resistances Vespiquen's Flying typing brings when using Roost, Heal Order is a good alternative.</p>
