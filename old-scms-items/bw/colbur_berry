Reduces damage from a super effective Dark-type attack by 50%. Consumed after use.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by a Pokemon, reduces the power of a damaging Dark-type move that would hit the holder for super effective damage by 50%. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Dark-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While Colbur Berry was a pretty nifty way for Azelf to combat opposing leads in DPP, sadly with the demise of the lead in BW it has rather lost its usefulness. Certainly it could help in some circumstances, as Pursuit is a very common move indeed and many Psychic-types would appreciate being able to switch out without too much worry, the bulkier ones, like Slowbro, would typically prefer Leftovers, and the frailer ones, such as Alakazam, will be taking colossal damage regardless, and the extra survivability does not quite make up for the loss of power from Life Orb or a Choice item.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Wild Chimecho (5%).</p>
<p>Receive from Fennel on first visit to Dream Worldâ€”however, you only get one of the seventeen damage-reducing Berries, and this event cannot be repeated. If you do not receive a Colbur Berry in this way, you must trade for it using Share Shelves in the Dream World.</p>
