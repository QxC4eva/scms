<h3>Who is Bummer?</h3>

<p>I'm a dude who has both been drawing and playing Pokémon early on, but only in recent years have I decided to combine those two interests into one. I use both a tablet and a scanner in my work, while Photoshop CS2 is my right hand for creating and polishing my images. I've known about Smogon for a long time, and I made <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=84582">my own thread</a> in Smeargle's Studio when I began to crave feedback for my work, as well as taking an opportunity to get to know my audience. I started to post in other threads, get familiar with people, and in the end I wanted to give something back to the community which had treated me well.</p>

<p>I have no professional art education though. I work as a licensed clinical laboratory scientist, so my actual job is entirely different ahaha. I'm a swede, born and raised, so that affects how available I can be on the forums and IRC. Not much of a competitive battler though, but right now I'm dipping my feet into the NU tier and we'll see if I can get around swimming or not.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>

<p>I can hold my breath for 116 seconds.</p>

<p>I also earned the artist badge for my contributions to the <a href="/smog/issue21/">21th issue</a> of The Smog.</p>

<p>Oh, and I run and manage a Pokémon webcomic, <a href="http://www.rarecandytreatment.com/">Rare Candy Treatment</a>.</p>
