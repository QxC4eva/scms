[SHORT DESC]
Will OHKO the target.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Does damage equal to the target's max HP. If the target uses Endure or is holding a Focus Sash, it will leave them with 1 HP. If Lock-On or Mind Reader has been used the previous turn, or if the user or the target has the ability No Guard, Guillotine will hit. Guillotine ignores all other accuracy and evasion modifiers, but instead has its own accuracy formula.

<code><var>Accuracy</var> = ((<var>U</var>â€”<var>T</var>) + 30) / 100</code>

<dl>
<dt>U</dt>
<dd>Level of the user</dd>

<dt>T</dt>
<dd>Level of the target</dd>
</dl>

Guillotine fails if the user's level is less than the target's level.
