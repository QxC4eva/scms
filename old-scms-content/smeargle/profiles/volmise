<h3>Who is Volmise?</h3>

<p>A newer artist to the Smogon crew, I jumped on the scene late 2011 and began posting my artworks in Smeargle. Over time I've contributed multiple images to The Smog, and have even have one of my very own pieces presented as the cover image of issue #17.</p>

<p>I began drawing at a very young age, however my abilities hovered around 'less than great' until around the age of 18 when I was given a tablet for my birthday. I'd be lying if I didn't say Pokémon and anything similar were why I began drawing in the first place - even now as an adult I can't seem to rip myself from the clutches of these adorable and amazing creatures. As time has gone on, and with helpful tips and critique from many artists, I've slowly begun to leave my comfort zones and try new things, including backgrounds, painted shading, and uneven linework. As is very obvious, my style hovers around bright, rich colors, thick linework, and more often than not cute subject material.</p>

<p>My favorite Pokémon are very evident in my artwork, and are as follows: Pikachu, Volbeat, Illumise, and Gardevoir.</p>

<p>My art thread is located <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3454289">here</a>; you're welcome to dig through my works, new and old, and give your opinions of them! Don't worry, I don't bite~!</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, I drew the cover art for The Smog Issue #17, and have also been granted an Artist's Badge for my work with The Smog in general.</p>
