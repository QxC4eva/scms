[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to flinch the target. Does double damage when the target is under the effects of Minimize.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Although Stomp seems like a decent move to use due to its relatively high chance to flinch the target, it is outclassed due to its low power and poor distribution, mainly to generally slow Pokemon who cannot take advantage of the high flinch rate. Sadly, no Pokemon with Serene Grace learn Stomp.</p>
