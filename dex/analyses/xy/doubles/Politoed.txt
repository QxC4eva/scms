Overview
########

- Politoed is the only Drizzle user in the metagame.
- Politoed has a great Water-typing which is very useful defensively and has fair defensive stats, which allows Politoed to last on the battlefield for a while
- The usage of Politoed permits the option to run rain teams, which is deadly in Doubles due to moves spread moves Surf and Muddy Water receiving a boost.
- Pure Water-typing leaves it weak to Electric and Grass type attacks, which can be a problem.
- In addition its offenses are good but not great, so its damage output can be underwhelming.
- Politoed counters Tyranitar, Charizard Y, Heatran and Lando-T! You don't even need a dedicated rain team to use it for that reason. Icy Wind+Helping Hand+making sure sashes don't get broken by sand+weakening fire can make Toed worth running without even having Rain abusers.

Rain Setter
########
name: Rain Setter
move 1: Scald
move 2: Icy Wind / Perish Song
move 3: Helping Hand / Encore
move 4: Protect
ability: Drizzle
item: Sitrus Berry / Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========
- Scald is the main attack, Water STAB with great neutral coverage, and the 30% burn chance comes in hand at times. Also more accurate than Hydro Pump
- Icy Wind is to hit Grass and Dragon-types that resist Politoed's Water-type STAB, and also a form of speed control on the field. Although Icy Wind doesn't even do satisfactory damage to Grass- and Dragon-types unless it is 4x super effective, the Speed Drop for both opponents is extremely enticing.
- Perish Song can be used to KO both opponents on the field after three turns, also functioning as a phazer or to force out the opponents and their field effects.
- Helping Hand is useful to boost the damage of your allies in a pinch, and puts the opponent under a lot of pressure since you'll likely attack first.
- Encore is a great move to neutralize opposing status abusers or setup sweepers by locking them into the same move for 2 or more turns.
- For the second and third moveslot, Politoed can viably run any of those four moves in whatever combination the user wants. Each move supports the team in a different way.
- Protect is used to shield Politoed from damage, scout for opponent's attacks and stall harmful field conditions.

Set Details
========
- The EV spread provides maximum physical bulk to Politoed.
- A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD can be used as well.
- However, the physical defensive EVs are generally better than the specially defensive EVs because Politoed's weaknesses are specially attacking types.
- Sitrus Berry is generally used to give back a chunk of health in a pinch, potentially saving Politoed from being KOed
- Leftovers is also an option if you're expecting Politoed to be on the field for a long time
- Bold is the preferred nature for more physical bulk

Usage Tips
========
- Using this to setup rain, then allow teammates to sweep. Try your best to keep Politoed alive for as long as possible.
- When you see your opponent has many threatening Pokemon that are faster than yours, Icy Wind is a good way to turn the tables
- Just don't use use Icy Wind on Bisharp, as Defiant will result in a painful backlash.
- If you don't have much to damage a Pokemon with, using Scald to fish for a burn can be a decent idea
- Helping Hand is useful to boost the damage of a faster teammate, and is great to help the likes of Kingdra or Ludicolo achieve 2 kills in one Surf.
- With Encore, it is important to nab the opponent on the predicted Substitute or boosting move because most sweepers outspeed Politoed. Using Encore while a Pokemon has just attacked you is unfortunate.
- For more dedicated rain teams, it is important to play cautiously and keep Politoed alive as long as possible. This also helps for cleaning late game with Perish Song.

Team Options
========
- Swift Swim abusers such as Ludicolo and Kingdra who love rain a lot and can have their STAB options boosted as well under rain. Kingdra uses Muddy Water and Ludicolo uses Surf or Hydro Pump
- Similarly, rain abusers such as Keldeo, Toxicroak, Manaphy or even Heliosk love rain a lot and can have their power augmented thanks to Politoed.
- Electric-types can reliably use Thunder under Rain, putting much more offensive pressure on the opponent.
- Pokemon such as Latios and Kyurem-B who can handle Grass and Electric-types are useful teammates for Politoed.
- Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Landorus-T who appreciate Politoed's ability to switch into Water-type attacks.
- Anything that is weak to Fire immediately loves Politoed, due to rain neutralizing their Fire weakness. These include Scizor, Ferrothorn and Heracross.

Other Options
########

- Hydro Pump
- Rain Dance
- Damp Rock
- Focus Blast
- Ice Beam
- Hypnosis
- Psychic

Checks & Counters
########

- Amoonguss can redirect its moves, put it to sleep, hit it super effectively, and has Regenerator to shrug off the damage later.
- Opposing Ludicolo can easily switch abuse the free rain from Politoed and deal major damage with Giga Drain
- Thundurus, Zapdos, and Rotom-W can strike it with a Thunderbolt. Rotom-W also resists both of the moves commonly carried by Politoed, while Thundurus has Taunt to shut down Politoed's support moves.
- Jellicent completely walls most Politoed, as it's immune to Scald and takes very little from Ice Beams. Gastrodon is also in this category.
- Abomasnow doesn't mind Water-type attacks or whatever coverage Politoed commonly carries, and it has Giga Drain or Wood Hammer to deal a huge amount of damage to Politoed. Additionally, it can disrupt Politoed's rain by setting up its own hail.
- Opposing weather setters such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, Ninetales and Abomasnow are extremely annoying due to their own ability to set up their own weather.
- Taunt can nullify the majority of Politoed's movepool so care must be taken to avoid it.
