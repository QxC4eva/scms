<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The user is locked into this move and cannot make another move until it misses, 5 turns have passed, or the attack cannot be used. Power doubles with each successful hit of this move and doubles again if Defense Curl was used previously by the user. If this move is called by Sleep Talk, the move is used for one turn. After five turns have passed, or if the user fails to use the move successfully, the Base Power resets to 30.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rollout really does not have any use on anything except for, on occasion, Shuckle, a Pokemon who is already incredibly gimmicky. While Rollout can become a very powerful attack, it requires multiple turns to actually bring the Base Power of the attack up to a respectable level. The fact that Rollout can miss, sending it back to a 30 Base Power attack, makes it all the less worthwhile to actually use this move.</p>
