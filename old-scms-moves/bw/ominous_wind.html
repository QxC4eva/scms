<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to boost the user's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There isn't much competitive value for this move, thanks to the low PP and that a mere 10% chance of its effect activating ruins its only potential upside. The only time you may see this is when facing a Serene Grace user, but even then that means reserving an entire moveslot for this and crossing your fingers while waiting for a 20% chance to boost all stats by one stage. Not the brightest of ideas. Of course, it's male Combee's best coverage optionâ€¦ so that's something.</p>
