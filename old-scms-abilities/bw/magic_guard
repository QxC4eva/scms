<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder does not take damage except direct damage from attacks, damage from <a href="/bw/moves/pain split">Pain Split</a>, or self-damage from confusion, <a href="/bw/moves/belly_drum">Belly Drum</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/curse">Curse</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/struggle">Struggle</a>. Magic Guard does not prevent effects that cause the user to faint, such as <a href="/bw/moves/healing_wish">Healing Wish</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/perish_song">Perish Song</a>, or <a href="/bw/moves/memento">Memento</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>An amazing ability that can make a Pokemon ridiculously hard to kill. The main abuser is <a href="/bw/pokemon/reuniclus">Reuniclus</a>, who loves all the benefits from Magic Guard, such as the lack of Life Orb recoil, damage from weather, damage from status, meaning that combined with <a href="/bw/moves/recover">Recover</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/calm_mind">Calm Mind</a> it is almost impossible to kill. <a href="/bw/pokemon/sigilyph">Sigilyph</a> also enjoys it due to it now being immune to Stealth Rock, and being able to spread burn around with <a href="/bw/items/flame_orb">Flame Orb</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/psycho_shift">Psycho Shift</a>. <a href="/bw/pokemon/alakazam">Alakazam</a> is another colossal force with this ability, abusing recoil-free Life Orb attacks, negating its weakness to passive damage, and also enabling it to run <a href="/bw/items/focus_sash">Focus Sash</a> viably.</p>
