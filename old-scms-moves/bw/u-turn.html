Forces user to switch.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. After the user makes contact with the target, it immediately switches out. The player then selects and switches in a new Pokemon, who carries on the turn. Does not force the user to switch out if there are no more active Pokemon on the user's team, if U-turn KOes the target's last Pokemon, or if the target switched out using an Eject Button. If the move has no effect on the target Pokemon, then the secondary effect does not occur. If the foe uses Pursuit, then if the foe is faster, Pursuit deals normal damage, but if it is slower, Pursuit deals double damage. U-turn can be used to switch out of all trapping effects, including Ingrain, Mean Look, Shadow Tag, and Fire Spin.</p>

<p>In-game, if the user of U-turn KOes a trainer's Pokemon, then the next Pokemon sent in does not gain any experience points from that KO.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Such a cool move, which needs to be used intelligently to work to the fullest extent. In the DPP era with the rise of Scizor, this move became very well known, and for good reason. It has a healthy Base Power, which when combined with Scizor's vicious offensive ability becomes much more than a simple escape tool. It can be used as an effective scouting move, since it has a very real threat of serious damage behind it, and can often create mind games with the opponents. For example, if you use U-turn and the opponent switches on the same turn, it will give you the chance to act accordingly without wasting a turn switching.</p>

<p>It is also is worth noting that if you have a slower U-turn user, such as Celebi, this new one brought by the U-turn will enter the field unscathed. This gives you a better match-up, the obvious edge, and keeps the offensive pressure on your side. Another common strategy is to use a few strong U-turn users, such as Scizor or Landorus, in conjunction with Volt Switch users such as Rotom-W, who cover each other's weaknesses rather well, and by repeated use of both moves maintain pressure on the opponent for the duration of the battle.</p>

<p>As well as Scizor and other strong Bug-types, it's also a good move for Choice users, since they need to predict a lot by nature, and so having an easy way out to a more appropriate teammate when predicting an obvious switch from the opponent can help the team by a fair amount. A well-timed U-turn can maintain the offensive pressure on the user's side, something that's often lost when you predict wrongly with a Choice user otherwise. Finally, it's an easy way to escape from all trapping abilities, so Scizor isn't total Magnezone bait. Again, such a cool move.</p>
