<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The target is unable to use the same move twice in a row. This effect lasts until the target switches out. If the target can only use one move (ie. is holding a Choice item or locked by Encore) then the Pokemon must Struggle every other turn. Torment does not affect moves such as Outrage which repeat over several turns, and does not prevent the consecutive use of Struggle. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>When combined with Substitute and Protect, Torment can be an effective and agonizingly annoying attack. Torment is best used on a Pokemon whose Substitutes aren't easily broken, be it through natural bulk or thanks to a nice set of resistances. Ideally, set up a Substitute on a switch and use Torment on your opponent as it breaks the Substitute. From there, replace your Substitute or attack on the turns your opponent can't damage your Pokemon efficiently, and use Protect on their more powerful attack. The strategy's poster child and founding father is TormentTran, namely Heatran with the moves Torment, Substitute, Protect, and Lava Plume. A few other Pokemon can use the strategy effectively, but none have found as much success as Heatran has, thanks to its stellar array of resistances.</p>
