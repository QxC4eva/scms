<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 50% chance to lower the target's accuracy by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Not the most useful move, as the only users are Octillery and Kingdra, and both Pokemon have better things to do with that slot. The low Base Power is a big factor in explaining this move's lack of use, but not the only one. It simply doesn't hit hard enough and reducing the target's accuracy is not a reliable strategy. Most battlers would prefer to use a more powerful Water-type attack like Surf or Hydro Pump right from the start.</p>
