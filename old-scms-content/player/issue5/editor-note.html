		<p>Hello, readers!</p>
		
		<p>Welcome back, everybody. Issue #5 rolls up with a pretty varied lineup of articles - including a review of the latter stages of PSPL II, a teambuilder 101 and tips on how to win the Lobby. As per usual, they're all thanks to our contributors, who devoted hours of their precious time to turn varied jumbled thoughts into a finished product.</p>
		
		<p>Happy reading!</p>
