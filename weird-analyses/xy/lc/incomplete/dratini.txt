Overview
########

good attack
+2 priority in Espeed sets it apart
frail AF
like, seriously, this thing gets KOed by a gust of wind
fairies exist now, making Dratini less of a threat
slow, so can't really do much besides DD or spam Draco Meteor on walls
Needs Espeed to be effective, so must either be fully physical or mixed
+1 Outrage at least 2HKOs everything non-resisting it
still good poke


Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Extremespeed
move 4: Iron Tail / Fire Blast
ability: Shed Skin
item: Life Orb
evs: 244 Atk / 36 SpD / 196 Spe
ivs: 0 HP
nature: Adamant / Lonely

Moves
========
DD sets up to sweep, is a freaking sweet move
Outrage is super strong STAB to OHKO a lot after +1
Espeed gives priority to revenge kill without a boost or kill Choice Scarfers with one
Iron Tail hits Fairies, OHKOing even the great Spritzee at +1 after one round of SR and Spikes
However, it is freaking Iron Tail, so Fire Blast serves to hit Steels harder (although the most common one can just Sucker Punch for the KO)

Set Details
========

evs to get most power and tie the glorious 21 Speed tier after a DD with the rest to gain an extra point in SpD
HP ivs are 0 to make LO recoil take 1 HP instead of 2
Adamant gets Dratini the most power, but Lonely is an option if opting for Fire Blast
Shed Skin rids Dratini of pesky burns and paralyses

Usage Tips
========
a good sweeper
needs some hefty defensive team support to set up
gets wrecked by main Fake Out users (since it goes before Espeed), like Aipom, Mienfoo, and Meditite, so clear those out before attempting a sweep
be careful of spamming Outrage since a Fairy might come in and set up all over you
can punch holes for another to sweep or can clean up late game

Team Options
========
is super frail, so needs some Encore support or Screen support
Wynaut is super freaking awesome since Berry Juice isn't banned yet (like for real; I've been getting at least one, maybe two or three KOs with Wynaut by itself)
Cottonee gets priority Encore
Bronzor sets up screens well
Mixed Murkrow punches solid holes for Dratini to clean up
Timburr takes on Pawniard and other steels but is also walled by Fairies
Magnemite traps Steels and scares Fairies with Flash Cannon
Dwebble sets up SR and Spikes to net important KOs (such as the aforementioned Spritzee)
other 1-turn set up sweepers like Shellder and Tirtouga can come in and frolic with walls like Spritzee gone


Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Extremespeed
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Iron Tail
ability: Shed Skin
item: Life Orb
evs: 164 Atk / 196 SpA / 120 Spe
ivs: 0 HP
nature: Rash

Moves
========
Dratini has a strong Draco Meteor and has the stats to use it and physical moves
Espeed has +2 priority I CANNOT STRESS HOW USEFUL THIS IS and it still hits hard off 15 Atk
Fire Blast roasts Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Foongus
Iron Tail hits Fairies expecting an Outrage or Draco Meteor or whatever Dratini wants to do
2HKOs standard Spritzee

Set Details
========
EVs to get as much Atk and SpA as possible while still outspeeding most walls (though still not Chinchou)
Rash nature to get the most out of Draco Meteor while still keeping up the strength of Espeed and Iron Tail
0 HP ivs makes LO recoil be 1 point instead of 2
Shed Skin rids Dratini of troublesome burns or Paralysis
LO powers both sides of the attacking spectrum

Usage Tips
========
mostly spam Draco Meteor unless predicting a Steel or Fairy to come in
if these happen, use the appropriate move to OHKO or 2HKO
can also function as a revenge killer through Espeed
I can't think of anything to say in here

Team Options
========
needs hazards support to get some notable KOs, like to guarantee the 2HKO on Spritzee and Vullaby and Draco + Espeed on Chinchou
Dwebble is good at this, also Omanyte
can lead the way for sweepers
Tirtouga, Shellder, Scraggy, Pawniard are examples
can't OHKO faster things with Espeed, so needs chip damage and a free switch in since it's so frail
Magnemite resists Fairy and Ice and can Volt Switch Dratini in
Mienfoo scares Ice-types and can bait Fairies for Dratini to crack with Iron Tail, and Mienfoo has a slow U-Turn to get Dratini in safely

Other Options
########
T-wave and Dragon Tail, but generally too frail and outclassed
good special movepool, but Dratini needs Espeed, and the mixed attacker set has it best
ResTalk + DD + Outrage worked before, but now Fairies are immune to Dragon, and Steel types still exist. Also, this is setup bait
Waterfall or Aqua Tail, but no real extra coverage or KOs gained
Agility is interesting, but DD is better
Choice Band could work to try and just muscle through walls instead of covering them
Aqua Jet, but Espeed is stronger and has good neutral coverage anyway


Checks & Counters
########
Fairies, but if packing Iron Tail, watch out
Steels, but if packing Fire Blast, watch out
Spritzee with full health can live Iron Tail and KO with Moonblast
Pawniard can Sucker Punch before Fire Blast, but an interesting game with Extremespeed can be played to dodge Sucker Punch
fast scarfers who are immune to or resist Espeed
gastly, misdreavus, amaura
Fake Out beats out Espeed, and Dratini is so frail, it'll likely KO
Sturdy means no OHKO which Dratini relies on to avoid taking damage
