Has a high critical hit rate.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a critical hit rate one stage higher than normal. Assuming there are no other critical hit modifiers in play, this move has a 1/8 chance to get a critical hit instead of a 1/16 chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Slash is not a very good move. Even with a higher critical hit ratio than normal, Return outdamages Slash an overwhelming majority of the time, so Return should always be used over Slash.</p>
