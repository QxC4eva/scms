<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Confuses the target and boosts the target's Attack by two stages. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Swagger is a high-risk, high-reward attack that, for the most part, should be avoided. The chance of your opponent knocking itself out from boosted confusion damage sounds alluring (and hilarious), but if confusion doesn't work in your favor, you could find yourself in a problematic situation. Most walls have other methods of annoying opponents, so stick with one of them. On a minor note, a strategy of using Swagger on one of your own Pokemon equipped with a Persim or Lum Berry in doubles isn't completely unheard of.</p>
