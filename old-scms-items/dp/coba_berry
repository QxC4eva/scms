<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Flying-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed during the damage calculation. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 Base Power Flying-type attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Coba Berry is a type-resist Berry that weakens the power of super effective Flying-type moves. While this may sound like a boon to certain Pokemon, particularly Breloom and Heracross, it becomes less so when it's made apparant that Flying-type moves are rarely seen in OU play. In most cases, the two aforementioned Pokemon will make much better use of other items, such as Toxic Orb for the former and Choice Scarf for the latter. What's more, the main use of Coba Berry is to ensure that both Pokemon survive a Flying-type attack to set up and then proceed to sweep, a strategy both Pokemon find very hard to accomplish even after the setup.</p>
