[SHORT DESC]
All Water-type attacks hit this Pokémon. 
[LONG DESC]
<p>All Water-type attacks, even those from your ally in 2v2, hit this Pokémon with 100% accuracy, regardless of the intended target. If a Pokemon with Storm Drain and a Pokemon using Follow Me are out at the same time, and a Pokemon uses a Water-type attack targeted at the Follow Me user's team, Follow Me will take precedence and absorb the attack. Hidden Power is never attracted by Storm Drain, even if Hidden Power is Water.</p>
