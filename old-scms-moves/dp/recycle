[SHORT DESC]
Restores a used item.

[LONG DESC]
<p>The user obtains the last item consumed by a Pokémon in the user's position. This could be the user's item, but could also be an item used by another Pokémon on the user's team. Items lost to Fling, Natural Gift, Bug Bite, or Pluck can be restored in this way. In each case, the item can be recycled by a Pokémon occupying the position of the item's original bearer. If the user is already holding an item, this move fails. If this move successfully recycles an item, the item must be consumed again before it can be recycled again. This move cannot restore items lost to Covet, Knock Off, Switcheroo, Thief, or Trick.
