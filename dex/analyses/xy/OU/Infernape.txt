Moves
========
- Close Combat and Flare Blitz are strong STABs with good coverage.
- Flare Blitz has more power, while Fire Blast is an option if you don't like recoil, and want to do more damage to physically defensive stuff like Skarmory or Forretress.
- Fire Blast also 2HKOs Landorus-T and Gliscor after Stealth Rock.
- HP Ice is useful for Landorus-T, and also hits Garchomp, Dragonite, and Gliscor the hardest.
- Super effective Thunder Punch with Iron Fist boost hits marginally harder than neutral STAB. Targets include Gyarados before Mega Evolving, Jellicent, Starmie, and Tentacruel, while being best move for Mandibuzz and Keldeo.
- U-turn allows Infernape to scout switch-ins and offers a lot of utility.
- Mach Punch can revenge kill threats like +1 Mega Gyarados, +1 Mega Tyranitar, and Swords Dance Bisharp, while preventing a Speed tie with Terrakion and other base 108 Speed Pokemon.
Hidden Power Grass is an option for Rotom-W, and Grass Knot hits other Water-types and Hippowdon.

Set Details
========
- Flare Blitz guarantees a 2HKO on Mega-Venasaur after Stealth Rock damage, while Fire Blast doesn't.
- 44 SpA EVs guaratees the OHKO on Gliscor, Landorus, and Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage.
- 44 SpA Evs also allow Infernape to 2HKO Gliscor and Landorus-T after Stealth Rock, allowing space for Thunder Punch and U-turn or Mach Punch, making Infernape harder to wall and giving it more utility.
- Iron Fist boosts Mach Punch and Thunder Punch, but Blaze gives a strong finishing Fire-type move if you're not running Mach Punch or Thunder Punch.
- Max Speed is mandatory to Speed tie other base 108 Speed Pokemon like Terrakion and outspeed Pokemon like Garchomp and positive nature base 100 Speed Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========
- Nice coverage and Speed tier allow Infernape to threaten and KO a handful of stuff, but it is mostly outclassed by Keldeo.
- Advantages of using Infernape include access to U-turn and Mach Punch, giving Infernape a lot more utility. Infernape also has no trouble with Grass-types.
- Recoil makes it easily worn down by passive damage, especially with Flare Blitz.

Team Options
========
- Sun boosts the power of Infernape's Fire-type attacks; Mega Charizard Y can set up sun with Drought.
- Rotom-W resists three of Infernape's weaknesses and switches into Talonflame, Azumarill, and Mega Pinsir, who threaten Infernape with super effective priority.
- Substitute Kyurem-B with Fusion Bolt and Thundurus can deal with bulky Water-types, especially Rotom-W, that Infernape struggles with.
- Late-game sweepers like Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Swords Dance Garchomp appreciate Infernape wearing down their checks.

Other Options
########
- Choice Band
- Swords Dance
- Choice Scarf
- Nasty Plot


Checks & Counters
########
- Mega Charizard X, specifically bulky variants. Mega Charizard Y also checks Infernape if it doesn't carry Thunder Punch.
- Hippowdon, but it takes a good chunk of damage from Grass Knot.
- Rotom-W, but it must be wary of Hidden Power Grass.
- Mixed walls: Sylveon, Clefable.
- Talonflame, Azumarill and Mega Pinsir pack super effective priority, while the former two resist both STABs.
- Latias, Latios, Thundurus, Talonflame, Deoxys-S, Starmie, and Gengar all outspeed Infernape, resist Mach Punch and OHKO.
- Bulky Water-types such as Jellicent, Gyarados, Tentacruel, and Slowbro check Infernape but dislike Thunder Punch.
