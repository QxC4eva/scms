<div class="aside">

<p>I suddenly wake up from a strange dream one cloudy afternoon on Thursday. The anxiety I've got from my last interview must have done some voodoo upon me, but because I'm a strong, independent woman who don't need no man, I shake the curse off and walk outside into the vast gray. A beautiful, rainbow bird, with what appears to be mail in its talons, swoops down in front of me and squawks loudly into my face. It drops the letter and, before flying off, poops on the sidewalk with utmost pleasure.</p>

<p>I quickly open the mail and... slightly rip the letter in half on accident. That usually happens when I do things too fast. But, now the middle section looks like Arabian Chinese with a twist of Japanese or something. I look at the backside and notice a very shady Treecko, with a button that says "Push to Teleport" on the bottom right side. Is this magic? If so, then I don't need to order an airplane (secret agents still think I suck)! Out of curiosity, I press the button and everything immediately goes blank.</p>

<p>Upon my second awakening, I appear to be lying down on a coach in a odd house. I check my finger to see what happened to it, and apparently it's a little green, whatever that means. A man comes out from a room and says a jumble of words. I figure one of them out to be "Treecko." And then, I hear "excited" and "interview." Oh, I know where this is going.</p>

</div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Hello, Treecko! It seems it was only a little over a year ago that you were just some guy called Treecko37. Now that you've spread your name across the Smogon interwebz, I think it's time that everyone got to know who you are! Who's the person behind this particular Hoenn Grass starter Pok&eacute;mon? Occupation, college, location, age, all that good stuff.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>My occupation is currently bum. Within the past six months, I've had a lot of family issues that I've needed to sort out, preventing me from working/going to school, but they've been mostly handled. I'm looking for a new job right now (if anyone is hiring, lmk...). And I'm a 21-year-old guy from Illinois.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>That's a bummer about the issues. I'm glad they are being taken care of, though! Before we get into Smogon and Pok&eacute;mon, let's talk more about the real you. What kind of hobbies do you have? Are you that outgoing guy who everyone likes, has a girlfriend, does a million sports, or are you the nerd who sits in the back row and people make fun of (okay, hopefully not in a bad way!)? Maaaybe you're just some average person in an average world?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>I'm a pretty outgoing guy. I go out a lot (and drink vodka like it's water). I like to chill and listen to music. I used to write a lot, but I haven't done as much lately. I do still write from time to time, though. I actually don't play video games much outside of Pok&eacute;mon because most of my free time is spent just hanging out with friends.</p></div>

<div class="aside">
  <p>He takes a deep breath. I patiently wait in silence.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>None of this is to say that people never made fun of me, though. I was pretty quiet as a kid, and I came out to everyone I knew as gay when I was 14, which led to a lot of backlash because I grew up in a small town. But, I grew to embrace it at a relatively young age, and I'd be lying if I said none of that shaped me into the person I am today.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>A circle of friends is always nice. :) What do you guys do? Movies, parties, concerts maybe, all that usual stuff?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>We mostly just find our own ways to have fun. We go out to parties and bars and stuff pretty frequently, but mostly we just bum around. Sometimes we go out to concerts (a friend of mine is in a band, so it's easy to find cheap local shows to go to), sometimes we just drive around and blast music in the car. Usually, it depends on the size of our wallets at the time.</p></div>

<div class="aside">
  <p>I suddenly feel the urge to check out my wallet. I have nothing.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>You seem to like adventure then! Do you want to go anywhere/have been to a certain place outside your area? Like, travel to Australia, England, western USA, etc?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>ugh yes. I've always wanted to go to Australia because Illinois is stupidly cold in the winter, and it'd be so nice to not have to deal with -50 degree weather (I kid you not, we got down to -50 with the windchill here a few weeks ago). I'd love to travel pretty much anywhere, though, just for the sake of traveling and seeing the world. As for places I've been, I've managed to find my way to most of the eastern US barring New York. My grandma used to live in so I've been all over southeastern US, and I've gone to Dayton Ohio, Indianapolis, Washington D.C., Memphis, and a few places in Kentucky on vacations/school trips etc.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>I cannot imagine being in such weather, being a Californian. Okay, let's move on. What attracted you to Smogon in the first place? Was it the analyses, you wanting to get tutored, or something completely different from the common attractions?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>I actually started out on PO some time before I came to Smogon. I knew Smogon was a thing, but I actually wanted to start to get involved around the same time when the Smogon PO server was constantly crashing and ended up going to PO Main instead because I couldn't connect. From there, I just figured I'd stay with PO because I got to know a lot of people and really enjoyed it there.</p>

<p>Eventually, most of my friends from PO quit, and I hadn't moved up on the site at all. I'd been going to PS! at this point from time to time when I was drunk so that I could play randbats, and then I found out about the randbats voice challenge, got voice, decided to make the switch, and the rest is history. Basically, if drunken randbats wasn't a thing, I might still be on PO.</p></div>

<div class="aside">
  <p>I make a note to myself: "get drunk, play randbats, obtain ultimate power." Sounds good.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>I see. That's quite interesting to hear! What's the story about your journey throughout Smogon? How did you get your badges and become pretty well-known?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>Oh god. Uh, well, like I said, I started out as a simple voice on PS!. Eventually, PS! staff noticed me, and I got promoted to driver. At this point I was posting a bit in the NU subforums as well because NU was the metagame I played the most on PO. About a month after that, I was promoted to mods on PS! and earned my first badge, but I can't for the life of me remember when that was. Some time passed, and I kept doing my thing and got CC for my posting in the NU subforum.</p>

<p>After that, I kind of just immersed myself all over the site. This was about when my previously mentioned family issues came about, and I'd just moved back to my hometown after living on my own for about three years, so it was a pretty rough time for me. I spent most of my free time on Smogon (AND WITH MY DOG) because most of my friends from the area had moved on and gone to college (as had I up until that point). So I got really involved with the site, got IRC AOps and some other badges. Then I got my first mod position from Raseri in NU C&amp;C alongside ebeast, and we whipped the subforum into shape for a good while.</p>

<p>I got mods all over after that in places I can't even remember as well as SOps on IRC and leaders on PS!, and apparently people noticed because I was appointed to smods about a month or two ago. Sounds pretty tacky, but I had Smogon to fill in while I rebuilt relationships with old friends and got back on my feet. It's pretty cool though, because now that I've done/am doing that, I've still got Smogon, and I can help out without dedicating so much time to everything, only this time in a more advisory role, which is the kind of position I like to be in. Not to say that I don't still do stuff, but most of the stuff I do these days is behind-the-scenes rather than in the forefront.</p></div>

<div class="aside">
  <p>I stretched out my arms into the air as if we had just finished a movie. I'm not sure how much of that I paid attention to.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>You moderate a lot of areas! (Well, I mean you can moderate essentially everything with supermod powers, but you have your own selection of areas that you were appointed to moderating in the first place.) What's your favorite place to moderate and why?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>Uhh, probably Other Metas. I was never ~officially~ nommed for OM mods, but when I was given OU mods, it gave me full UT mods, and when they fixed the permissions to make it so I only modded OU, Arcticblast told me I could go ahead and stay on as an OM mod. Modding OM is chill because you get to see all the different ideas people have for metagames and help them develop them into something that people will really enjoy playing. Plus, I get to work with Arcticblast, and we get along famously. DTC, The Immortal, and Joim (honorary mention to Ace Emerald) too, I guess, but they smell kinda funny. Shoutouts to Mentorship Program too. I'd have picked it, but it's a pretty low-maintenance forum, so there's not a lot of actual moderating.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>lol! I like how that all worked out. Is there anything you'd like to see improved in certain forums/systems on Smogon? It doesn't have to be what you normally moderate, but I'm thinking it will be along those lines. Like Suggestion Box (jk), anything about Mentorship, and/or NU?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>Yeah, everywhere on the site pretty much could use some improving, but that just boils down to how much work the players want to put into making those places better. As a QC member in BW NU and XY LC and a contributor in those places as well as OU C&amp;C, I wish it was a lot more lax than it is. Specifically, I don't like how much the QC and GP processes deter some people from contributing to analyses and such, but I realize with the large userbase that we've got, it's a pretty necessary evil.</p></div>

<div class="aside">
  <p>Upon every light is a shadow...</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>I definitely agree and wish that C&amp;C was more lax. That's one of the reasons I stopped contributing to it (I mean, the site needs to get work done; I'll just let the people who don't mind the process do it). Anyway, you appear to play many metagames, ranging from NU to LC to OU. What makes you want to play all these metagames? Do you enjoy playing in different environments everyday; maybe you play one metagame today, another the next day or something?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>That's pretty much it, yeah. I stopped playing NU for a while back towards the end of BW because it was getting boring and Scolipede was ruining the metagame, but we thankfully banned it recently, so I've been toying around with it a bit again. I just got into OU and LC (and when it came around, UU) when XY started, as they were fresh metas and I really wanted to use Bunnelby because it is incredibly adorable. And now I play them pretty much whenever I feel like it. Usually I get burnt out on one for a while and then pick up another when I want to try something new.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Bunnies are adorable. :3 So I'm just going to shoot this one at your face. What do you like about competitive Pok&eacute;mon and do you think you'll be continuing to play competitive Pok&eacute;mon in the future? Do you have any competitive goals, like wanting to obtain a trophy?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>Competitive Pok&eacute;mon is just something I enjoy playing around with in my free time more than anything else. For a while, I wanted to get really great at the game and maybe win a trophy or something, but I don't care so much about that anymore. Now I just want to use fun sets and teams and just play to have fun. I still participate in tournaments from time to time, but I try not to put too much pressure on myself when I do because that's when I stop having fun. I'll definitely keep playing the game until I lose interest, which could be a few months down the line or even a few years. Who knows?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>That's great to hear; you're playing the game for fun and not for complete glory. Anyway, you are a Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! administrator. What do you do on PS! as an administrator besides the regular moderator chores?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>Nothing extra special that the other leaders/admins don't do, but I handle policy stuff, promotions and demotions, room suggestions and other room issues, weigh in on various issues when I'm needed, and help with some clerical work for Zarel on occasion. A lot of what I do is stuff that's never seen, so it's kind of hard to answer that question without spilling things haha.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Okay, that's fine with me. Some things are better kept secret. The rest of the questions will be generally "just for fun." What's your favorite food? Describe it in detail if it's kinda obscure.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>I honestly don't love food that much, and most of my favorite foods are boring, but my absolute favorite would be a tie between tomatoes and blueberries. Like pretty much anything with those is guaranteed to be good in my book.</p></div>

<div class="aside">
  <p>I jump up and applaud my interviewee for one of my 1,000 correct answers to the question.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>BLUEBERRIES! You, good sir, have just won the internet! Next one up, what's your favorite Pok&eacute;mon game?</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>Any of RSE. It's funny because my favorite Pok&eacute;mon isn't even Treecko, and it's honestly not even in my top five favorite Pok&eacute;mon. But I love gen 3 so much, and Treecko is by far the best starter in RSE which I guess is where the inspiration for the username comes from lol. But yeah, I played the shit out of Sapphire and Emerald when I was in like 6th grade, I think, because I loved almost all of the new Pok&eacute;mon, the storyline, the legends (barring Zapdos, Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza are the coolest legends), the starters, and your rival. It was the perfect set of games, and I'm among those who desperately want a remake soon. :(</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>Well then, you just answered a part of this question with that response haha! Yeah, the third generation is definitely some of my favorite Pok&eacute;mon games as well. Anyway, Bunnelby is currently your favorite Pok&eacute;mon. Will you eventually steal user: Bunnelby's name and use it for yourself???</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>ugh I blame senior staff for me not having Bunnelby now. I asked Hugendugen to change my username for me, and he wouldn't. Then, I asked chaos, and he was like, "nigga no one's gonna call you that." And, I asked a couple other people, and no one would do it for me. Then, by the time I could change it myself, I figured I probably should just stay as Treecko now. Still, if you ever see that user as "Bunnelby." then you should probably check to see if I'm still Treecko or not.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker flora"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_flora.png" alt="Flora" /><p>lol alrighty! Thanks a lot, Treecko, and hope you have a nice night! It was very awesome to interview you!</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker treecko"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue33/interview_treecko.png" alt="Treecko" /><p>Thanks!! It's been fun. Shoutout to Sephirona for the sick avatar.</p></div>

<div class="aside">
  <p>He gets up and immediately hops back to his PC to battle some nooblords and whatnot. I wish him good luck and have fun in all his battles and take my leave into a dark, cold, and snowy night. I've learned a lot of facts today: Treecko isn't a Treecko, he's a bum, and we're more alike than we think. Well, the last part is a sort of, kind of thing, but yeah! Wait a second, how am I getting back home? In the distance, I see a car with its keys in place and doors unlocked. I don't know how to drive yet, but I do know what I need to do.</p>
