<h2>What is PU?</h2>
<p>Welcome to PU! PU is the tier under Neverused, filled to the brim with all of the discarded Pok&eacute;mon that no other tier has any use or want for. Unlike the name of other tiers, such as OU (Overused), UU (Underused), and RU (Rarelyused), PU doesn't stand for anything. The tier is named "PU" because all of the Pok&eacute;mon in the tier stink more than Skuntank's Defog! In PU, these Pok&eacute;mon can find a place to shine despite their near-uselessness in other tiers.</p>

<h2>Threats</h2>
<p>Good threats in PU are hard to come by; finding an attacker which can break through the bulk of the Eviolite users in the tier is difficult, and finding one which suits your needs and team makes the pool of candidates even shallower. Nevertheless, the large population of the PU tier gives you good options and choices whilst still allowing teams to be diverse and not over centralised. Some strong powerhouses in the tier include:</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/golem.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Golem</strong> @ Weakness Policy<br />
Ability: Sturdy</br>
EVs: 12 HP / 252 Atk / 244 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Rock Polish<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
</p>

<p>Here is Golem. It's probably not what you expected to see in  "Threats",  but this set works really well if, like most of the Pok&eacute;mon under this category, it is played correctly. With this set, you want to take advantage of your ability to survive any one hit as long as you're at 100% HP. Couple this with a Weakness Policy and you have yourself an extremely dangerous threat. Rock Polish allows it to outspeed positive-natured Pok&eacute;mons with base 120 Speed , making it a real danger to the enemy. This set is really hurt by a physically defensive Roar/Whirlwind users, as Golem might not be able to OHKO them, resulting in it losing its stat boosts and wasting Sturdy, so it's a good idea to take them out before bringing in Golem. It also cannot touch Serperior, as its just too bulky and eats up all of Golem's hits, even when it's at +2!<br />
Another set for Golem is to replace Rock Polish with Stealth Rock, and change its item for leftovers. Also changing the Evs for a more bulky set, investing in HP and Def allows it to be a physically bulky rock setter. Sucker Punch allows it to revenge kill Psychic types if needed and its 2 STAB attacks allow it to do damage to threats such as Garbador and Sycther.</p>




<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/sneasel.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Sneasel</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Inner Focus<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Knock Off<br />
- Ice Shard<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Low Kick<br />
</p>


<p>The reasons why Sneasel is so good in PU are its immunity to Stored Power and its powerful STAB attacks PU is full of Eviolite users, so STAB Knock Off is nicevery useful, as it hits everything for large amounts of damage and gets rid of their item. Ice Punch is for dealing with pesky Flying-types; the ability to outspeed and OHKO Chatot is a valuable asset to any PU team.</p>


<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/haunter.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Haunter</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Trick<br />
- Sludge Bomb<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
</p>
<div class="float-right"><img src="/player/issue4/haunter.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Haunter is a heavy-hitting special attacker. With a huge Special Attack stat, its STAB attacks are hard to take. This set is a Choice Scarf Trick set, which works amazingly well, especially in PU, because, as mentioned before, there are a lot of Eviolite users. Tricking the Choice Scarf onto Eviolite carriers is especially useful for Haunter, as it can make use of the defensive boosts without losing too much in exchange. Its Speed stat is already respectable without the Choice Scarf, and not too much in the tier can out speed it without boosts. Sludge Bomb is very threatning to Fairy-types, which not much else can hit hard, as there aren't too many Steel-types in PU,so being locked into Sludge Bomb has almost no downsides. Shadow Ball , on the other hand, is absorbed by the many Normal -types that populate PU, and the fact that it is not as powerful as Sludge Bomb leads to Shadow Ball only being used when attacking a Psychic- or fellow Ghost -type Pok&eacute;mon or when Sludge Bomb is resisted. Thunderbolt allows Haunter to hit threats such as Carracosta and Scyther for potential 2HKO's.</p>



<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/chatot.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Chatot</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Keen Eye<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Boomburst<br />
- Chatter<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Encore / Nasty Plot<br />
</p>


<p>Chatot is a big threat in PU, as it can deal huge amounts of damage with its Life Orb-boosted STAB Boomburst, completely breaking through the defenses of the special walls such as Clefairy, Throh, and Togetic that might try to take the hit, leaving them to be 2HKOed or 3HKOed more easily. Chatter is another really nice move. Unique to Chatot, it guarantees inducing confusion on the opponent, especially nice if you're a hax -reliant player like all the people at the top of the ladder! (no salt, honest).! While it does not deal as much damage as Boomburst does, the possibility of the opponent hitting itself due to confusion gives Chatter a niche place on the move set. The next 2 moves are interchangeable and depend on how you want to play your Chatot: Substitute is for those of you who want to get those 2HKO's without getting hurt in return, with the safety of Substitute keeping you as healthy as possible. Encore aids this as you can Encore the opponent into an unfavourable move and then freely set up a Substitute as they repeat the move or switch out. Nasty Plot is the alternative option, as despite having an amazing move in Boomburst, Chatot's base Special Attack stat isn't that high, and so boosting it with Nasty Plot really helps to increase its damage.</p>




<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/carracosta.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Carracosta</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Solid Rock<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Shell Smash<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Aqua Jet<br />

<p>Carracosta is currently one of the best sweepers in PU. A base 108 Attack boosted by Shell Smash is not something to mess around with. It can break walls with its powerful dual STAB attacks and secure KO's on weakened targets with its STAB priority move, Aqua Jet. Before using Shell Smash, Carracosta has nice bulk, with a respectable base 133 Defense. Accompanied by its ability, "Solid Rock", which reduces the damage of all super effective moves by 25%, it can take a lot of common attacks such as Earthquake. On the other hand, after it sets up its Shell Smash, it really doesn't want to take any hits. Big threats to Carracosta include Serperior and Torterra, which it can't touch at all and is easily OHKOed by Giga Drain and Wood Hammer, respectively.</p>



<img src="/dex/media/sprites/xy/frogadier.gif" alt="" />
<p><strong>Frogadier</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Protean<br />
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Naive Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Dark Pulse<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
</p>

<p>Much like Greninja, Frogadier is a huge specially offensive threat. With Protean making all of its moves get a STAB bonus along with an extra damage boost from Life Orb, Frogadier's attacks can heavily damage the bulkiest of walls in PU. Frogadier's respectable base 97 Speed allows it out speed a lot of the meta game, securing KOs before U-turning out to keep offensive momentum. Hydro Pump allows Frogadier to hit almost everything hard. Ice Beam has great coverage against Pok&eacute;mon such as Torterra, Altaria, and other Ground-, Dragon-, Grass and Flying -types. Dark Pulse provides coverage against Psychic- and Ghost -types. This set is walled by bulky Fairy -types, such as Clefairy and Togetic , however, as they resist two of Frogadier's attacks and have great special bulk and recovery which allow them to live Frogadier's hits and recover their health back , eventually forcing Frogadier to switch/U-turn or stalling Frogadier out via Life Orb recoil.</p>

<h2>Why was the PU room added?</h2>

<p>The primary reason PU was added as a room was due to its popularity and wide playerbase. At first, only a PU ladder was up, but this eventually grew into the room. PU actually had more battles in October than NU , an official metagame. This meant that PU had a much more active ladder than an official metagame with its own room. People decided that the room would be a great addition to discuss the rapidly growing metagame. Not many people really disagreed with the addition of the room, so it was added!</p>

  <h2>What goes on in the room?</h2>

<p>Well, we talk about PU! We discuss the metagame itself and potential suspects, and we share with each other our own different Pok&eacute;mon we've discovered. There's usually a fantastic discussion going about various threats! The room is not just a random moshpit, though -- we actually do have intelligent discussions. The atmosphere of the room is very nice in general, with a generally friendly user base. The room is now public and running functionally -- come chat with us here! If you're looking to become integrated with the room, don't be shy, just start talking about PU and you'll do fine! The PU room is also bustling with tours quite often. These tours are nearly always PU tours, with an occasional oddball thrown in. During the tours, discussion is quite high and many players share battling strategies! This is a wonderful time to come to the room and is usually when the room is at its most active. These tournaments occur frequently, and if you miss one, you'll likely be able to join the following one in a short time.</p>

  <h2>Other info</h2>

<p>The room is public, so anyone is free to join and contribute. We'd love to see you come and chat with us. The best cure to not knowing people and not feeling like a part of the community is talking, so please get involved! There are regular tournaments in the room (nearly always PU), and they really brighten up the chat while they're running. As the room is a new one, there's a simple initial staff structure - the tier leaders (Detective Dell and WhiteDMist) are room Owners, while council members are room Moderators. If you'd like to become a part of the staff, just remember that being a constantly good chat presence is the best way to get promoted!</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>PU is an extremely fun tier where previously underwhelming Pok&amp;eacute;mon can become powerful threats in their own rights. XY PU, being new to the simulator, gives an opportunity for lots of new sets and strategies to come to light. The newly added PU room Pok&eacute;mon is a great place to find PU battles, get advice from some of the best PU players and discuss the meta!</p>
