<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Me and my mom arrived at the King of Prussia mall. While walking in, I saw a little kid with a Munchlax hat with his mom. They told us to go down the nearest escalator. We walked through JC Penney for a bit, then once we reached the escalator, there it was in sight-the convention. They told us we didn't have to turn in the contract and registration number yet, until 1 PM. I got a Pokemon Video Game Nationals T-shirt with the shadow of Mewtwo and Rayquaza.</p>

<p>So we just walked around. I asked where the line was to get Celebi. A line of about 16 people was nearby. I asked, "Is this where the line starts?" No. I had to keep going back until I saw the line was near Foot Locker. Just fucking great. I saw a fat person trying to dress like Jessie from Team Rocket on the show, and another guy in a Munchlax costume. About a third of the way into the line, I realized I missed a call from my mom, so I called back and told her where I was. She agreed to get me some food from Burger King (a Double Bacon Cheeseburger value meal).</p>

<p>While I was still in line, I got my food around 12:35. I didn't want to get my GBA SP greased, so I ate my fries and bacon cheeseburger as fast as I could. I cleaned my hands off with a napkin. After finally making it through the line, I went up, and got a Gentle Celebi. I went to the bathroom real quickly, and found the line for the tourney registration.</p>

<p>As I knew, the brackets were made in the order of how the participants signed up. That's where I fucked up, because TTS (Talking Toilet Seat from Smogon) was like the third person after me. I met with him about 3/4 of the way through the line. I told him who I was, and got back in line. At the time he said he hasn't seen Justin or BLJ yet. At about 1:25, I got to the registration. I turned in the signed contract and the registration number. I'm ready to pawn like dog!</p>

<p>However, the tournament wasn't going to start until 2 PM. No problem, we still have time to browse around. My dad got here. He and my mom wanted to go see the resturaunt my sister works at, the Zodiac. I met with her, and she talked with my parents for a few minutes. We then headed back down so I could play. At about 1:50 PM, we got back to the convention. We were soon going to be called to start playing. I met with Justin Hill, who I found out was <a href="/forums/member.php?u=217">Justin8649</a> from Smogon. I recognized him because of his shirt with a Koffing on it. I got out my GBA SP, and was nervous.</p>

<h2>My Team</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adrenaline (Rayquaza)</li>
<li>Jesus (Mewtwo)</li>
<li>Force (Kyogre)</li>
<li>Greed (Smeargle) (didn't use)</li>
<li>Slasher (Persian) (didn't use)</li>
<li>Micronomy (Metagross)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Battling</h2>
<p>At the last minute, I decided I wanted to try skarm's plan with Smeargle, but since I didn't have a GameCube, I had to use a not as durable boomer, Metagross. Anyways, Round 1. I was against...</p>

<h3>Round 1: freaktron vs Alex Stevenson</h3>

<h4>His Team</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="/rs/pokemon/mewtwo">Mewtwo</a></li>
<li><a href="/rs/pokemon/kyogre">Kyogre</a></li>
<li><a href="/rs/pokemon/rayquaza">Rayquaza</a></li>
<li><a href="/rs/pokemon/latios">Latios</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>My Team</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="/rs/pokemon/mewtwo">Mewtwo</a></li>
<li><a href="/rs/pokemon/metagross">Metagross</a></li>
<li><a href="/rs/pokemon/rayquaza">Rayquaza</a></li>
<li><a href="/rs/pokemon/kyogre">Kyogre</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Turn 1</h4>
<pre>My Mewtwo uses Protect.
His Mewtwo Shadow Balls my Metagross for about 22%.

Kyogre Thunders Metagross getting it into the red, and paralyzing it.
Luckily, Metagross manages to explode, killing both Kyogre and his Mewtwo.</pre>

Alex brings in Rayquaza and Latios.
I bring in Rayquaza.

<h4>Turn 2:</h4>
<pre>My Rayquaza uses Protect.
Mewtwo Ice Beams his Rayquaza, killing it.
Latios tries to Ice Beam my Rayquaza, but it is warded off with Protect.</pre>

<h4>Turn 3:</h4>
<pre>Rayquaza Extremespeeds Latios to just over 50%.
Mewtwo finishes it with Ice Beam.</pre>

<p>Final Score: 3-0, me. I'm just glad I got away with 1 win.</p>

<p>We had to wait for almost an hour for everyone in Group 1 THEN Group 2 to finish. So I saw a laptop, and was able to look at Smogon. I was worried still. Remember how I said the brackets are being put in the order of registration? And TTS was like the third person after me? Well that's bad news for me. I knew I should've gone back in line. Because in Round 2, he's who I was against.</p>

<h3>Round 2: freaktron vs Danny "Asuka/TTS/Talking Toilet Seat" Zollner</h3>

<p>He used: Snorlax, Mewtwo, Kyogre, ???(all I recall was that he had a Rayquaza, Groudon and Shiftry)
I used: Rayquaza, Metagross, Mewtwo, Kyogre</p>

<p>At first, my connection went awry at first so we had to start over. I looked at his team, and was too afraid to use Obi mode. But I really should've used it. I REALLY played like shit this time. I had no idea what I was doing. I was way too hasty here.</p>

<h4>Turn 1:</h4>
<pre>I enter skarm mode. Rayquaza uses Protect.
Snorlax uses Protect.
Mewtwo uses Protect.
My Metagross uses Explosion.</pre>

<p>Just fucking brilliant. I've already lost this. I was too scared to Agility because I thought his Mewtwo would try to Fire Blast my Metagross or something. I send in Kyogre.</p>

<h4>Turn 2:</h4>
<p>I pondered for a second as to what I should use.</p>

<pre>Worried that his Mewtwo could Ice Beam my Rayquaza, I tried to Extremespeed it... but it Protected. Kyogre's Hydro Pump was fended off by it as well.
Snorlax uses Selfdestruct.</pre>

<p>Bullshit. I really should've used Protect with Kyogre instead. I had to bring in Mewtwo. He brought in Kyogre.</p>

<h4>Turn 3:</h4>
<pre>His Mewtwo Thunders mine for about 51%.
I Thunderbolt his Kyogre for just over 50%.
His Kyogre finishes my Mewtwo with Hydro Pump.</pre>

<p>Final Score: 3-0, him. Meh, gg. If I had used Persian and Smeargle instead, I probably would have stood a better chance. I didn't really think I'd stand a chance against many people I've never even met before.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So I stuck around, to watch TTS, and some of the other battles. I asked what I get for making it to Round 2. I was given: An official Pokemon Emerald strategy guide (that looks better than my older one I should add), a special Pokemon XD GameCube skin (useless because I don't have a GameCube), and a special JAA 2006 clip button. At semis, Justin and TTS were still in. TTS lost in semis to someone named James who used...a 394 Speed Mewtwo! I was like "What the hell? NO ONE I have EVER seen uses that!" He also had Electrode, Dusclops, and Latias as well.</p>

<p>Justin ended up in the finals against James (didn't know his last name). He managed to win it all, 2-0. As I watched Justin's triumph, we walked out the doors of the King of Prussia mall, determined to try even harder next time they have a big event like this.</p>

<p>All is not lost, however. I finally decided something I wanted to do this summer: go to the JAA Championships in New York this August. I talked to my parents about it, and they're thinking about it right now. We may be able to rent a room in a hotel so we can watch the good battles. Hopefully, Justin, Roy, Kongler and such, I'll see you there! And remember to use Fly Rayquaza!</p>

<h2>Things I learned from this</h2>
<ul>
<li>Never put off your training and practice until the last second.</li>
<li>When you're battling someone from Smogon, don't explode turn 1; everything will Protect. Don't listen to Roy's text on AIM/IRC.</li>
<li>Next time Nintendo throws a big event like this, have a GameCube so you can have Selfdestruct Snorlax ready.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the moves you make. Every move counts.</li>
