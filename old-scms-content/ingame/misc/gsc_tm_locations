<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Some of the best moves in the game normally have limited  distribution and can only be taught to some of the best Pokémon through  TMs. Game Freak realizes this and often throws in sidequests or puzzles  to make our lives harder by making us find these valuable items. This  guide will help you find every single TM so your Pokémon will have every  move they need at their disposal.</p>

<h2>Gym Leader TMs</h2>
<img src="/media/ingame/images/ingame_gsc_tmlocations_tm01.png " alt="GymLeaderTMs" />

<p>Ten of the game's fifty TMs are given to you as rewards just  for continuing through the storyline. These TMs are TM01, TM06, TM16,  TM23, TM24, TM23, TM30, TM31, TM45, and TM49. All eight Johto Gym  Leaders and 2 of the Kanto Gym Leaders (Erica and Janine) will give you a  TM. If you do not already have these TMs, simply continue through the  story and you'll have them eventually.</p>

<h2>Purchasable TMs</h2>
<img src="/media/ingame/images/ingame_gsc_tmlocations_tm41.png" alt="TMShopA"  /><img src="/media/ingame/images/ingame_gsc_tmlocations_tm25.png" alt="TMShopB" />

<p>A select few TMs can be purchased infinitely. These TMs are  either bought with the coins won or bought from the Goldenrod or Celadon  City Game Corner or with normal money. The TMs purchasable with money  can be found on the fifth floor of the Goldenrod Department Store and  the third floor of the Celadon Department Store. The TMs located at the  Goldenrod Department Store are TM02, TM08, TM33, TM41, and TM48. TM11,  TM17, TM18, and TM37 are available at the Celadon Department Store. TM02  and TM08 cannot be purchased until they have been found in their normal  locations. Even though TM11, TM18, and TM37 can be found elsewhere in  the game, they will always be for sale at Celadon Department  Store.</p>

<p>The Game Corners in Celadon City and Goldenrod City have 3 TMs  each available for purchase. TM14, TM25, and TM38 are available for 5500  coins each at the Goldenrod Game Corner. TM15, TM29, and TM32 can be  purchased at the Celadon Game Corner for 7500, 3500, and 1500 coins,  respectively.</p>

<h2>The Move Tutor</h2>
<img src="/media/ingame/images/ingame_gsc_tmlocations_movetutor.png " alt="MoveTutor" />

<p>In addition to all fifty TMs, in Pokémon Crystal there are also  three move tutor attacks. A man outside of the Goldenrod City Game  Corner will teach your Pokémon Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, or Flamethrower  for 4000 coins per move on Wednesdays and Saturdays. These moves are  crucial for many Pokémon, so it is suggested that you plan  accordingly.</p>

<h2>Individual TM Locations</h2>
