<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hey everyone, this is an Ubers team i've been using quite a bit lately to get back into the metagame, and I can surely say its done well, making the leaderboard with minimal effort under GERMANYFTW and being a very fun team to play with in general. The team is called Team UBERBOT, although Tab has affectionetly named the team Henry instead.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/389.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Deoxys-S</strong> @ Focus Sash<br/ >
Ability: Pressure<br/ >
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br/ >
Timid Nature<br/ >
- Spikes<br/ >
- Stealth Rock<br/ >
- ExtremeSpeed<br/ >
- Signal Beam</p>

<p>The stereotypical uber lead once again finds its way into an ubers team. After trying a hoard of leads out (like Sash Tyranitar, which is an amazing lead by the way), I finally found it in myself to try out Deoxys-e. Stealth Rock and Spikes are the heart and soul of this team; without them I cannot win nearly as much. Signal Beam + Extreme Speed are enough to beat most other Sash Deoxys-e leads, as well as Deoxys-a. Something I really enjoy about Deoxys-e is that it draws in alot of Choice Banded Scizor for the revenge kill when it has 1 HP left, which is very easy for Wobbuffett to revenge kill.</p>

<p>I am always open to trying out new leads; I've actually been considering trying out reachzero's Deoxys-a lead set and I have tried out a Deoxys-n set created by Jibaku and Theorymon. The only thing I would miss alot is Spikes, which as you well see in the upcoming analysis of my team, benefits almost all of my sweepers.</p>

<p>Things I am considering: TAUNT! I have found alot of times that pokemon come in after I KO the other lead and use Deoxys-e as set up fodder, pokemon like Calm Mind Kyogre and Swords Dance Rayquaza are especially troublesome, as I already have limited coverage against them as it is now.</p>

<p><strong>Mewtwo</strong> @ Life Orb<br/ >
Ability: Pressure<br/ >
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br/ >
Timid Nature<br/ >
- Aura Sphere<br/ >
- Ice Beam<br/ >
- Selfdestruct<br/ >
- Thunder</p>

<p>Here is my first Spike abuser; Mewtwo. Mewtwo has an ABSURD number of viable sets, which attributes to high amount of switches it causes. With this set I feel I am the most dangerous, armed with unparalleled coverage and a move to get rid of any greedy stat uppers and a pokemon that walls a large portion of my team; Blissey. Mewtwo and Latios have ridiculous synergy together, with Mewtwo being able to Explode on Blissey which leaves the door wide open for Latios to come in against stall and drop nearly everything with powerful +1 Dragon Pulses and whatnot. Occasionally the only way for teams to deal with Mewtwo is priority, generally from Choice Band Scizor, or Scarfed pokemon like Dialga and Palkia. This is where you see just how heavily my team relies on Wobb to stop these pokemon, as they are usually the only things stopping me.</p>

<p>Darkrai was originally in this slot, but after realizing that Mewtwo had a much easier time breaking down the door early game against stall, I decided it would be for the best if I replaced Darkrai with Mewtwo entirely. Mewtwo is also a very solid check to Life Orb Nasty Plot Darkrai, which is much more troublesome after replacing Kyogre with Latios. Mewtwo's Selfdestruct is generally my safeblanket if CM Kyogre or CM Latias/Latios get too many boosts under their belt. The speed is also great for revenging a hoard of threats.</p>

<p>Things I'm Considering: LO CM Mewtwo or Taunt CM Mewtwo. Taunt CM Mewtwo seems like a great option for overloading Blissey without having to KO myself, and LO CM seems like it'd hit like a nuke against slower offensive teams, although for now I'm rather comfortable using my current set.</p>

<p><strong>Lucario</strong> @ Life Orb<br/ >
Ability: Inner Focus<br/ >
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br/ >
Adamant Nature<br/ >
- Swords Dance<br/ >
- Crunch<br/ >
- Close Combat<br/ >
- ExtremeSpeed</p>

<p>Perhaps the best abuser of Spikes in the uber metagame is Lucario. If I had to straightout pick the most valuable mon on this team besides Wobb, it'd go to Lucario hands down. It has an absurd amount of chances to boost, and it makes very good use of them. I have tried out Swords Dance Rayquaza in this spot previously, and I can easily say I like Lucario alot more for 2 reasons. The first one is Close Combat, a ridiculously overpowered STAB attack that does not get you locked in, and the 2nd is the 4x Stealth Rock resistance. The biggest drag to me when using Rayquaza was the Stealth Rock weakness, which I often found hampering me when trying to boost and sweep, as well as making me priority fodder in general when sitting at 65-75%. The less powerful Extreme Speed is not a turn off in the least either. Encoring stat uppers with Wobb gives me a very easy Swords Dance and generally leaves me at 97% after one boost, which means i'm not nearly as vulnerable to priority as Rayquaza.</p>

<p>If you haven't noticed already, Lucario is my only steel type and my only Dark resistance alongside 5 dark weaknesses. This puts alot of pressure on Lucario at times, which is something I don't always want, especially seeing how fragile Lucario is as it is. This large dark weakness has not been a problem so far, although if it were to become one I suppose I could just go back to CM Kyogre > CM Latios, which also provides me with extra Taunt CM Mewtwo insurance, as right now I tend to just bludgeon away at it and hope it doesn't come in against Wobb.</p>

<p>Things I'm Considering: CALL ME CRAZY BUT I WANT TO TRY MUSCLE BAND. In all seriousness, I accidentally forgot Life Orb on Lucario in the first version of this team (named after periodic elements!) and found that alot of people just tend to try to wait out Lucario's wrath by switching around to build up Life Orb recoil / Close Combat defense drops until they can use priority to kill it off. With Muscle Band this would be alot harder, although I guess it wouldn't be worth the power loss...</p>

<p><strong>Wobbuffet</strong> @ Leftovers<br/ >
Ability: Shadow Tag<br/ >
EVs: 92 HP / 164 Def / 252 SpD<br/ >
Calm Nature<br/ >
- Mirror Coat<br/ >
- Encore<br/ >
- Counter<br/ >
- Safeguard</p>

<p>The absolute crux of this teams success. Without this pokemon, this team would be nothing. As the nickname states, this is the pokemon I use to get rid of Scarfers like Dialga and Palkia, as well as some Choice Banders like Scizor. I use these 3 pokemon as examples because if you notice my team, these are 3 pokemon that can easily control the match against my team with proper prediction. Once Wobb elminates them, the game easily turns around in my favor. Besides taking out the aforementioned Scarfers, it also provides plenty of free turns for Lucario to Swords Dance, for Latios to Calm Mind, and for Giratina-o to come in to start wreaking havoc. My main mission when I decided to get back into Ubers was to abuse Wobbuffet to it's fullest extent, to create a team to prove to myself just how much it changes the game. I can easily say it has not let me down at all, it is my favorite pokemon in this metagame and perhaps the most broken if played correctly.</p>

<p>Against stall, Wobb is perhaps my biggest tool to gain an advantage. Safeguard grants me a wonderful Toxic Spikes immunity, and since Stall seems to be carrying Scarf Palkia alot to revenge kill threats, it gains me another advantage in that sense. Although Wobb is the teams greatest asset against stall, it's also possibly the greatest asset against offense too, which once again proves how valuable Wobbuffet is to a well constructed Uber team.</p>

<p>Things I'm Considering: Perhaps just a little more special defense to survive Specs Kyogre Surf after Stealth Rock. Other than that I'm pretty set. <img src="http://puu.sh/3JYJT.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Giratina-O</strong> @ Griseous Orb<br/ >
Ability: Levitate<br/ >
EVs: 44 Atk / 212 SpA / 252 Spe<br/ >
Hasty Nature<br/ >
- Dragon Pulse<br/ >
- Shadow Sneak<br/ >
- Outrage<br/ >
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>Excellent spinblocker. Hidden Power [Fire] is great for keeping Forry away, and occasionally surprisingly it as it switches in as well. You may be curious about Shadow Sneak, but it helps me with my Taunt CM Mewtwo weakness as well as a somewhat god awful CM Latios / Latias weakness. With Hasty and max speed, I become a rather reliable Lucario check in the sun, as well as an Adamant Rayquaza check aswell. Outrage allows me to get a large hit on Blissey, generally enough for an OHKO in wake of several layers and a little previous damage. Dragon Pulse is excellent STAB in Ubers because of the shortness of steels other than Forry / Lucario (not counting Dialga because it still takes neutral dmg from Dragon). Giratina-o is named JIBABOT because it was Jibaku who inspired me to use Giratina-o after reading his uber stall team and writing about it in the Smog, I had just never had much of a chance up until now.</p>

<p>The immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes allow me to continuously come into Forretress if I can predict around Payback. The EVs may seem a bit strange, but unless someone can find better ones, I am keeping them. Platinum Orb boosted Outrage has been OHKOing Ho Oh after SR, which is always wonderful (especially against sun oriented stall, where I find Ho Oh difficult to KO sometimes). Stall has been crumbling under the hands of Giratina-o rather quickly when paired with Wobbuffet carnage, and this is a combo I urge you all to at least test.</p>

<p>Things I'm Considering: more attack for a harder hitting Shadow Sneak / Outrage, preferably in place of Special Attack. If anyone has any physical based MixTina-o EVs, please share <img src="http://puu.sh/3JYJT.png" alt="" />. I was considering Thunder > HP Fire when running Kyogre, so if I end up using Ogre > Latios again I will consider changing.</p>

<p><strong>Latios</strong> @ Soul Dew<br/ >
Ability: Levitate<br/ >
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br/ >
Timid Nature<br/ >
- Hidden Power Fire<br/ >
- Calm Mind<br/ >
- Dragon Pulse<br/ >
- Thunder</p>

<p>The final member of the team is Latios, but he is certainly not the least. I admit I have not tested Latios as much as I have Kyogre, but after reachzero suggested it and Theorymon gave me a set to use, I fell in love. Latios gives me a better switch into Water Spouts (although not as safe as Latias, its better than nothing). Thunder gives me a tool to hit Kyogre as well, while Dragon Pulse is simple STAB and HP Fire will keep Scizor at bay, which is important because I have 4 bug weaknesses and only 2 resists. Calm Mind allows me to boost my already sky high special attack even higher. I am debating whether or not to use Recover over Hidden Power Fire or not, as Scizor already seems to fear Thunder, the only problem is when its sunny. While Latios only has a few sets seen commonly in Ubers, its sheer power allows it to force switches a large amount of the time. Once Blissey is killed off by Giratina or Mewtwo, stall seems to lack a definite answer for Latios, which is a great advantage.</p>

<p>In place of this was originally 3 Attack Max Speed Timid Kyogre, which while it was a very unexpected sweeper, it seemed to hamper my team more than it helped at times. I am currently juggling between these 2, unsure of which is doing a better job, but am currently using Latios.</p>

<p>Things I'm Considering: Recover over HP Fire; it allows me to keep my perfect speed as opposed to using a speed IV of 30, and allows me to increase longevity.</p>
