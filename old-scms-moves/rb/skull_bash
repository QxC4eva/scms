<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Charges up turn one, and then attacks turn two.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Like all moves that take a turn to charge up, Skull Bash is not a good competitive move. Unlike other charge-up moves like Fly or Dig, Skull Bash does not allow the user to avoid attacks. Like all other charge-up moves, during the charge-up turn, the opponent can easily switch to a counter who can easily absorb the Skull Bash like Snorlax, giving the opponent momentum. It's a very bad move that should never be used.</p>
