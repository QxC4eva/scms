<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>A very good move that halves physical damage and stops Tauros. This move makes Chansey and Alakazam able to face Tauros, Rhydon, and Golem; healing back the damage dealt in the mean time with Softboiled or Recover. Reflect Alakazam is a Pokemon to be considered for any team, as it can wall all attacks, Recover health back, and still deal powerful damage with Psychic.</p>
