<p>Welcome to (yet another) Puzzle Page here at The Smog! As always, we're open to feedback; if there's some type of puzzle you'd like to see included in the next issue, or if you have a gripe with this issue's puzzles, feel free to send a VM to Level 51 or air your opinion in the feedback poll or release thread.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, we're not giving out six prizes this time around, but five! Congratulations once again to xfix, who was the only user to win a prize for the Mystery Sound puzzles, as well as ethan06, GiraGoomy, and Instant Apple Pie for their successful efforts in the parameter puzzles! Finally, congratulations to tape, as well, for being the first user to submit a completely correct crossword grid! We'll be contacting tape about his custom avatar shortly.</p>

<h2>Parameter Puzzles</h2>
<p>Your challenge for these questions is to obtain the given list of Pok&eacute;mon from the "/dexsearch" command on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! using the correct number of parameters as shown! Note that "all" does not count as a parameter and that the exclusions mentioned are included in the total number of parameters. Can you figure out which parameters were used to obtain these results?</p>
<p>Simply type "/dexsearch" on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! for a quick introduction to the command. The first three users to send in all 15 correct answers will earn themselves a custom title on the Smogon forums; failing which, the first three users with the highest scores will earn these custom titles instead!</p>
