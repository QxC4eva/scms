[LONG DESC]
<p>If any the target's stat levels can be raised, then Acupressure raises one of those stat levels by 2, chosen at random with uniform probability among the stat levels that can be raised. If none of the target's stat's levels can be raised, Acupressure fails.</p>

<p>Note that if the target has a Substitute, this move has no effect, even if the target is the user of the move.</p>
