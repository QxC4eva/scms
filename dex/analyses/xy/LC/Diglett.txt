Overview
########
- Diglett reaches 20 Speed, making it the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, alongside Elekid and Voltorb.
- It has a fantastic ability in Arena Trap, allowing it to trap and remove certain threats.
- Despite these two great qualities, it is weak without a Life Orb and it's incredibly frail which makes it difficult to switch into anything.

Trapper
########
name: Trapper
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Substitute / Memento
move 4: Shadow Claw / Sucker Punch / Stealth Rock
ability: Arena Trap
item: Life Orb / Focus Sash 
evs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
- Earthquake is Diglett's main STAB attack, KOing most weakened Pokemon. 
- Rock Slide is Diglett's coverage move, hitting Murkrow, Vullaby and other Flying-types. 
- Substitute lets Diglett bypass Sucker Punch, which is particularly useful for trapping Pawniard, and also allows it to avoid status.
- Memento is a good last ditch effort after Diglett revenge kills an opponent to avoid the opposing Pokemon setting up and giving your own Pokemon a chance to set up. 
- Shadow Claw reliably hits Misdreavus and other Ghost-types. 
- Sucker Punch lets Diglett KO Pokemon that use priority such as a very weakened Meditite or Fletchling. 
- Diglett can also use its Speed to set up Stealth Rock before it is KOed. 

Set Details
========
- The EVs maximize Speed and Attack with the leftovers put into HP. 
- Life Orb gives more immediate power and does not limit its usefulness later in the game with hazards up. 
- Focus Sash lets Diglett more reliably switch into Pokemon such as Chinchou if hazards are not up.

Usage Tips
========
- Diglett is not bulky enough to be switched into many attacks, even weak ones, so it is best to keep it for revenge killing unless there's a predicted Electric-type attack. 
- Diglett is fairly weak, so it's important to make sure your opponent cannot set up after Diglett KOes something. 

Team Options
========

- Diglett is best paired with something that benefits from the trapping of Chinchou or other Electric-types such as Magnemite. 
- It also benefits greatly from U-turn users or hazards of its own to break Magnemite's Sturdy or weaken the opponent to Diglett's KO range. 
- Knock Off support is very useful for bringing more things into Diglett's KO range.
Theif and Berry Juice can be used as an interesting way to remove an opponent's item. 

Other Options
#########
- Diglett can use Protect and function well as a lead, setting up Stealth Rock with impunity with the ability to Memento afterwards to avoid set up or Rapid Spin by the opponent. 
- Diglett can also run a Choice Scarf set to revenge kill other Choice Scarfers such as Pawniard or weakened set up sweepers such as Scraggy

Counters
#########
**Flying-types/Levitate**: These Pokemon will not take much damage from any of Diglett's coverage moves even if they are super effective. They can also switch out from Diglett's Arena Trap.

**Physically Bulky Pokemon**: Diglett is not very strong, so Pokemon such as Hippopotas, Spritzee, and Slowpoke, while not immune or resistant to Earthquake, will still not be easily KOed by it and can deal heavy damage in return. 

**Priority**: Due to Diglett's incredibly weak defenses, most priority moves will OHKO it meaning it is easily revenged.
