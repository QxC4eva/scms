Boosts Attack and accuracy one stage.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Attack and accuracy by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Hone Claws is outclassed by Swords Dance in most cases since Pokemon's STAB moves do not need accuracy boosts, but there are a few Pokemon that make good use of the move. Durant is the best example; it does not learn Swords Dance, and has the Hustle ability. Hone Claws's accuracy boost alleviates Hustle's accuracy drop, and the combined power of the two elements grants Durant phenomenal power.</p>
