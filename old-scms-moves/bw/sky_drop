<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage on the turn after it is used. On the first turn, the user flies into the air, carrying the target with it. While in the air, the target cannot attack, and neither the user nor the target can be hit by any other moves, besides Gust, Hurricane, Sky Uppercut, Smack Down, Thunder, and Twister, a move used by a Pokemon with No Guard, or if the user had previously been targeted by Mind Reader or Lock-On. On the second turn, the user deals damage and the target returns to the ground. Sky Drop will fail if the target is behind a Substitute. Sky Drop does not deal any damage if the target is Flying-type or has Levitate, unless they are under the effects of Smack Down, but will pick them up and make them unable to move for one turn. Sky Drop works as normal against a target under the effects of Magnet Rise or Telekinesis. In a rotation battle, if the target is rotated out while in the air, it will drop back down without any damage, and the newly rotated in Pokemon can still attack. This move cannot be used while Gravity is active. Fails on the first turn if the target is an ally.</p> 

<h2>Sky Drop Glitch</h2>
<p>This move was illegal in most VGC rulesets, including Smogon's VGC 2012 and Wi-Fi Random Matches, owing to a glitch that occurred when the move Gravity is used while the Sky Drop user and target are in the air. The user continued the battle as normal, but the target remained unable to move until either the user was knocked out or switched out, or else the target was hit by a move. This has since been fixed in BW2.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2> 
<p>Sky Drop is a very gimmicky move that might actually see results, on occasion. Unlike other moves that need to charge up, Sky Drop does not allow the opponent to get a free switch when used. Sky Drop is best used with Toxic; since the target cannot switch or attack, it is forced to take two extra turns of Toxic damage, as well as the damage from Sky Drop itself.</p>
