<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Changes the target's ability to that of the user. Fails if the target actually has Multitype, Truant, or the same ability as the user. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<p>This move fails if the user has any of the following abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flower Gift</li>
<li>Forecast</li>
<li>Illusion</li>
<li>Imposter</li>
<li>Multitype</li>
<li>Trace</li>
<li>Zen Mode</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Entrainment has poor distribution, and thus does not see much competitive use. Furthermore, its effect is gimmicky since it depends on the user's ability; it will likely have little effect on some opponents with an already useless ability.</p>

<h2>Related Moves</h2>
<p>No other moves have the same effect as Entrainment, but <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> changes the opponent's ability with one's own; however, one's ability will also be switched with the opponent's.</p>
