Overview
########

Deoxys-D is fully capable of being a great team member, but it always seems to be overshadowed by its brother, Deoxys-S. It has great defenses and access to reliable recovery, allowing it to stay around and get entry hazards up throughout the match. Thanks to its great bulk, Deoxys-D is also able to check some top threats such as Azumarill and Talonflame. However, Deoxys-D isn't without its faults. Top threats such as Aegislash, Tyranitar, Scizor, and Genesect can all break through Deoxys-D rather easily. Moreover, base attacking stats of 70 mean that Deoxys-D often has to rely on Seismic Toss to inflict damage, something that Deoxys-S doesn't really have to deal with. The buff to Defog is also a big pain, but Deoxys-D's solid bulk and reliable recovery means that it can often outlast some users of the move. Overall, Deoxys-D is a solid Pokemon, but be sure to take advantage of its bulk, not its Speed, when setting up entry hazards.

Fast Hazard Setter
########
name: Fast Hazard Setter
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Spikes
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Thunder Wave / Magic Coat
item: Mental Herb / Red Card
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Although Deoxys-S may be better at setting up entry hazards quickly, Deoxys-D has much better bulk, allowing it to take hits without relying on a Focus Sash. Base 90 Speed also isn't terrible for a defensive Pokemon. Stealth Rock and Spikes are obvious moves on this set, as Deoxys-D wants to get them up as quickly as possible. Taunt stops slower Defog and entry hazard users such as Skarmory, Togekiss, and Landorus-T. You can even use Taunt if you suspect that a faster Defog or entry hazard user, such as Latios or Garchomp, is about to switch in. Thunder Wave is the main move for the final slot. Along with Mental Herb, it allows Deoxys-D to cripple faster Taunt users and follow up with a Taunt of its own to safely set up entry hazards. Another countermeasure against faster Taunt users is Magic Coat. This can let Deoxys-D make any status move, such as Taunt, Stealth Rock, and Toxic, backfire against the Pokemon using it. This is especially useful against teams that use Pokemon with a severe Stealth Rock weakness, such as Mega Charizard Y or Mega Pinsir, but forgo Defog or Rapid Spin users.

Set Details
========

The EV spread gives Deoxys-D as much bulk and Speed as possible so it can reliably set up entry hazards for its team. A Timid nature is used to get entry hazards up even faster. Mental Herb is the most sensible item to use as it lets Deoxys-D safely bypass faster Taunt users and hit them with its own Taunt. Red Card is a decent alternative that allows Deoxys-D to force out any threat that can't OHKO it. You can use a Tanga Berry to take less damage from Genesect's and Scizor's STAB U-turns. A Colbur Berry can be used to survive Crunch from Tyranitar, as well as a Knock Off from Bisharp. A Kasib Berry lets Deoxys-D stand up to Ghost-types such as Aegislash better. Another option is Rocky Helmet, which can wear down physical attackers that try to break through Deoxys-D. Finally, Leftovers can work to gain some passive recovery. However, keep in mind that these niche options only help against select threats and that Deoxys-D should aim to get entry hazards up as quickly as and efficiently as possible before going down. If Tyranitar is giving you fits, you can use Superpower. Be sure to use a Jolly nature if you decide to run Superpower so its power isn't lowered. At least 212 Attack EVs is needed with a Life Orb to ensure the KO. Ice Beam is also an option with 196 Special Attack EVs and a Life Orb to ensure an OHKO on Landorus-T.

Usage Tips
========

This set is best used as a suicide lead of sorts on hyper offense teams. Due to the combination of Mental Herb and Thunder Wave, Deoxys-D is almost guaranteed to get hazards up against most opposing Taunt users. When facing a Prankster Taunt user such as Sableye or Whimsicott, you should use Taunt as paralyzing them won't help much due to Prankster granting their Taunts priority. Even if Deoxys-D is met with something that is probably going to KO it, you should leave it in. Remember, the goal of this set is to simply get up as many layers of entry hazards as possible before going down. Only use Thunder Wave and Taunt as they are needed against threatening Pokemon for your team and slower defensive Pokemon, respectively.

Team Options
========

As this set aims to get entry hazards up quickly, offensive Pokemon that can take advantage of the switches that they force are ideal teammates. Lucario, Latios, and Talonflame are great examples of this. Greninja and Genesect are also notable due to their ability to use U-turn and to beat most users of Defog and Rapid Spin. Do note that Genesect will need a Choice Scarf to outspeed Latios, the fastest common user of Defog. A spinblocker to defeat Assault Vest Excadrill and Mega Blastoise is also a good choice. Trevenant and Nasty Plot + Trick Room Cofagrigus are solid options. Life Orb Aegislash can also be useful as it can Shadow Sneak Latios into oblivion before it gets a chance to use Defog, while very few other Pokemon can get in its way when hazards are on the field. Speaking of Defog, Bisharp is a solid teammate for its ability to take advantage of the evasion drop incurred from being hit with the move, as the resulting +2 Attack boost from Defiant can potentially let Bisharp sweep the opposing team.

Bulky Hazard Setter
########
name: Bulky Hazard Setter
move 1: Stealth Rock / Spikes
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Recover
move 4: Seismic Toss
item: Leftovers / Rocky Helmet
evs: 252 HP / 244 Def / 12 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

This is a more defensive approach to Deoxys-D, using its superior bulk to set up entry hazards and keep top threats, such as Azumarill and Talonflame, in check. Stealth Rock is the easier entry hazard to set up and keep due to the Defog buff. Spikes is a decent alternative as Deoxys-D has the bulk to set up multiple layers over the course of the match. Taunt is useful to stop slower Defog and entry hazard users, such as Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Togekiss, while also letting Deoxys-D to set up its own entry hazards without much risk. Recover is absolutely necessary so Deoxys-D can stay as a defensive force after setting up entry hazards. Seismic Toss rounds off the set to let Deoxys-D deal reliable damage and to keep it from becoming complete Taunt bait.

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Deoxys-D to have as much physical bulk as possible in order to check threats such as Talonflame, Azumarill, and Excadrill, while the 12 Speed EVs enable Deoxys-D to outspeed minimum Speed Landorus-T so it can Taunt the latter before it can set up Stealth Rock. A Bold nature is used over Impish to minimize Foul Play and confusion damage. Leftovers is the primary item choice as Deoxys-D won't always have the time to use Recover, and the passive recovery can give it the extra turn it needs to get a Recover in. Rocky Helmet is an alternative, as it lets Deoxys-D punish the physical attackers that attempt to break through it, and the EV spread works well with it. Speaking of the EV spread, a Calm nature with an EV spread of 252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 Spe can be used to better handle special attacks from the likes of Latios, but many top special attackers like Greninja and Genesect catch Deoxys-D for super effective damage anyway. Thunder Wave and Toxic are two status moves Deoxys-D can use over Seismic Toss if you wish. Thunder Wave can cripple sweepers, while Toxic can make it easier for a teammate to break past a wall it would otherwise have trouble with.

Usage Tips
========

This Deoxys-D is best used on more defensive or stall-based teams, as it can take hits from a wide range of physical attackers while preventing most opposing defensive Pokemon from using recovery or supportive moves with a decently fast Taunt. Despite Deoxys-D's high Special Defense, don't attempt to leave it in on powerful special attackers unless you run the alternate EV spread. Despite the HP investment, Deoxys-D only tops out at 304 HP, so the likes of Latios, Greninja, and Genesect can still push past it with their powerful STAB moves. Be very careful around Tyranitar, Scizor, and Genesect. A well-timed Pursuit or U-turn from them will compromise Deoxys-D's defensive capabilities for later in the match, so don't be afraid of switching out if you feel like one of them is about to switch in. Always remember to use Deoxys-D's ability to check powerful threats, such as Azumarill and Talonflame, to set up entry hazards, rather than its Speed. Otherwise, you're better off using Deoxys-S.

Team Options
========

Since Deoxys-D has a hard time taking powerful special attacks from the likes of Latios, Greninja, and Genesect, having a teammate that can take these threats on is very helpful. Sylveon is immune to Draco Meteor, isn't weak to any move Greninja commonly carries, and only fears Iron Head from Genesect's physically attacking sets. It can also use Heal Bell to rid Dexoys-D of any status it was unfortunate enough to be hit with. Tyranitar, Scizor, and Genesect are the biggest pains for Deoxys-D. Mega Lucario destroys Tyranitar and can overpower Scizor and Genesect, while Deoxys-D can fend off Conkeldurr and Talonflame, two of Mega Lucario's biggest checks. Trevenant and Cofagrigus can spinblock against Assault Vest Excadrill and Mega Blastoise, although both have to be wary of a possible Shadow Claw or Dark Pulse. Bisharp is able to take advantage of any overzealous Defog user and possibly sweep with the +2 Attack boost from Defiant. It can also switch in on Ghost- and Dark-type moves aimed at Deoxys-D, while Deoxys-D can cover the Fighting-type weakness that Bisharp has.

Other Options
########

Deoxys-D has a fairly expansive movepool, so there's definitely some other things that may appeal to you. Rain Dance and Sunny Day can be used with the appropriate weather rock. Dual screens with Light Clay is also possible, but Deoxys-S is much, much faster, making it better for this in most cases. If you really hate not being able to hit Ghost-types, Night Shade can be used over Seismic Toss. However, most Ghost-types can easily destroy Deoxys-D either way. Protect can scout for possible dangerous moves that the opposing Pokemon may have, but it's hard to fit onto any set. Knock Off received a power buff, making it rather useful, but it is also difficult to find a moveslot for it. Fire Punch can take out Scizor and Genesect, but has next to no use outside of that. Calm Mind and Nasty Plot can be used for boosting sets, but status moves can put an easy end to this. Deoxys-D has an amazing offensive movepool, but outside of the sheer power of Psycho Boost, nothing it has is going to hit that hard off of base 70 attacking stats.

Checks and Counters
########

**Strong Pursuit / U-turn Users**: Any Pokemon that has a strong U-turn or Pursuit can make Deoxys-D a liability. Tyranitar, Scizor, and Genesect are the best examples. Scizor and Genesect can easily snatch momentum with a STAB U-turn, while Tyranitar and Scizor can use Pursuit on a fleeing Deoxys-D. If either of these three can hit it with U-turn or Pursuit, Deoxys-D's defensive capabilities will likely be compromised later in the match due to the high damage it takes from these moves.

**Prankster Taunt Users**: Unless it carries Magic Coat, Prankster Taunt users can easily shut down Deoxys-D. Klefki, Thundurus, and Whimsicott are the most commonly seen Prankster Pokemon, but Sableye is also an option, and it's even immune to Seismic Toss.

** Magic Bounce Pokemon**: Espeon, Xatu, and Mega Absol are the only three Magic Bounce users in the game, but they are all full stops to Deoxys-D that, unlike Prankster Taunt users, don't have to worry about Magic Coat when stopping Deoxys-D from setting entry hazards. Even better, they can bounce back Taunt if the Deoxys-D user tries to cripple a slower Defog or entry hazard user.

**Powerful Special Attackers**: Greninja, Gengar, and Genesect are the primary examples, but most Pokemon with a high base Special Attack and a powerful neutral STAB move can generally 2HKO Deoxys-D. Latios and Thundurus-T are examples of Pokemon that can severely dent Deoxys-D due to the sheer power of their STAB attacks.

**Ghost-types**: Just about any Ghost-type can beat Deoxys-D, as they are immune to Seismic Toss and can hit it for super effective damage. Aegislash, Gengar, Cofagrigus, and Trevenant are examples of such Ghost-types.

**Status**: Toxic is the best status to use on Deoxys-D, but most users of the move may be Taunted before they can use it. Sableye is an exception thanks to Prankster giving priority to Toxic.

**Defog and Rapid Spin*: As Deoxys-D will usually be setting up entry hazards for its team, users of these moves can limit Deoxys-D's impact on the match. Latios, Togekiss, and Skarmory are solid Defog users, while Excadrill, Mega Blastoise, and Starmie are reliable Rapid Spinners.

**Deoxys-S**: In a match of setting entry hazards, Deoxys-S will always win if it carries Magic Coat. Deoxys-D can only hope to take it out with Seismic Toss or outpredict the Deoxys-S user and get a Taunt in before being hit with Taunt or Magic Coat itself.
