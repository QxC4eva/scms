<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Defense by two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Defensive boosting moves are often looked down upon competitively, since very rarely do they help their user to escape the clutches of their common checks and counters, especially due to the existence of critical hits, and the boosts are lost as soon as one switches out, which is very likely for a defensive Pokemon. However, Acid Armor does see some use on Baton Pass chain teams, as one of the most notable Baton Passers, Vaporeon, can use this move as part of the chain to make the team impenetrable to physical attacks, and then pass the boosts on to the finishing sweeper. However, very few other Pokemon can make good use of this move.</p>
