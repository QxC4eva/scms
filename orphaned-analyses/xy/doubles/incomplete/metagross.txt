Moves
========
Meteor Mash is a powerful STAB, having a fairly good chance of raising Metagross's Attack one stage.
Bullet Punch is for STAB Priority
Earthquake is for coverage, since Metagross's STABs aren't very good in terms of coverage
Zen Headbutt provides nice secondary STAB, and the flinch chance isn't too shabby either.
Alternatively, Ice Punch can be used to hit Shaymin, Garchomp, Landorus, and the like.

Usage Tips
========
Bullet Punch isn't meant to kill, it's meant to finish off. Only use it when the opponent is severely weakened. Otherwise, resort to Meteor Mash if you really feel the urge to use a Steel type move.
The Attack boost from Meteor Mash is just icing on the cake. Do not use Meteor Mash in an attempt to get a mini-Swords Dance boost. Metagross is meant to be an all-out attacker with a boost to Special Defense. Use it as such.
