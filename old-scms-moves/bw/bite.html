<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Bite is too weak to be considered competitively useful barring a few special cases. Generally, Crunch, Night Slash, and Payback are superior physical Dark-type attacks. However, there are a few Pokemon that learn no better Dark-type attack, such as Mamoswine, and some Pokemon that may consider using this move in conjunction with Technician; Persian, for instance, though not common, can hit with 90 Base Power, and has the excellent Speed required to abuse Bite's 30% flinch rate. </p>
