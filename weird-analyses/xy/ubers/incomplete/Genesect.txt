Overview

    Many great Pokemon qualities: great defensive typing, respectable offensive typing, an amazing movepool, and awesome base stats, including a nice 99 speed. Download further boosts it's offenses, but is unreliable, sometimes boosting the offensive stat you don't need.
    With the Steel Nerf and Fairy typing, Genesect is in an interesting situation. While it could once reliably switch into a Dark type like Dakrai at full health, now it is cleanly 2HKOd by a STAB Dark Pulse, making Genesect's defenses seem a lot more frail. However, the introduction of Fairy type Pokemon gives Genesect more of a reason than ever to run Iron Head, being able to get a clean OHKO on Xerneas after a +1 boost.
    Genesect's greatest power is not it's raw strength, but rather it's ability to easily keep momentum on the side of it's trainer. STAB U-turn allows Genesect to lead, sweep, scout, and more. Every time you see a Genesect use U-turn, prepare yourself, because much like the terminator, it will be back.

move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Ice Beam/Blaze Kick
move 4: Explosion/Flamethrower/Extremespeed
ability: Download
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk, 252 Spe, 4 HP/4 SpA
nature: Hasty/Jolly

Moves
========

    U-turn is the flagship move. It allows the cyborg to hit pure Psychic, Grass, and Dark types hard, do heavy damage to anything which doesn't resist it, and most importantly, shift momentum in your favor.
    Iron Head allows Genesect to smash Xerneas, Sylveon, and miscellaneous Fairy Pokemon, reliably do damage, and clean late game.
    Ice Beam provides great coverage and also lets Genesect use +1 Special Attack boosts. Gets OHKOs on thing like Skymin and often Rayquaza, while doing heavy damage to Pokemon like Groudon and Zekrom.
    Blaze Kick lets Genesect beat Steel Type Pokemon which can give it trouble.
    Explosion allows Genesect to metaphorically nuke one Pokemon into oblivion.
    Flamethrower can be used instead of Blaze Kick to utilize special Download boosts.
    Extremespeed is the only priority Genesect gets, but it doesn't hit terribly hard.
    other special moves can be used for coverage.


Set Details
========

    Max attack to hit the hardest physically
    Max Speed, in conjunction with a choice scarf lets Genesect outspeed nearly all of the metagame.
    Any Genesect which runs either Blaze Kick, Extremespeed,
    or both must be both Shiny and run a Hasty nature.
    The last 4 EVs can be dumped into either HP or SpA, depending on whether you want to add a little bit of power to Genesect's special side, or slightly increase it's durability.


Usage Tips
========

    Genesect's greatest ability is the power to easily keep momentum on your side. That means that Genesect should be sent in as a revenge killer, lead, or sent in when you predict it's typing will let it survive a hit. For example, with a Choice Scarf Equipped, Genesect's U-turn will normally do around 50% to standard offensive Specs/Scarf Kyogre.
    Iron Head is your most reliable cleaning tool, letting Genesect get 2HKOs on weakened Pokemon like Mewtwo towards the end of a match. It also allows Genesect to hit fairy types such as Xerneas and Sylveon exceedingly hard.
    The final option can be used to give Genesect a myriad of abilities. You can install a self destruct mechanism in Genesect with Explosion, give Genesect priority through Extremespeed, or increase it's coverage with other special moves.
    Ultimately, use Genesect as a momentum-giving tool. U-turn will help with this. Play Genesect well, and you have one hell of a Cyborg Scout, Lead, and-all around killing machine.

III. Special Choice Scarf

###########
Specially inclined Choice Scarf
move 1: U-turn
move 2: Thunder/Thunderbolt
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Flamethrower/Bug Buzz/other special move/other physical move
ability: Download
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 SpA, 252 Spe, 4 HP/ 4 Atk
nature: Hasty

Moves
========
Genesect has an amazing special movepool, and all of it's special moves can be boosted by Download to hit even harder.

    U-turn remains on this set to keep momentum on your side, but the remaining moves allow Genesect to hit very hard specially.
    Thunder lets Genesect do heavy damage to the Water and Flying types which are scattered throughout Ubers. The lower accuracy is a hinderence, but Genesect needs the raw power. If you're still wary of Thunders accuracy, you can opt for Thunderbolt.
    Ice Beam pairs well with the above options, letting Genesect acquire perfect neutral coverage across the tier.
    Flamethrower melts Steel types which can give Genesect trouble.
    Bug Buzz offers a high-power STAB attack which now hits behind Substitutes.
    You can also fit in another powerful special attack such as Dark Pulse, or a second physical move to add damage potential.


Set Details
========

    252 Special Attack lets Genesect deal the most potential damage specially.
    252 Speed and with a Choice Scarf lets Genesect outrun most of the metagame.
    The remaining 4 EVs can be placed into either HP or Atk, depending on whether you want to give a small boost to Genesect's U-Turn or slightly increase its durability.


Usage Tips
========

    Genesect's greatest ability is the power to easily keep momentum on your side. This set hits specially, and thus has different things it can get OHKOs on.
    This set is not able to utilize U-turn as an effective damage dealing move, it is now only used form momentum shifting.


Team Options

Gene + Ho-oh works well, will add more...


IV. Choice Band
###########
Fast Choice Band

move 1: U-turn
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Blaze Kick
move 4: Explosion/ Ice Beam/ Extreme Speed
ability: Download
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk, 252 Spe, 4HP
nature: Hasty

Moves
========

    The premier move is U-Turn, which allows the cyborg to hit pure Psychic, Grass, and Dark types extremely hard, do heavy damage to anything which doesn't resist it, and most importantly, shift momentum in your favor.
    Iron Head allows Genesect to destroy Xerneas, Sylveon, and miscellaneous Fairy type Pokemon. If Genesect is staying in, this will be the move which is used most.
    Blaze Kick lets Genesect beat Steel Type Pokemon which otherwise will shut the cyborg down.
    Explosion allows Genesect to absolutely nuke an enemy Pokemon.
    Ice Beam, despite being a special move, provides great coverage, while letting Genesect abuse +1 SpA Download boosts.
    Extremespeed is the only priority Genesect gets, and it has reasonable power with a Choice Band.
    Other special moves can be used for coverage, but banded Genesect want's to hit hard physically, not specially.


Set Details
========

    Max attack is used so that banded Genesect can hit its very hardest.
    Max speed is still necessary. 99 speed is still above most Ubers, and Genesect needs to be in that speed tier.
    Hasty nature + Shiny coloring is needed to use Extremespeed and Blaze Kick.
    Final 4 EVs should be put into HP, or SpA if you're running a special move.


Usage Tips
========

    Genesect gets more attack Power from a Band and can get Potential download boosts. Unfortunately, it still has difficulty getting outright OKHOs on things that are not weak to its attacks.
    The set is still pretty fast by Ubers standards, but now anything above 99 poses an immediate threat, like flamethrower Mewtwo, something which is outrun with a scarf.

V. Shift Gear

###########
Set up Sweeper with Shift Gear
move 1: Shift Gear
move 2: Extremespeed
move 3: Blaze Kick
move 4: Iron Head/Explosion/U-turn
ability: Download
item: Life Orb/ Leftovers
evs: 252 Atk, 252 Spe, 4HP (Speed can be replaced with HP and vice versa)
nature: Hasty

Moves
========

    Shift Gear is mandatory for setting up.
    Extremespeed provides solid priority after Shift Gear boost. It pairs well with the set up option.
    Blaze Kick lets Genesect get around Steel types which would outright wall this set.
    Final move is up to the trainer; Iron Head is reliable STAB, Explosion provides extreme power, and U-turn is highly powerful STAB + momentum, but it can be counterproductive to a sweeping set.

Set Details
========

    Hasty Nature + Shiny coloration is mandatory for this set.
    252 attack is needed to have the most power.
    252 speed is actually not needed as much on this set, due to Shift Gear boosts. Instead, you can dump the EVs into HP to make setting up easier.

Usage Tips
========

    Quite different from other sets, focuses on staying around to sweep rather than zipping in and out of the battle.
    Main niche is the incredible speed granted by a Shift Gear boost and utilizing either an attack boost + priority, or an attack boost +powerful physical moves.
    Bringing in Shift Gear Genesect is hard, however Genesect's typing and defensive stats will give opportunities.

VI. Other Options

    Choice Specs is usable, however SpA download boosts are unreliable, and to make matters worse, Genesect not only can't get many outright OHKOs, but is outsped by anything over 99.
    Great movepool, but there's not that many other viable moves than what's been listed above.


VII. Checks and Counters

    Ho-Oh = Generally good check but it must watch out for a boosted explosion
    Blaziken/Mega Blaziken has a 4x resist Genesects STAB options, and outspeeds after one Speed Boost buff. After that, it gets a clean 1hko with its Fire Moves.
    Physical Genesect loathes Burns, as they neuter U-Turn, Iron Head, and other physical options
    Faster Scarfed Pokemon such as Palkia and Shaymin-S can outspeed and KO Genesect.
    Paralysis shuts Genesect down. Scarf Genesect loses out on its speed tier, and non scarf Genesect becomes easy pickings for any powerful attacker.
    Any powerful attacker which can tank a hit and fire off a powerful unresisted Stab move can survive and get a clean OHKO. Zekrom's bolt strike and Kyogre's Hydro Pump come to mind.
