<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is at 50% HP or less, its Attack and Special Attack are halved. Both stats return to normal if the wielder's HP goes back above 50%.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Defeatist hasn't just prevented <a href="/bw/pokemon/archeops">Archeops</a> from being overpowered, it has turned Archeops almost into a non-threat, due to its excessive frailty and vulnerability to many super effective attacks. It also discourages the use of Archeops's most powerful attack, <a href="/bw/moves/head_smash">Head Smash</a>. Sadly, it is the only ability Archeops can obtain, and while it is difficult to work around, it doesn't neuter Archeops entirely.</p>
