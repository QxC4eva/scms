Reduces damage from Fire-type moves by 50%. 

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fire-type attacks deal 50% damage against the wielder, and burn damage is 1/16 maximum HP per turn, rather than 1/8.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Taking half damage from Fire-type attacks is a situational ability, but could be a real life-saver for Pokemon that are normally weak to Fire. As it is, the only Pokemon that have access to Heatproof are <a href="/bw/pokemon/bronzor">Bronzor</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/bronzong">Bronzong</a>, both of which would much rather make use of their other ability, <a href="/bw/abilities/levitate">Levitate</a>, which gives them an immunity to the more common, and arguably more dangerous, Ground-type moves and <a href="/bw/moves/spikes">Spikes</a>. However, Heatproof could allow them to get a surprise KO on Fire-type Pokemon that would normally easily take them out, such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/infernape">Infernape</a> or <a href="/bw/pokemon/darmanitan">Darmanitan</a>.</p>
