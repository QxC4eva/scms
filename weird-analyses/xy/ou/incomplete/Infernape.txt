Moves
========

    Close Combat and Flare Blitz are strong STABs with good coverage.
    Flare Blitz has more power, while Fire Blast is an option if you don't like recoil, and want to do more damage to physically defensive stuff like Skarmory or Forretress. It also prevents King's Shield from causing an Attack drop. Overheat is also more likely to OHKO Aegislash but can leave you open to stuff like Dragonite setting up on you.
    HP Ice mandatory for Lando-T, also hits Garchomp, Dragonite and Gliscor the hardest.
    SE Thunder Punch with Iron Fist boost hits marginally harder than neutral STAB. Targets include Gyarados before Mega Evolving, Jellicent, Starmie and Tentacruel, while being best move for Mandibuzz and Keldeo.
    HP Ice/TPunch provide (weaker) Psuedo-BoltBeam coverage.
    U-turn for utility/scouting, frail psychic types.
    Mach Punch has a lot of RKing utility, checks BP Mega Luke, +1 Mega Gyarados and SD Bisharp, while preventing a speed tie with Terrakion & other 108s.
    HP Grass is an option for Rotom-W, and Grass Knot for other waters and Hippowdon.

Set Details
========

    Flare Blitz guarantees 2HKO on Mega-Venasaur after SR, while Fire Blast doesn't.
    44 SpA EVs guaratees OHKO on Gliscor, Lando-I and Dragonite after SR. Full investment would be required to OHKO Lando-T thanks 2 nerf.
    Iron Fist boosts T/Mach Punch and Blaze gives a strong finishing Fire move if running U-turn.
    Max speed is mandatory to tie other 108s like Terrakion and outspeeding stuff like Garchomp.

Usage Tips
========

    Nice coverage and speed tier allows Infernape to threaten and KO a handful of stuff.
    Best played as an early-game hole-puncher to allow late-game sweepers to clean up.
    But can also clean up late-game if given the opportunity.
    Recoil makes it easily worn down with passive damage, especially with Flare Blitz.

Team Options
========

    Sun - Char-Y
    Rotom-W resists 3 of Infernape's weaknesses and switches into Talonflame, Azumarill and Mega-Pinsir, who threaten Infernape with SE priority.
    Sub Kyurem-B with Fusion Bolt and Thundurus-I can deal with bulky waters, especially Rotom-W, that Infernape struggle with.
    Late-game sweepers like Mega-Lucario, Mega-Pinsir, Mega-Zard X, Talonflame, DD Dragonite, SD Garchomp, who appreciate Infernape wearing down their checks.
