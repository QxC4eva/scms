<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder's HP reaches or falls below 25%, then the next move has its accuracy increased by 20%. This Berry has no effect on Guillotine, Sheer Cold, Fissure, or Horn Drill. Consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>If this Berry happened to work with OHKO moves, it would be great. Well, since OHKO moves are banned regardless, it wouldn't be that great, but it would be pretty good in any environment where they were allowed, such as VGC or Battle Subway. As it stands, though, there are very few moves that are so powerful regardless of accuracy that they would merit the use of the item slot for Micle Berryâ€”even sleep moves like GrassWhistle and Hypnosis are pointless when you could just use a Pokemon with a better sleep-inducing move if you were that desperate.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This item can be received from the Dream World in Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 after registering for the Japanese All-Star Cup Tournament or found on the Share Shelf of a player who has registered in the past.</p>
