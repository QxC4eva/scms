Prevents flinching.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder cannot flinch. Does not prevent the turn loss if the user is attacked while charging <a href="/bw/moves/focus_punch">Focus Punch</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Inner Focus has a very wide distribution, but in OU, most Pokemon with access to it have better options. The main selling point of Inner Focus is canceling <a href="/bw/moves/fake_out">Fake Out</a>'s flinching, a common move on leads. <a href="/bw/pokemon/mienshao">Mienshao</a> can take advantage of this when employed as a lead, but will often prefer <a href="/bw/abilities/regenerator">Regenerator</a>'s healing effect or <a href="/bw/abilities/reckless">Reckless</a>'s added power.</p>

<p>However, in the VGC environment, where Fake Out and <a href="/bw/moves/rock_slide">Rock Slide</a> are very common, Inner Focus is a very useful ability. If you seem to always be at the mercy of quick Fake Outs and Rock Slide flinches, consider testing an Inner Focus Pokemon to put those woes behind you.</p>
