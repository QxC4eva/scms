Overview
########

Blaziken takes the title of being the first,and currently only, starter to be banished from the lower tiers to ubers thanks to its dream world ability Speed Boost. Speed boost is the sole reason it became Ubers material. With it, Blaziken is able to outspeed and KO many threats and pass on boosts to the rest of the team. Blaziken now makes its second debut ibut now with a new boon: a mega evolution. Blaziken continues to be a formidable threat to watch out for. With its new 100 base speed, it is able to out speed much of the base 90 ubers metagame. However, Blaziken isn't held to only utilizing it's mega evolution. Life orb and leftovers variants have utility in its wall breaking and baton pass sets respectively. Life orb Blaziken actually does a bit more damage than it's mega counterpart. Leftovers provide healing and can be used in conjunction with protect to get health and a speed boost.

However, everything is not as perfect as it may seem for the speedy chicken. It doesn't have a diverse move pool and has paltry defensive stats allowing it to be easily revenged killed by priority moves. The weather nerf has also weakened Blaziken to an extent. It is not able to have the support of ever-present sun from Groudon as it now only lasts 5 turns instead of all battle. As such, Blaziken has limited turns with access to sun-boosted flare blitz. It even requires stealth rocks to be set up to deal with Ho-Oh, Multiscale Lugia, and Defensive Yveltal all of which can normally come in and deal with it . These factors shouldn't discount Blaziken's usefulness. With proper switch in and set up, Blaziken is still a formidable threat to look out for.


Offensive
########
name: Blaze is Back
move 1: Low Kick
move 2: Flare Blitz
move 3: Swords Dance / Protect
move 4: Knock Off / Protect
ability: Speed Boost
item: Blazikinite / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

    Flare Blitz provides a reliable and powerful physical fire-type STAB.
    Low Kick hits most of the Ubers metagame for base 120 and in conjunction with Flare Blitz you can hit most of the tier for neutral damage. It is used over High Jump Kick on Swords Dance sets.
    High Jump Kick can be an alternative to Low Kick. It offers 130 base power but if it misses, Blaziken deal massive damage to itself. It is a situational option as it only does damage to Quagsire which rarely sees use in Ubers.
    Swords Dance allows you to get a quick +2 to attack to massively increase damage output.
    Protect allows not only guranteed speed boosts, but also allows you to scout what move your opponent is going for.
    Knock off is another great utility move as it allows Blaziken to deal massive damage to direct resists to Flare Blitz and Low Kick in both Girantina forms. It also allows you to catch your opponent on a switch and lets you take off an otherwise useful item from the Pokemon they switch into.
    Baton pass can be used in this set to provide speed boosts for other team members when Blaziken is low. Make sure to use Protect with it as it gurantees speed boosts.
    Stone edge can be used instead of Knock off if your team is lacking against Ho-oh. It also dents Lugia and physically defensive Yveltal.


Set Details
========

    252 attack and 252 speed allow Mega Blaziken to come in and immediately get to work, attacking anything your opponent throws at you.
    The slashes represent two possible sets that you can run: Protect + 3 attacks or Swords Dance and Protect with 2 attacks.
    Jolly is used in order to boost Blaziken's speed and allow it to out speed scarfers such as Zekrom after one boost in its mega evolution or after two in its life orb set.
    Adamant can be used over Jolly so that your moves can deal more damage which allows you to OHKO Pokemon such as Kyogre not normally OHKO'd by Jolly.
    Life Orb Blaziken actually deals a bit more damage than it's mega evolution. It also allows you to use another Pokemon that has a mega that benefits your team.


Usage Tips
========

    Be wary about flat out switching Blaziken in as it has relatively low 80/80/80(mega) or 80/70/70(regular) bulk which means that it takes heavy damage from everything and can possibly get OHKO'd if your not careful.
    Protect allows you to gain +1 from speed boost to build momentum. It offers added utility in allowing you to see what move your opponent was going for and allows you to utilize that information to your advantage.
    Don't just spam Flare Blitz blindly as the recoil racks up quickly and can leave Blaziken fairly vulnerable to revenge killers. Your opponent can take advantage of this by switching into a resist which gradually increases the recoil with not much damage to them while adding to your recoil.
    Watch out for priority moves that can revenge kill you such as extreme speed on arceus and Rayquaza.


Team Options
========

    Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rocks as Blaziken enjoys the damage from it done to Lugia, Ho-h, and Yveltal.
    Groudon can be used to help Mega Blaziken by setting up the sun and dispelling the rain. It allows Flare Blitz to do more damage. Also checks Ekiller Arceus as it can take hits and retaliate with an attack or thunder wave.
    Landorus-T provides intimidate support and checks Ho-oh which counters Blaziken.
    Yveltal can wall break many of the Pokemon that can wall Blaziken such as Giratina forms.
    Xerneas can be used as another offensive sweeper and able to deal with both Giratina forms.
    Palkia is a great team member as it can sponge water moves thrown at Blaziken and deal with Rayquaza that can revenge kill Blaziken.
    U-turn/Volt Switch users such as Landorus that can get Blaziken a free switch.
    E-killer Arceus can be a good team member as well. Blaziken is able to weaken the opponent's team by KOing or debilitating Arceus's checks. This allows Arceus to come in and sweep.



Baton Pass
########
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Protect
move 3: Substitute / Roar
move 4: Flare Blitz
ability: Speed Boost
item: Leftovers
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

    Baton Pass used to pass on the boosts you gain to another team member for use.
    Protect allows you to gain guranteed speed increases from Blaziken's ability.
    Substitute used in conjunction with Protect allows you the best option in getting speed boosts as you can alternate between them which allows Blaziken to get the boosts without fearing much damage.
    Roar is an interesting option that allows you prevent Blaziken from being phazed out and losing its speed boosts. It also prevents opponent Pokemon from setting up on you.
    Flare Blitz provides a reliable and powerful physical fire-type STAB that allows you to deal with opposing Pokemon with taunt.


Set Details
========

    252 Hp and 252 Speed allow Blaziken to switch in, use a protect and begin to outspeed the opponent while having respectable bulk to take a few hits while setting up.
    A Jolly nature is used here to make sure that you are able to use substitute after your first Protect. This prevents Blaziken from taking severe damage or even being completely Knocked out.
    The attack investment makes sure that Blaziken is not a sitting duck to set up sweepers.
    Leftovers is used for healing and to increase longevity. It works great in conjunction with protect as you get a speed boost and +6.25% recovery.


Usage Tips
========

    Watch out for potential taunt users such as Deoxys-S as they can cripple this entire set as you wont be able to pass on your speed boosts.
    Protect is the cornerstone of this set allowing you to stay in and get speed boosts.
    A good strategy is to come and and use protect to get a speed boost. Then alternate to Substitute and continue to do so to pass your speed to another Pokemon.
    Roar is used mainly to prevent Blaziken from being phazed out. It is faster than phazers after one speed boost, so its Roar will go first and prevent it from being switched out.
    Watch out for priority moves that can deal with you such as Extremespeed and Shadow Sneak.


Team Options
========

    Groudon can be used to help boost Blaziken's Flare Blitz by setting up the sun and dispelling the rain. It allows Flare Blitz to do more damage. Sun support also lowers damage from water moves.
    You can Baton Pass your speed boosts to terrifying offensive Pokemon with low speed. includes:
        Life Orb and Choice Band Zekrom
        Mega Kangaskhan
        Life orb and Tank Ho-Oh.
        Lustrous Orb and Life Orb Palkia
        Choice Specs Kyogre
        Choice Band Groudon


Other Options
########

    Brave Bird can be utilized. However, the only common threats it hits for super effective damage are Mega Mewtwo-X and Arceus fighting. Both take massive damage from Flare Blitz as is. Otherwise, Brave Bird is another recoil move that shouldn't really be used over any other moves in the set.
    Rock slide can be used, but its main target is Ho-oh. Stone edge should be used for more damage to Yveltal and Lugia.
    Shadow claw can be used instead of Knock off since it deals less damage to Mega Gengar and Giratina-O. However, you don't have it's secondary effects against other opponent Pokemon.
    Boosting moves such as Swords Dance and Bulk up can be used in the Baton Passing set but have a marginal or nonexistent bonus for special attackers and take more turns to set up.
    Overheat can be used in the Baton Pass set to cut down on Recoil damage. But repeated usage causes it to deal less damage and it also has a chance to miss.
    Choice Band can be used to grant Blaziken an immediate power boost, but it constricts it and doesn't help out speed boost at all.



Checks & Counters
########

    Both Giratina forms can take anything Blaziken throws at them except for boosted Knock Off and are able to eventually KO it or phaze it out.
    Physically Defensive Arceus Fairy and Water can take a few hits. They also resist one of Blaziken's STABs each, but can't stay in on repeated use of the other STAB that they don't resist.
    Landorus-Therian can switch in and take a hit with Defensive investment and Intimidate, although it doesn't appreciate boosted Flare Blitz.
    Quagsire with Unaware can ignore Blaziken's stat boosts and attack back with it's water and earth STABs. It doesn't fare well against High Jump Kick though.
    Phazers that are able to Whirlwind/Roar/Dragon tail the Baton Pass set.
    Pokemon that have Prankster such as Thundurus and Klefki. They can use Thunder wave which cripples the offensive set. Taunt from Thundurus shuts down the BP set.
    Poison limits the amount of time Blaziken can stay in by adding and increasing damage each turn on it.
    Revenge Killers such as Arceus-Normal and Rayquaza with extreme speed are able to revenge kill Blaziken with its paltry bulk and with prior damage.
