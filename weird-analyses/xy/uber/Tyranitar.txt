Overview
########
- Typing + Sand Stream + Pursuit = a brand of support unique to itself
- Checks and/or traps top metagame threats like Yveltal/Gengar/Ho-Oh
- Being able to trap and remove Mega Gengar is a huge plus
- One of the few good users of Stealth Rock in the tier
- Sand supports the team in many ways, from providing valuable chip damage to anti-leading common suicide leads to accommodating sand abusers
- Fairies are not good for it
- Fares badly against other weather starters barring Abomasnow
- Gained a new Mega Evolution but sadly cannot make much use of it as it sorely needs its item slot
- New and horrifying threats in Mega Mewtwo X/Mega Blaziken/Mega Lucario
- Many weaknesses and no reliable recovery

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Pursuit
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Stone Edge / Roar
ability: Sand Stream
item: Leftovers / Chople Berry / Lum Berry
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========
- SR since it learns it + can set it up against common stuff it checks (Yveltal, Ho-Oh)
- Pursuit is a big part of what gives Tyranitar its niche. Allows it to trap Mega Gengar, Mewtwo (Mega Y), Kyogre locked into Ice Beam/Thunder, Ho-Oh that decide it is in their best interest to flee
- Toxic is great for putting support Arceus on a timer, lets Tyranitar beat certain CM Arceus, and bothers stuff in general 
- Stone Edge for Ho-Oh and Yveltal and is strong STAB in general; it is Tyranitar's most hard-hitting option
- Roar can phaze Ho-Oh, very reliable way of damaging it with Stealth Rock up, also prevents Tyranitar from becoming total Geoxern bait
- Slot 4: Superpower hits Darkrai, great in conjunction with Lum Berry. Also, it punishes Ekiller for setting up on Tyranitar and hits Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Dialga super effectively

Set Details
========
- Max HP and SpD for maximum durability on the special side, making use of the SpD boost from sandstorm
- Careful nature maximises SpD at the cost of Tyranitar's unused SpA
- 24 EVs in Atk lets Stone Edge OHKO 4/0 Yveltal after Stealth Rock; consider siphoning these EVs from SpD into Atk
- Leftovers gives Tyranitar a little more wiggle room to switch in. Chople lets Tyranitar trap Gengar/Mewtwo (Y) even if they have Fighting coverage. Note that Tyranitar's 4x weakness to Fighting-types mean Chople will be doing little in the way of cushioning it from physical Fighting-type attacks, especially STABed ones. Lum has decreased in effectiveness but is still good for letting Tyranitar shrug off status in a pinch, such as a Sacred Fire burn it really doesn't want, or beat Darkrai 1v1
- Shuca Berry allows Tyranitar to take EQ from weakened Groudon/Landorus-T/Gliscor and pick them off (Ice Beam snipes the latter 2, if it is used)
 
Usage Tips
========
- No reliable recovery, keep this in mind when making switches as Tyranitar will gradually be worn down.
- Easily exploited because of its poor speed and many weaknesses; be careful about staying in if Pokemon like Blaziken/Mega Mewtwo X are around unless you can pick them off on the switch. Also be careful of predicted double switches into these threats. 
- On the other hand, don't be excessively conservative. For example, if the opponent's Kyogre has been found to be Choiced and the Ice Beam/Thunder is imminent, switching Tyranitar in to Pursuit it would be nice
- Can function as an effective lure with the appropriate item/move. See OO.
- If you see Gengar/Mewtwo (Y) and are running Chople, keep Tyranitar healthy as you can trap these with a good amount of health to spare; you need to be healthy to do this though
- Lead with this vs Deo S/(A if running Chople; 0 Atk Low Kick does not kill)/Scoli leads, pretty good anti-lead to common suicide leads in conjunction with sand

Team Options
========
- Cleric support highly recommended because of how status-prone it is. Fairies are good partners, offering good defensive synergy and appreciating Pursuit support against Mega Gengar.
- Wish support is also nice as Tyranitar lacks reliable recovery. Sylveon is a great partner that provides both Wish and Heal Beal support. Jirachi is another solid partner that helps against Fairies while Tyranitar checks Yveltal/Ho-Oh for it; note that this compounds your Ground weakness though
- Flying types/Levitators to check Earthquake spam, these also mitigate the Fighting weakness
- Fairy check; Scizor is good, as is Bronzong (try not to compound the Ground weakness)
- Kyogre check; Grasseus is a good one, having excellent synergy with Tyranitar. It also checks other problematic Pokemon in Palkia and Groudon. That said, Palkia is also a good Kyogre check
- Palkia is another problem; support Arceus that fare well against it are good partners that can provide hazard removal as well
- Have Pokemon to deal with common support Arceus formes that can come out on top of Tyranitar with Recover + Will-O-Wisp/Toxic
- Ghostceus is a good partner to handle Fighting-types/Mega Kangaskhan. Tyranitar helps it with Ho-Oh/Yveltal.
- Sweepers to take advantage of its Pursuit trapping utility
- Sand abusers are naturally good partners. Sand Rush Excadrill is really the only ubers-viable one though

Other Options
########

- Crunch for consistent damage output, allows for mindgames with Pursuit. Payback for greater damage most of the time but is inferior now and then vs Pokemon like Bronzong
- Ice Beam hits Grounds, notably smacking Landorus-T and Gliscor for 4x damage (it does not OHKO them even with a Sassy nature though). Earthquake hits Dialga/Heatran
- Tyranitarite: support Mega Tyranitar boasts added bulk and power that allows it to fare better against Ekiller among other stuff; however the item slot is sorely missed and you use your Mega slot. A decent Dragon Dance set can be run, with Stone Edge and Crunch as STAB moves and Taunt/Ice Beam in the last slot (Tyranitar learns Taunt!). Note that it is hard to find setup opportunities with its many weaknesses, Mega Tyranitar will really only be setting up on Yveltal, since it fears burns from support Arceus and Ho-Oh. Note that using any Mega Tyranitar expends your team's Mega slot. For QC: should I make one of these a main set?
- Smooth Rock extends Sandstorm turns from 5-8; considering how deadly a +2 Speed Excadrill is, this is a possible option
- Thunder Wave punishes overzealous Geoxern while remaining a good option for crippling CM Arceus
- Focus Sash anti-lead
- Fire Blast hits Scizor on the switch and fries Ferro/Forry
- Tyranitar's movepool is quite extensive; unfortunately it is often hard-pressed to spare the moveslot(s)

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: These are especially threatening because Tyranitar is 4x weak to their STAB moves. Among these, Mega Mewtwo X and Fightceus stand out as prime counters as they aren't weak to any of Tyranitar's moves and can instantly OHKO/severely cripple it. Terrakion and Lucario can switch in on anything bar Superpower or Earthquake and threaten massively with STAB Close Combat. Blaziken does not want to switch in on Stone Edge but is incredibly dangerous if it manages to come in safely, or as a revenge killer.

**Fairies**: Xerneas, Fairyceus, Sylveon, Klefki, Clefable are not weak to any of Tyranitar's moves and can switch in very comfortably if healthy, proceeding to threaten Tyranitar (Xern hits hard and sets up, Fairyceus has reliable recovery and can potentially set up, Sylveon and Clefable have reliable recovery and status removal, Klefki can set Spikes)

**Ground-types**: Groundceus is a counter that can set up on Tyranitar with Swords Dance and possibly Recover, making it particularly threatening amongst these. Hippowdon and Quagsire are more defensively-inclined counters that also have reliable healing. Groudon can switch in on anything bar Ice Beam, which it can also take in a pinch, and force Tyranitar out with the threat of Earthquake. Gliscor and Landorus-T can also do this but are doubly threatened by Ice Beam. None of these Pokemon barring Gliscor like Toxic, however.

**STAB U-Turn**: The 2 viable users of STAB U-Turn in Ubers, Scizor and Genesect, can use the move to build momentum or else cripple/kill Tyranitar. However, both of them don't want to be switching in on Tyranitar's STAB moves, although they can take a hit in a pinch. They have to be wary of possible Fire-type coverage, too.

**Skarmory**: Roost, Toxic, and access to Stealth Rock and Spikes allow it to dick around with Tyranitar

**Ferrothorn**: loses to Fire-type coverage and dislikes Superpower greatly, but can otherwise switch into Tyranitar and set up hazards/use Leech Seed. It is immune to Toxic as well, and Tyranitar is weak to both its STABs.

**Mega Kangaskhan**: Does not like Superpower, but can switch into any single attack and threaten back with Earthquake. PuP/Drain Punch variants annihilate Tyranitar

**Status**: Burn and poison subject Tyranitar to a slow death as it does not have reliable recovery. Burns also further debilitate it by weakening its physical attacks

**Kyogre**: Changes the weather and can proceed to force it out with STAB Water-type moves. Does not like switching in, however

**Support Arceus**: Waterceus, Grasseus, and Steelceus can come out on top of Tyranitar relatively unscathed if it is not running Toxic

**Palkia**: Lustrous Orb variants can 2HKO Tyranitar but will come out of the scuffle severely crippled. STAB Water-type moves, as well as Toxic/Rest if run, are problematic for Tyranitar. It doesn't want to be switching in if need be, though.

**Fighting-type coverage**: Pokemon running Focus Blast as coverage can seriously dent, if not kill Tyranitar not holding Chople Berry (also note Chople is one-use). Darkrai, Ghostceus, MMY, and Kyurem-W are viable users of the move. Low Kick on Deoxys-A, Brick Break on SD Ghostceus, and Superpower on opposing Tyranitar are other such moves that Tyranitar has to look out for.
