<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. For every consecutive turn that this move is used by at least one Pokemon, this move's power is multiplied by the number of turns to pass, but not more than 5. Pokemon with the ability Soundproof are immune. This move will only reach a maximum Base Power of 200.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Echoed Voice has little competitive use for a few reasons. First, it starts at a paltry 40 Base Power, meaning even with STAB, it will not do much damage. Furthermore, Pokemon with access to this move would rather not use a Normal-type moves: Nidoking prefers elemental coverage moves, Slowbro hardly has a moveslot open, etc. It also requires that the user not switch out and survive whatever comes its way, which is not an easy thing to do in the current metagame.</p>
