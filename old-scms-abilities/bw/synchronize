<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If another Pokemon inflicts burn, paralysis, poison, or bad poison on the wielder, then the enemy receives the same status. Self-induced status is not passed on. Poison and bad poison from <a href="/bw/moves/toxic_spikes">Toxic Spikes</a> is not passed to the foe. Synchronize will not inflict status on Pokemon immune to that particular status. Synchronize will not successfully inflict status previously transferred by <a href="/bw/moves/psycho_shift">Psycho Shift</a>.</p>

<p>When the wielder is first in the party (even if it is fainted) when entering battle against a wild Pokemon, there is a 50% chance of making the wild Pokemon's nature correspond to the nature of the Pokemon with this ability.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Synchronize does see some use in the form of <a href="/bw/pokemon/mew">Mew</a>. However, Mew is not seen as much as some people first expected when it was brought down from Ubers, even though it is a perfectly viable Pokemon. Other Pokemon with Synchronize such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/gardevoir">Gardevoir</a> have better abilities such as <a href="/bw/abilities/trace">Trace</a>, so really outside of Mew it isn't seen much, and doesn't have that much competitive use.</p>
