<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Grass Knot was once a staple on most Grass-types in OU thanks to common heavyweights that shared a Grass-type weakness such as Tyranitar, Suicune, and many others. The variable power often presented problems, so more reliable options were still used. Today, the move is less common due to the ubiquitous Ferrothorn (who has a 4x resistance to Grass-type attacks) and Rotom-W, the most common Water-type, taking negligible damage from it. For those reasons, Energy Ball and Giga Drain are favored due to their consistency in normal situations. Nevertheless, it's still a good option while sandstorm is in play to hit Tyranitar and Terrakion harder.</p>
