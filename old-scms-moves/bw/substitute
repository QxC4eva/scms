[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user loses 1/4 of its max HP and creates a Substitute. This Substitute takes damage for the user and blocks most non-damaging moves, such as Spore and Thunder Wave. It also prevents the secondary effects of damaging moves from taking an effect, including preventing the user from being forced out by Circle Throw or Dragon Tail. The user still takes normal damage from weather and status effects while behind its Substitute. If the Substitute breaks during a multi-hit attack, the user will take damage from any remaining hits. This move fails if the user does not have enough HP remaining to create a Substitute, or if it already has a Substitute.</p>

<p>If the Substitute takes damage equal to or greater than 25% of the user's HP, it will disappear (the user's defensive stats are used in damage calculation). OHKO moves will always break a Substitute. A Substitute is capable of being Baton Passed. Does not prevent damage from pre-existing status conditions. Draining moves break the Substitute and restore HP. Recoil moves do not cause the user damage if used against a Substitute. If the user switches out, the Substitute is lost.</p>

<p>The ability Anger Point does not activate with Substitute up. The ability Intimidate is blocked by Substitute. The user is damaged by Life Orb if it hits a Substitute. Does not prevent a Pokemon with the ability Pickpocket from stealing an item from the Pokemon with Substitute; however, if the Pickpocket user itself has a Substitute, it cannot steal any items. If a Pokemon with the ability Mummy has a Substitute, its ability does not activate when it hits the Substitute. Blocks Sky Drop entirely. Prevents the secondary effect of Smack Down from occurring. The ability Infiltrator does not bypass Substitute. Does not prevent the user's Air Balloon from popping if the Substitute is hit. If a Pokemon with the ability Illusion uses Substitute and the Substitute is broken, the Illusion does not fade. Prevents Clear Smog's effect from working. If a Pokemon with Substitute attacks a Pokemon with the abilities Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, or Rocky Helmet, the effect damage bypasses the Substitute and goes straight to the attacker. Reflect does not reduce Brick Break's damage if the target has a Substitute up.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of Substitute. For just 25% HP, your Pokemon can enjoy a safeguard against weaker attacks, immunity to status effects, and a protective barrier that puts your opponent under a lot of pressure to attack. The uses of Substitute are endless, but there are definitely a few that stand out. For one, there's the classic SubPunch combo, in which Substitute greatly eases the amount of prediction needed to use Focus Punch: simply use Substitute on an obvious switch and start firing off ultra-powerful Fighting-type attacks as the opponent tries to respond. Substitute can also work well on a number of defensive Pokemon. Alongside Protect, it is the bread and butter for Toxic-stalling Gliscor and Stallrein. Continually using Protect and Substitute as the opponent takes escalating chip damage can be devastating for your opponent while your Pokemon remains perfectly safe. Finally, a simple Substitute + three attacks set can prove surprisingly effective on all kinds of sweepers. There are a variety of uses for Substitute and many more pop up all the time!</p>
