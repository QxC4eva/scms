<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Poisons the target. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Poison Gas is not a good move mostly because of the existence of Toxic, which is not only more accurate and more available, as almost all Pokemon are capable of learning it through a TM, but the toxic poison status that Toxic inflicts is undoubtedly more desirable than the regular poison inflicted by Poison Gas. Of course, Poison Gas does hit all opponents in a double battle and all adjacent foes in a triple battle, but in those circumstances there are much more potent status conditions to use regardless. Also, Toxic Spikes does a better job of reliably poisoning all the foes on the opponent's team in one stroke, barring those that are already out.</p>
