<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the accuracy of all moves used by the wielder by 30%. This is a multiplicative increase, not additive, meaning if a move has 50% accuracy before Compoundeyes, it is brought to 65% (0.5 * 1.3) total accuracy afterward. When a Pokemon with this ability is first in the party, wild Pokemon will have a higher chance of holding an item.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This ability is useful on Pokemon with low-accuracy moves, and fortunately, many of the Pokemon with this ability have low-accuracy moves to exploit. <a href="/bw/pokemon/galvantula">Galvantula</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/butterfree">Butterfree</a> are possibly the most well-known of these; Galvantula can make great use of a 91% accurate <a href="/bw/moves/thunder">Thunder</a>, while Butterfree can use a 97.5% accurate <a href="/bw/moves/sleep_powder">Sleep Powder</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/stun_spore">Stun Spore</a>.</p>
