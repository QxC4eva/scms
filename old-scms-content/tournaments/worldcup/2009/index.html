<p>Congratulations to our winning team, team OCEANIA! With an intense tiebreaker win, team Oceania has stopped the Asians reign as champions and firmly established themselves as the best PokeNation in the world! Come back next year to see who will possibly overthrow those pesky OCNs. Thanks everyone for a great tournament, I hope you enjoyed it, I know I did. Hope to see you again next year!</p>

<p>Its time for the finals and let me congratulate the two teams who made it this far, Asia and Oceania! Asia's now back to full force and I'm rooting for my team to take it all... yet again!</p>

<p>Round 3 is here! We had an exciting round 2 with asia coming back from 1-3 down to win 5-3 and with west going 5-0! This round looks like a monster and I still think asia will pull through despite over half our men being away!</p>

<p>Round 2 is up! I'm really happy to see that we completed 164/168 battles, thats just an amazing achievement! Thanks for making this tournament the best one ever, I'm sure we're going to have an exciting round of 8!</p>

<p>The Qualifying Round is officially underway! All the divisions look stellar, it should be a real pleasure to watch some of these battles unfold. Good luck to all teams, I'll be seeing you in the final 8 ;)</p>

<p>Welcome to the World Cup of Pokémon IV! We've got a great tournament in store for you this year and, personally, I think this will be the best World Cup yet.</p>

<p>For people who haven't participated or witnessed a World Cup before, I'd suggest you look through <a href="http://pokewc.bravehost.com/">last year's</a> tournament. Even though this year's format has been changed around, that should introduce you to the tournament!</p>

<p>I suggest everyone looks around the website, especially at the <a href="format">Format</a> page, because it's been completely revamped.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's to what should be a great tournament and I hope you all have fun! (And that Asia wins again!)</p>

<p>Oh, also, Asia's gonna be as awesome as ever! Can't say the same for Canada though&mdash;I think they may not even go past the qualifiers!</p>

<p>Get ready for a great tournament, because this will be the best World Cup yet: I guarantee it.   However, that cannot happen unless you all play your part. It's time to get those flags out, get excited, and get smack talking... that's where the fun lies. I urge everyone to show Smogon what their country is made of... as we <strong>definitely</strong> do not want Asia winning again! Heh!</p>

<p>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Shiv, as he has been a great help, more than ever, in contributing to the success of this tournament. His country is pretty mediocre, however.</p>

<p>Good luck to all participants, and remember, FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY!</p>
