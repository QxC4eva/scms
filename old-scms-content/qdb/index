<p>Hello and welcome to the Smogon Quote Database. Any trainer who loves his Pokémon will tell you that a good sense of humor is essential. While there's no such thing as a Pokémon, we at Smogon do have a sense of humor and we're here to prove it.</p>

<p>Throughout Netbattle, Shoddy, Pokemon SHOWDOWN!, or IRC sessions, there are always memorable things said by certain users, and the purpose of this database is to record the most memorable funny quotes. Any user is free to browse our quote database, vote for their favorites, or add some new ones if they wish. For those who use NetBattle, there is an image uploading feature so that you can upload screenshots of amusing user info.</p>

<p>While I'm a fun-loving chap, there are some rules here everyone must follow. If you believe rules exist to be broken, then likewise, I believe bans exist to be given.</p>

<ul>
<li>Refrain from submitting extremely long quotes. There are some exceptions, but usually a huge log is not fun to read at all.</li>
<li>As a general rule, don't submit inside jokes that only a couple of people will get. A completely new user might not understand every single one of our quotes, but for the most part they are very straight to the point. The purpose of this site is not to amuse a couple of hardcore fans, but to appeal to the general Smogon population.</li>
<li>This may seem like common sense, but... be very careful when reporting quotes. This feature should rarely have to be used as we look through each quote before accepting it, but some people insist on reporting quotes simply because they don't like them or because they feel like reporting the whole bloody page for the sake of being a dick. Don't do this. I can't stress this enough. A first offense will get you a vital organ removed. Then I may move on to infractions.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's all for now. Enjoy the quotes and images, for the love of all that's holy don't submit lolcats, and above all, have fun!</p>
