########
- Got a buff with a couple new viable toys - Drill Run, Knock Off, and Assault Vest
- Though losing Ghost- and Dark-type resists, 105 SpD and Assault Vest makes Escavalier a prime candidate of a Pokemon that can take on special attackers such as Gengar.
- All three of its abilities really aren't bad and can be molded to the player's needs.
- Rise of the fairies really gives Escavalier a chance to shine.
- Drill Run and STAB Megahorn, as well as great durability without much investment, gives it an edge over Genesect and Scizor. Being slower than Mixed Aegislash also has its perks.
- x4 weakness to Fire-type moves makes it very exploitable as Fire is extremely common in OU.
- Its entire moveset is shut down by Charizard, Talonflame, and Rotom-H. Bear in mind that Mega Charizard-X does become vulnerable to Drill Run.
- Slow despite its Pokedex description of it flying at high speeds. I wish I was joking:

SET NAME
########
name: En Garde!
move 1: Iron Head
move 2: Megahorn
move 3: Drill Run
move 4: Knock Off / Pursuit
item: Assault Vest
nature: Brave
ability: Overcoat
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe

Moves
========
- Iron Head is the most mandatory STAB for Escavalier. It allows Escavalier to plow through Fairy-types and has decent coverage with Dark-type attacks.
- Megahorn is kept due to its high base power while being backed by STAB.
- Drill Run harms switch-ins such as Mega Mawile, Mega Lucario, Heatran, and Charizard-X.
- Knock Off and Pursuit allow Escavalier to be very annoying to switch out of. Knock Off punishes opponents switching in or out with the potential loss of an item. With Pursuit a fleeing Pokemon takes a good chunk of health. This allows Escavalier to take on threats such as Gengar and Alakazam.

Set Details
========
- Brave with the given nature spread maximizes Escavalier's Attack while allowing Escavalier to be slower than Mixed Aegislash. 248 HP helps with residual damage with the remainder of EVs going to SpD.
- All three of its abilities have great merits.
- Overcoat lets Escavalier block Spore and Sleep Powder from Breloom and Mega Venusaur. It also makes Escavalier immune to Hail to help counter Abomasnow and its Mega Evolution.
- Swarm is great for situations where Escavalier is put into dangerous health levels. This allows Megahorn to hit very hard and practically punish many switch-ins; even those that resist it.
- Shell Armor is the weakest of the three options; however, it completely prevents critical hits in the process.
- With Escavalier's lower HP and higher SpD, it is best to invest in max HP instead of SpD. Below are two calculations for examples:

252 SpA Life Orb Gengar Shadow Ball vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Assault Vest Escavalier: 109-130 (31.6 - 37.7%) -- 90.9% chance to 3HKO
252 SpA Life Orb Gengar Shadow Ball vs. 4 HP / 252 SpD Assault Vest Escavalier: 87-105 (30.8 - 37.2%) -- 78.4% chance to 3HKO

The differences of investing in more SpD is very minor when you also consider Escavalier would appreciate the extra HP to take some physical attacks easier.
- You can try for a bulkier spread, but Escavalier specializes in doing hefty amounts of damage while being utilitarian.

Usage Tips
========
- Assault Vest Escavalier has a dual purpose. Much like Assault Vest Conkeldurr and Assault Vest Tyranitar, the goal is to absorb Special Attacks with relative ease while punishing the opposing Pokemon in the process.
- Some examples of Pokemon that Escavalier can switch into include Greninja, Gengar, Alakazam, Celebi, Espeon, Starmie, Sylveon, and many more. Bear in mind that if any of these Pokemon carry Hidden Power Fire it does make the situation complicated.
- Despite the x4 weakness, un-STAB Fire-type attacks can still be taken from some Pokemon. For example, +1 Flamethrower from bulky Clefable fails to OHKO Escavalier while Iron Head will do 65.9% damage. Magneton also fails to OHKO with Hidden Power Fire.
- In dire emergencies Escavalier can be used to check Special Mega Lucario. +2 Aura Sphere does 80% max while Drill Run does 78% minimum. Physical Mega Lucario should be avoided at all costs.
- Since Escavalier will force a lot of switches, you may have to predict what is coming out. For example, using Drill Run when Heatran is expected to come in will heavily reward Escavalier and its teammates.


Team Options
========
- Escavalier is not really a Pokemon you build a team around; however, if you desire to think of Pokemon that hate nuisance special sweepers and Ghost-types.
- Barring Aegislash with King's Shield, Terrakion really likes Escavalier as a teammate. Escavalier can eliminate hazardous threats such as Clefable and Gengar while Terrakion cleans up threats such as Skarmory.
- Slower set-up sweepers like Gyarados and others appreciate some of their checks and counters removed from the field. For example Gyarados does not appreciate Starmie and Celebi while Escavalier has almost no issues handling these Pokemon. In return Gyarados can check threats such as Mega Charizard-X and Y to an extent.
- Gastrodon is a good check as it handles a lot of the Pokemon that Escavalier can't face such as Rotom-H and Analytic Magnezone.
- A Wish passer such as Vaporeon works well with Escavalier as Vaporeon can harass some of Escavalier's checks and counters while Escavalier can dent some of its problematic Pokemon such as Celebi.
- Landorus-T can handle some of the Fire-types such as Talonflame and Charizard-X to an extent. Bear in mind that Landorus-T has to be fairly bulky to take on these threats.


Other Options
########
- Swords Dance can boost Escavalier's Attack greatly. Unfortunately, its mediocre movepool and pitiful Speed really hamper it from becoming a major threat with it.
- Choice Band Escavalier isn't a bad choice (hue); however, Assault Vest is probably the best item for Escavalier as it sets it apart from Genesect and Scizor.
- Escavalier's low Speed allows it to function in Trick Room. Life Orb with four attacks is very viable and, due to its very low Speed, has great use under Trick Room.


Checks & Counters
########
- Skarmory and Rotom-H are the two biggest counters to Escavalier. While neither enjoy Knock Off, they have different ways of harassing Escavalier through status, access to recovery, or powerful STAB attacks.
- Offensive threats such as Lucario and Genesect can switch into Escavalier's STABs and set up or harass Escavalier. Genesect and non-Mega Lucario needs to beware of Knock Off as losing their items can mean trouble. Special Mega Lucario also cannot switch into Escavalier as Escavalier can stomach +2 Aura Sphere.
- Gyarados can switch into both of its STABs. With Mega Evolution it can prevent the boosted BP from Knock Off as well as Mega Evolve to resist it. Mega Evolving does make Mega Gyarados prone to Megahorn, though.
- Talonflame has to be careful on receiving punishment, but Talonflame can easily scare off Escavalier with STAB Flare Blitz.
- Charizard, and Charizard-Y, easily resist all of Escavalier's attacks and doesn't take boosted damage from Knock Off. Mega Charizard-X can also handle Escavalier though has to be careful on facing Drill Run after Mega Evolution.
- Heatran is a Pokemon that can easily check Escavalier; however, countering it is a different story. For example, Air Balloon Heatran can switch into Drill Run constantly; however, any of Escavalier's other attacks will easily pop the balloon. Furthermore, non-Air Balloon Heatran have to beware of switching into Drill Run.
- Burns really screw up Escavalier. Will-O-Wisp from Rotom, Jellicent, Trevenant, and other Pokemon can really hamper Escavalier. Furthermore, Scald from bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon make it harder for Escavalier to switch-in and stay in safely.
