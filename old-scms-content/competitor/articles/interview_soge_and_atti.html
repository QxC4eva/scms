<div id="interview">

<div class="aside"><p>It was almost time for Valentine and CTC's match to commence, so I headed over to the lounge room for a cup of coffee, where I accidentally ran into yan[sogeking] and Atticus. I decided to take the opportunity to interview both of them.</p>

<p>I greeted yan[sogeking] with a cup of coffee. He gladly accepted the coffee and agreed to an interview.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Hey Sogeking. Thanks for allowing me to interview you. Congrats on making it into the semifinals! It must be pretty exciting making it this far.</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>Yea, I'm very excited about it; it's cool to see all the effort I put into it doing work. It will be even more difficult now.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>I was wondering what your thoughts were on your potential opponents in the semifinals.</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>CTC is the best in the world, Atticus is a legend himself, and although Valentine is the zebra (laughs), he has been doing pretty well, too.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Its nice to hear that you have some really nice things to say about everyone! Anyway, you probably had to get through some pretty tough battlers to make it this far. Any thoughts?</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>I'm pretty sure that if I had faced more experienced players in the beginning rounds I would have lost pretty bad. haha.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Although you are a pretty good battler, did you expect to get this far when you signed up?</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>Well, if the OST was hosted in BW OU, I would be inclined to say "yes". But as it's in XY OU, I really didn't expect it, as I only started taking XY serious after SPL, in which I was playing BW, ended.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>That makes you getting this far that much more exciting! So what do you think about XY OU? Do you like the tier?</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>To be honest, I was enjoying the tier more during the pre-Genesect and Mega Lucario ban metagame, but I still prefer the current XY OU metagame over BW OU. Keldeo is broken in BW haha.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>yan[sogeking] sits back and takes a sip of his coffee.</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>Sometimes it's a pain in the ass since many good battles are decided on 50/50 gambles, but it's part of the game, I guess.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Hah, I know what you mean about Keldeo. It still can give people trouble in XY but that perma rain made it a force to be reckoned with. Anyway, what do you think of your matchups in the tournament? Which matchup was your favorite?</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>Wait. Do you mean player matchups or battle matchups?</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Oh, I meant battle matchups.</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>I have enjoyed many of my battles during the tournament. I really can't choose a match up I enjoyed more.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>yan[sogeking] seemed lost in thought for a second while chugging down his coffee. Suddenly stopped drinking his coffee and stuck his tongue out as if he burnt it. I tried not to smirk.</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>I believe my favorite battle was my second against Philip7086. I also really liked my first match against Nysyr. My third battle against The PDC Show was great as well. They were all very intense games decided on late-game coinflips.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Speaking of coin flips, were there any upsets in the tournament? You know, besides the whole swag play thing making stone cold lose in round 1.</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>Well, upsets happen very often. Luckily in my matches, unexpected game-changing turns didn't happen much except in my matches against The PDC Show where in game 1 I got flinched by extrasensory and in game 3 I got a well-timed crit.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>I see. It goes to show how luck can decide a match regardless of skill.</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>But I believe the biggest upset was CTC beating Lizardons after a 0-1 start. In his second game, he needed to rely on Scald burning to turn the game around and in the last game, he managed to win a 400 turn stall war.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Oh wow, that's a lot of turns! Well anyway, I think we should start wrapping up. So if you win, what would be the first thing you would do?</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>If I win I will take a pic with me holding the trophy. :]</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>What no speech?</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>Well, I don't have much to say to be honest. Usually people dedicate it to users who have helped them practice and stuff, but the only one who helps me is papai noel, so I don't think it will be needed.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Sounds good. That actually leads to my final question quite nicely. Any final thoughts you would like to share with you're adoring fans?</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>BRASIL PORRA, HERE IS WORK. .kael</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>That's it. o_o</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>We could hear the people in the stadium cheering louder. We noticed that Valentine and CTC's match was about to begin. Neither of us wanted to miss the showdown so we started saying our farewells.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Haha nice. Well, I would like to thank you for your time. Good luck with the rest of the tournament!</p></div>

<div class="speaker soge"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_soge.png" alt="soge" /><p>Thanks.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>As I said farewell to sogeking, I realized that I still needed to interview Atticus. I approached Atticus and asked if he wanted to do a quick interview while watching the battle. He seemed a bit hesitant since he also wanted to watch the game, but ultimately agreed.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Hey, Atticus. Thanks for doing this interview with us and congrats on making it to the semifinals! It must be pretty exciting for you to make it this far.</p></div>

<div class="speaker atti"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_atti.png" alt="atti" /><p>Yeah, I honestly didn't expect to get this far but it's been a thrilling ride.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>I bet it was. You had to get by some tough battlers to get this far. Any thoughts?</p></div>

<div class="speaker atti"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_atti.png" alt="atti" /><p>With absolutely no offense towards the people I've faced, but I've had a relatively soft path to the semis compared to some of the other competitors. I got a bye, Oglemi and macle for m first 3 rounds, and well I wouldn't exactly say either of them are active in XY. The other guys have been very tough though and with some luck I've managed to overcome some great opposition.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Speaking of the other guys, what did you think of the other matchups through out the tournament? Were there any upsets?</p></div>

<div class="speaker atti"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_atti.png" alt="atti" /><p>You mean like upsets in my matches?</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>I mean like upsets in any match.</p></div>

<div class="speaker atti"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_atti.png" alt="atti" /><p>Ohh ok. Gr8stard losing was probably the biggest seeing as he was the pre-tournament favorite. If I'm being honest though, I haven't really been keeping track of tournament outside of like Round 5 and onward. I know my bros pana and phil lost early so I suppose I'll mention them.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>From the corner of our eyes, we could see the action going on in the field. It was pretty intense. I then attempted to focus on the interview so we can finish up before the match ends.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>So you are already aware of the other semifinalists. What are your thoughts on them?</p></div>

<div class="speaker atti"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_atti.png" alt="atti" /><p>CTC and Valentine are the best remaining players left if I'm being honest. CTC in particular is an excellent player and should be the favorite to win the entire thing but Pokemon is Pokemon so anything can happen. As for sogeking, I've known him for a long time and he was pretty mediocre when I was teammates with him in the World Cup. Since then though he's definitely stepped his game up and is now one of the better players.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>I see. So who would you think would be the toughest to beat?</p></div>

<div class="speaker atti"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_atti.png" alt="atti" /><p>CTC without a doubt, he's the only one left that actually makes his own teams lol.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Well if you managed to win the whole thing, what would be the first thing you would do?</p></div>

<div class="speaker atti"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_atti.png" alt="atti" /><p>Go to Disneyland.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Why Disneyland lol?</p></div>

<div class="speaker atti"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_atti.png" alt="atti" /><p>lol it was a joke, NFL players typically go there after they win the Super Bowl.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Haha you got me. Didn't think of that.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>Trying to hide my embarrassment for not getting the joke, I continued with the interview.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>So then you wouldn't really do anything special?</p></div>

<div class="speaker atti"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_atti.png" alt="atti" /><p>I'd fist pump or something after the game but nah nothing really, maybe have a victory drink or something. The bragging from winning a trophy comes years after the final match, I'll enjoy that I guess!</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Yep you definitely do get bragging rights for winning that's for sure. Ok, well its time to start wrapping up. So do you have any final thoughts for your adoring fans?</p></div>

<div class="speaker atti"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_atti.png" alt="atti" /><p>Yes, I'd like to thank all three of them for their support, particularly users Aeroblacktyl and ChomperTheSharptooth, it is time to achieve.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Cool. Well, it's been a pleasure. Thanks for your time and best of luck in the rest of the tournament!</p></div>

<div class="speaker atti"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_atti.png" alt="atti" /><p>Thank you. Looking forward to seeing what sogeking has to say.</p></div>

<div class="speaker ty"><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_ty.png" alt="ty" /><p>Haha you'll know soon enough.</p></div>

<div class="aside"><p>As soon as the interview was finished, we put our full attention on the battle. Unfortunately, we missed most of the action, which was pretty disappointing, but at least we could watch the replay. So, I shook Atticus's hand and made my leave. As I made my way to my hotel room, I recollected all of the things I learned from the semifinalists. They were all genuinely good people and I would be happy with whoever wins.</p></div>
