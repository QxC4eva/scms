<h3>New RU Moderator</h3>
<h4>Posted by DittoCrow on <strong>Mar 26, 2013</strong></h4>

<p>Congratulations to <a href="/forums/members/molk.99727/">Molk</a> for becoming the newest moderator of RarelyUsed! Molk has stuck with RU for a very long time and has been making some great contributions recently to keep the forum active, such as running the Viability Ranking Thread. I'm sure that the RU forum will be running very smoothly in the future. Once again, congrats! This promotion is very well-deserved.</p>
