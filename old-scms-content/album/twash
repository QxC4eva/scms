<p>Went to Italy with friends this week. Managed to cram a lot in four or so days.. in Venice (omg pretty) we pretty much explored the city, couple of islands, Doge's Palace and Basilica. In Rome (two of the four days) we managed to cover the Colosseum, Spanish Steps, Roman Forum, Pantheon, Altare della Patria, and managed to do the Vatican Museums (inc. Sistine Chapel) and the Basilica. Was all pretty incredible haha. Anyway, have some pics from Venice. Cba to sort through the others atm, way too many.</p>
