<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When this Pokemon is hit by a super effective Ghost-type move, the damage is reduced by 50%. This item is consumed after use. If this item is recovered via Recycle, it can activate again. Provides a one-time 60 power Ghost attack when a Pokemon holding this item uses Natural Gift.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This type-resist Berry (one that reduces damage taken from Ghost-type attacks) is one of the lesser used type-resist Berries, and for good reason. Not many Pokemon need to take reduced damage from super effective Ghost-type attacks, as the only real user of Ghost moves in OU is Gengar, while in UU, Mismagius is the only real abuser. The Rotom formes may also use Shadow Ball, but nothing in particular needs to resist this, although it could be useful on Pokemon such as Alakazam and the like.</p>
