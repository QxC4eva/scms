<h2>Description</h2>
<p>User is made invulnerable for one turn, then hits the next turn.The user cannot make a move between turns. The user can still be hit by Swift on the invulnerable turn. If the user is fully paralyzed or hits itself in confusion when trying to execute the second turn of this move, it will remain invulnerable until it uses Fly again, but it will be free to choose other moves. This move also has an in-game effect that allows the player to fly to any town or facility with a Pokemon Center they have previously visited.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>One of those moves that sounds great in theory but more or less collapses in practice, especially competitively. It's basically Protect for the first round, and then an attack on the second. The main downfall of the move is the protecting part, since if you try to use it against something weak to it, nothing stops your opponent for simply switching out to a counter safely. The lower accuracy can also present a problem.</p>
