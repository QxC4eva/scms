<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Special Attack by two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Nasty Plot is one of the best setup moves for a special attacking sweeper. Despite not being a TM, it still has reasonable distribution, and so is a commonly seen move in most competitive matches, with good users everywhere, from Ubers to NU. In Ubers, Darkrai is the most commonly seen thanks to its incredibly high Special Attack, Speed, typing, and movepool, not to mention its access to Dark Void. In OU, Thundurus-T is a notable user thanks to its colossal Special Attack, good typing, decent Speed, and movepool. Nasty Plot Lucario is also viable, largely due to the surprise factor that comes with it, as Swords Dance Lucario is far more common. The lower tiers have many users of Nasty Plot, including Azelf, Mismagius, Togekiss, and Houndoom for UU; Slowking and Jynx for RU; and Raichu, Beheeyem, and Simipour in NU. It's a move that most special attackers would die for.</p>
