<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Multitype is hardcoded to only work for <a href="/bw/pokemon/arceus">Arceus</a>. The wielder changes its type on switching in depending on the Plate heldâ€”each Plate corresponds to a different type. The wielder is immune to all item removal effects, so long as it is holding a Plate: <a href="/bw/moves/covet">Covet</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/knock_off">Knock Off</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/switcheroo">Switcheroo</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/thief">Thief</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/trick">Trick</a>. If the wielder is not currently holding a Plate, it cannot be given one by means of <a href="/bw/moves/bestow">Bestow</a>, Switcheroo, or Trick. This ability can't be copied, replaced, or changed by <a href="/bw/abilities/mummy">Mummy</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a>, <a href="/bw/abilities/trace">Trace</a>, or similar effects. It cannot be suppressed by <a href="/bw/moves/gastro_acid">Gastro Acid</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/worry_seed">Worry Seed<a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This ability is insane, as it literally makes a Pokemon uncounterable. It makes it even worse that the only user is the Pokemon with the highest Base Stat Total in the game: Arceus. There are hundreds of possibilities opened up thanks to Multitype, so it needs no mention really that it is one of the best abilities in the game.</p>
