<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder is unaffected by certain non-damaging moves that target it and instead will redirect such moves to the original user. The accuracy check occurs after the move is redirected. Moves can only be redirected once; if both Pokemon have Magic Bounce, only the ability of the target triggers. Similarly, if the wielder uses a move that will be redirected on a Pokemon using <a href="/bw/moves/magic_coat">Magic Coat</a>, the move will be redirected back to the wielder and Magic Bounce will not take effect. <a href="/bw/moves/spikes">Spikes</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/stealth_rock">Stealth Rock</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/toxic_spikes">Toxic Spikes</a> can only be reflected once per side, by the leftmost Pokemon under this effect. If a move that would be redirected by Magic Bounce has multiple targets (such as <a href="/bw/moves/tail_whip">Tail Whip</a>), it will successfully activate on Pokemon in order from left to right until it targets the wielder, at which point the attack is redirected and it will not target other Pokemon. When such moves are redirected, the wielder will target each Pokemon that it is able to. The abilities <a href="/bw/abilities/lightningrod">Lightningrod</a> and <a href="/bw/abilities/storm_drain">Storm Drain</a> redirect their respective moves before this ability takes effect.</p>

<p>The following moves are redirected by Magic Bounce:</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This ability alone is what has propelled <a href="/bw/pokemon/espeon">Espeon</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/xatu">Xatu</a> to a higher level of usageâ€”being able to switch in and not only prevent status conditions and field effects, but to put them onto your opponent is immense. It allows your team to not have to carry a Stealth Rock user, as you can simply bounce your opponent's. It also provides many sweepers with a buffer against burn and paralysis. Similarly, it aids Espeon and Xatu in Baton Passing greatly, forming an intermediate stage of safety before your cleaner switches in.</p>
