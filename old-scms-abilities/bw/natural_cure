Cures status on switching out.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heals all status ailments upon switching out. If the ability is copied by <a href="/bw/abilities/Trace">Trace</a>, the status condition will be removed before the ability is, therefore curing the Pokemon. In-game, this ability heals status at the end of the battle.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>A great defensive ability, primarily seen on <a href="/bw/pokemon/chansey">Chansey</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/blissey">Blissey</a>, the perennial special walls. <a href="/bw/pokemon/starmie">Starmie</a> also loves it so it can use <a href="/bw/moves/rapid_spin">Rapid Spin</a> to remove entry hazards, while being able to remove paralysis and poison from <a href="/bw/moves/toxic_spikes">Toxic Spikes</a>. Other Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/moves/roserade">Roserade</a> like it too so it can use it in combination with <a href="/bw/moves/rest">Rest</a>, to fully heal itself without much to worry about except switching out safely. The ability to not be totally destroyed by <a href="/bw/moves/toxic">Toxic</a> is very underrated for defensive Pokemon and makes stall that much harder to beat.</p>
