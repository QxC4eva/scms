<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Generation 6 has brought us a slew of new "formes" via Mega Evolution, which transforms our favorite old Pokémon into a bunch of new, different monsters! In this Judge a Pokémon, however, we are not judging the competitive values of these Mega Evolutions. Instead, we will be taking a look at the aesthetics of the Pokémon that received a Mega Evolution, both before and after, to see what worked and what didn't. I, the one true god RODAN, along with Crux, skylight, and Bummer, will be depicted as Snorlax, Aromatisse, Emboar, and Quagsire, respectively, as we throw down the gavel of JUDGEMENT upon four hand-picked Pokémon.</p>

<div class="panel">

<h3>Gengar</h3>
<div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/jap_gengar.png" alt="Gengar"/></div>

<div class="panel-speaker rodan"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_rodan.png" alt="RODAN" /><p>I have always liked Gengar; any Pokémon that quite clearly doesn't take itself seriously will always get at least a pass. The thing that separates Gengar from the rest of the pack is just how simple and crisp it is. It looks like something a three-year-old would draw, or something out of Pixar's <em>Monsters University</em> (out on DVD now!). Everything about it screams "bogeyman," without being overplayed. It has a simple creepiness to it that also exudes charisma and personality. Also, it has been OU since RBY. How cool is that!?</p>

<p>Mega Gengar, on the other hand, is not nearly as flawless as its vanilla counterpart. There is something about it&mdash;maybe it is its shit-eating grin, maybe it's Shadow Tag, maybe it's Maybelline but I just cannot take this dude seriously. It is probably why I am so terrible at OU, because every time I look at it I think to myself, "there's no way this guy will do anything!" and then I cry. Repeat this cycle <em>ad nauseam</em>. Personally, I think the strangest part of its shiny new suit is the arms, because they don't look like they could be used for anything. I assume it's because it is like a turret of sorts? But I honestly have no idea.</p>

<p>Normal Gengar is like nine hundred times better though so I don't care what Mega Gengar thinks about me.</p></div>

<div class="panel-speaker crux"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_crux.png" alt="Crux" /><p>The only thing that I really have against Gengar's base design is that it's as portly as Ghosts get. The only place that Gengar would haunt is a fast food restaurant. Despite that, Gengar exudes charm. The grin and the tiny little arms and legs make it adorable, and it's purple so that's a plus too!</p>

<p>I actually really like Mega Gengar. Not because it's well-designed or anything, but because it looks an awful lot like a Chihuahua that died of rabies. The addition of a pointlessly larger tail, the forward-leaning quadrupedal (assuming there are additional feet in there somewhere) pose and the blood-crazed eyes all work towards creating this image. As such, whenever I face a Mega Gengar, I can't help but laugh when this little mutt traps whatever I have out and proceeds to hump it to death with its Shadow Balls.</p></div>

<div class="panel-speaker skylight"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_skylight.png" alt="skylight" /><p>Gengar has one of the best designs in Pokémon. I can't quite put my finger on it, but a gigantic fat purple ball of gas looks kind of cool! When I imagine it, I kind of just think of a giant creature running at me to both scare and prank me. To top it off, it's purple! What screams "fun" more than purple? Well, blue might but Gengar is purple so for this time we're just going to say purple is what makes Gengar's design so wonderful.</p>

<p>Mega Gengar, on the other hand, has a nicer shade of purple, but it looks like it was ripped straight out of a cartoon. Gengar always looked cartoonish but Mega Gengar takes this to a brand new level. Its eyes are given extra depth, and its mouth is enhanced, which gives it a more classic cartoonish feel compared to the original Gengar, which looked funny but didn't really have additional depth to it. Despite having a kiddy feel, Mega Gengar doesn't really... have much else going for it. Its tail serves very little purpose at all, and only really seems to exist to balance out its design. It could live without the tail, and moreover it just makes Mega Gengar look more squashed than Gengar. Like, I kind of think that Game Freak one day sat down and said, "Oh, Gengar looks too fat, let's squash it up a bit and see if that improves the design." Fun fact: it didn't help. At least it has a cool face, that's all that matters, right?</p></div>

<div class="panel-speaker bummer"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_bummer.png" alt="Bummer" /><p>While Gengar remains as one of the most popular Ghosts from the early days, I may be one of the few who believes the evolution line should have capped at Haunter. Going from a rugged shadow with spectral claws into a round poltergeist with chubby limbs is, for me, an anti-climax, although its jeering smile serves as its saving grace. But compared to other Ghost-types, Gengar is surprisingly simple for a final evolution, and while one may argue that the first generation had a large number of simple designs, Gengar's rotund build and cheesy grin makes it easy to remember and connect with, which might be why this purple blob has managed to amass so many people into its haunted fanclub.</p>

<p>With that said, little of that is preserved within its Mega Evolution. Much like the Dragonball universe, Game Freak have decided to measure its power by the size of its hair, and then spread said growth to its arms and tail alike, thus allowing it to disguise itself as tall grass wherever it wants. Its eyes and smile were also emphasized further, as they're now duplicating the look of an ecstatic serial killer or a vengeful clown, where either option is enough to make the opponent more than just uncomfortable. And to top it all off, we have yet another eye which never stops blinking, never stops judging, and refuses to acknowledge the color scheme its eyes had to begin with. So instead of improving upon Gengar's design, it appears that they instead chose to amplify everything about it, thus creating a monster which not only looks distressed but also off-the-charts insane.</p></div>

<h3>Tyranitar</h3>
<div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/jap_tyranitar.png" alt="Tyranitar"/></div>

<div class="panel-speaker rodan"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_rodan.png" alt="RODAN" /><p>If you couldn't tell from my name, I have always been a big Godzilla fan, which is why Tyranitar has a special place in my heart. I mean, it's a little portly, and the color scheme is a little murky, but if you wanted to capture the feel of a monster that could threaten Tokyo, this is definitely the way to do it. Tyranitar is a menacing terror-beast and encapsulates everything that I think Pokémon should be.</p>

<p>Mega Tyranitar is the SpaceGodzilla of Pokémon. An unnecessary upgrade that adds random shoulder spikes but is still really cool. <em>Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla</em> was released in 1994 with the sole purpose of trying to update Godzilla for a more hip and modern crowd. This is exactly the same purpose of Mega Tyranitar, and if this is the trend that all companies have to follow, then so be it. But I will look at it with disdain regardless.</p></div>

<div class="panel-speaker crux"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_crux.png" alt="Crux" /><p>Tyranitar is an ugly Pokémon. It has always been a touch too fat, its arms have always been a touch too short; it could never be the monster that Game Freak desired. And in Generation VI, the sprite icon got even fatter. Perhaps they thought that we would find a chubby little monster to be endearing&mdash;Game Freak should have learned from RODAN's parents' mistake if that was the case. Despite the shortcomings of its aesthetic design, Tyranitar's competitive design is excellent, and it has dominated the competitive scene since its release in GSC.</p>

<p>I feel like Mega Tyranitar should be to Japan what Uncle Sam is to the United States. Uncle Sam is iconic because he embodies the primary exports of the United States: courage, patriotism, and the military. While Japan's three most important exports are a far more eclectic group, Mega Tyranitar somehow manages to embody all three: Pokémon, Godzilla, and Tentacle Porn. With Tyranitar's greatest asset, Sand Stream, having been nerfed this generation, Tyranitar probably needed some new toys, but I feel like the weather nerf alone may finally knock the tyrant from his throne.</p></div>

<div class="panel-speaker skylight"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_skylight.png" alt="skylight" /><p>Tyranitar has a great design. It's not exactly terrifying, but what makes it mega awesome is that it looks badass. It doesn't have to look scary as long as it looks badass, and my GOD does it look badass or what? You've got black randomly thrown around on parts of it, a cool green shell, and its face says "I ain't gonna take any shit from you." Literally, Tyranitar is the definition of badass in Pokémon.</p>

<p>Mega Tyranitar, on the other hand, should not have been able to exist. It looks like an overgrown tree with armor. There are way too many features on it. It's trying to look scary, but it fails at looking scary and just looks stupid. Its longer tail does nothing for it and would be a bitch to have hanging around you. As for its head, it's too long. It doesn't need an antenna, it's a dinosaur. In those days there was no TV. It can live without TV&mdash;get rid of the antenna, and get rid of the terrible design while you're at it Tyranitar!</p></div>

<div class="panel-speaker bummer"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_bummer.png" alt="Bummer" /><p>Throughout all Pokémon versions, Tyranitar appears to be the only dinosaur-like Pokémon that was too persistent to go extinct, where its sluggish exterior has always been backed up by a stern demeanor and brute force. It is, however, somewhat counter-productive to have glaring holes in its armor, not to mention that the exposed blue abs and its peeled banana tail make for some peculiar details as well. Nonetheless, the fact remains that it's the Pokémon world's equivalent to Godzilla, thus rendering any criticism null and void.</p>

<p>When you look upon Mega Tyranitar, the first thing you'll notice is its large protruding spikes. The second thing you'll notice is that beneath all those jagged shapes lies something that looks like a Tyranitar. Since its chest has been granted some glaring eyes of its own, you get the impression that its centerpiece is now under the influence of a malicious spirit, which would explain why its spikes have grown out of control. Besides its haunted vest, Mega Tyranitar sets itself apart further from its lesser self by sporting a wicked mohawk along with two hazardous knee-caps, completing the look of a rebellious teenager who desperately yearns for the world's attention. I do acknowledge the direction they took with their design, but Game Freak ultimately overdid it when it came to its rocky spires. At least every move is a STAB move now.</p></div>

<h3>Absol</h3>
<div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/jap_absol.png" alt="Absol"/></div>

<div class="panel-speaker rodan"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_rodan.png" alt="RODAN" /><p>I hate Absol. I hate its stupid white fur, I hate its fur tufts, I hate that stupid spike thing on its head. Everything about its design screams "EDGY!" Absol is the type of Pokémon that listens to Disturbed and Linkin Park because they're the only musics that appeal to its moral ambiguity. Seriously, Absol seems like something out of the darkest and most grimiest recesses of <em>deviantart.com</em> and I do not support it. There are also some practical issues like "how does it sleep without impaling itself?" or "what benefits could a tail like that possibly have?"</p>

<p>Mega Absol just takes everything I hate about Absol and amplifies it. Its design looks like something produced by Square Enix; its so ridiculous that I don't think I can hate it as much as I hate Absol. Absol is just the normal, angsty sort of bad, whereas Mega Absol is so over the top that I cant help but giggle at it every single time.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><h3>"MY MEGA STONE IS THE STONE THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS!"</h3></div></div>

<div class="panel-speaker crux"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_crux.png" alt="Crux" /><p>Absol is a super edgy Pokémon that appeals to the 14 year olds who play Pokémon and wish they were as cool as their non-Pokémon playing counterparts. As a result, Absol is what I imagine user: joshe would be if he were a Pokémon&mdash;tries too hard to be edgy, every action is a disaster, and only appeals to girls under the age of 12. That being said, I quite like Absol because I think it's hilarious.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mega Absol loses this appeal because it becomes really damn gay. Only in a country where JPOP and KPOP are normalized can something this terrible be appreciated. Mega Absol looks like some weird cross between BIGBANG's Daesung and every bad Sephiroth cosplayer ever. Mega Absol is terrible and makes me ashamed to like cock as much as it clearly does.</p></div>

<div class="panel-speaker skylight"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_skylight.png" alt="skylight" /><p>Even though Absol is meant to represent disaster and misfortune, it's pretty hard to take its design seriously. The fur beard shares a likeness to Rafiki from The Lion King and the color of its face is also similar to Rafiki's. Due to this, I always kind of imagined Absol taking a Pokémon's life, then rushing off to rub honey on a baby Litleo's forehead. The rest of its body doesn't really seem terrifying, either. If anything it seems pretty tame, even compared to some Normal-types!</p>

<p>Mega Absol, on the other hand, is what a real devourer of souls should look like. The masked face implies it has something to hide and that it is serious. It also has a dominating stance which makes it look confident and assured compared to Absol's previous design. The wings add a good touch, as traditionally wings represent angels, so Absol is now seen as a kind of dark angel, something to be cautious of, which is a huge improvement on Absol's previous design.</p></div>

<div class="panel-speaker bummer"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_bummer.png" alt="Bummer" /><p>Absol may appear to be one of those Pokémon that was designed with little thought put behind it. Take a dog, add scythes to it, and then call it a day as you move on to a new subject. But since Pokémon have plenty of roots in Eastern culture, Absol's origins can be traced to one such legend, which unfortunately leaves the western populations unaware of its meaning. With that said, Absol is a surprisingly simple Pokémon despite its Gen III debut, where its sleek body and thorny paws makes for an elegant appearance, albeit somewhat forgettable.</p>

<p>And on the topic of simple designs, Mega Absol is not one. While I have no inside info regarding its new exterior, I can only conclude that the people tasked with the assignment had little to work with. That, or they accidentally designed a new character for Kingdom Hearts. With its scythe now reduced to a short blade, the rest of Mega Absol's appearance can essentially be attributed to additional hair tufts, where its 'wings' grab the most attention while giving it a more divine look in the process. On one hand, I find this change to be suitable for Absol, while on the other hand, this sudden grooming could just as well be given to a good number of other Pokémon with the same results (see: Ampharos).</p></div>

<h3>Blaziken</h3>
<div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/jap_blaziken.png" alt="Blaziken"/></div>

<div class="panel-speaker rodan"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_rodan.png" alt="RODAN" /><p>Ah! The <em>Blazin Kickin Chicken</em>&trade;. As much as I hate describing something like this, it really, really looks like a Digimon&mdash;as if your trainer, after finding the Crest of Courage, forced Combusken to undergo ULTIMATE TRANSFORMATION. If this happened, you would probably end up with Blaziken. There are a few quirks with Blaziken that I don't really like, namely its stupid hair tuft (see a pattern?); it really covers up what could otherwise quite possibly be a cool anthropomorphic bird-beast. Also, it should really stop walking on its feathers, as they are getting all ragged.</p>

<p>So, I just noticed that Mega Blaziken's tufts are shaped like an "X" now, and I really can't focus on the rest of it. I mean, OK, I get it, this is Pokémon X, but man, way to shoehorn it in. The Mega Evolution somehow makes it even clunkier and less cool than it was before. Can you imagine the sheer amount of hair gel it must use in order to keep that X shapely? It would put Limitless to shame.</p></div>

<div class="panel-speaker crux"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_crux.png" alt="Crux" /><p>Blaziken is clearly the worst Hoenn starter, and that is saying a lot. Did Game Freak seriously think that they could make the idea of a "karate chicken" successful? I think the worst part of this design is definitely Blaziken's head and the weird furry things that protrude from it like wings. Blaziken looks like something taken straight out of Tekken and placed into the Pokémon world and it looks very out of place.</p>

<p>Mega Blaziken continues this trend but is even edgier. This Pokémon seriously looks like something that would only appeal to pathetic kids who idolize Naruto and Luffy in order to cope with their pathetic lives. You know what, maybe I'm being too harsh. Perhaps Mega Blaziken and the other edgy Mega Evolutions demonstrate a broader shift in Japanese culture, particularly among the younger generations. Mega Evolution could just be Game Freak's attempt at sociopolitical commentary. I think that Mega Blaziken embodies the increase in rebelliousness and the importance of an individual (edgy) identity for Japanese youth as a reaction to the harsh nationalism of Shinzo Abe's government. Perhaps Mega Blaziken also symbolizes a greater focus on women's issues in Japan, with the obscene protrusion between regular Blaziken's legs being replaced with a gender neutral, unisex pair of pants for the Mega Evolution. Or maybe it's just shit.</p></div>

<div class="panel-speaker skylight"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_skylight.png" alt="skylight" /><p>Blaziken has a very awkward design. Torchic and Combusken have great designs, and are both quite feminine compared to Blaziken in that they don't come off as aggressive and are designed to look rather petite, but when they evolve they turn into this manly fighting chicken. The idea is cool, but the way it was executed isn't really as cool. Blaziken's "hair" is quite interesting for a number of reasons. For one, chickens don't have hair, secondly, why is its hair sitting that way? And thirdly, it needs a better stylist. Blaziken's pants, on the other hand, were so cool that Erza from Fairy Tail had to copy it (it was awkward when she rocked it better than Blaziken did, though!).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mega Blaziken has lost the cool pants and instead it looks like a fighter now. The fire coming from its arms shows that it has burning ambition, and its hair was redesigned to look like a cross at parts (perhaps representing the Fighting-type move, Cross Chop?). Its eyes and mouth also give off the picture that it means business and should be taken seriously. While its design isn't perfect, at least Mega Blaziken shows what Blaziken is meant to be: a fighting chicken (with really cool pants).</p></div>

<div class="panel-speaker bummer"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue31/judge_a_bummer.png" alt="Bummer" /><p>While Charizard has swayed the hearts of many young trainers as the Fire starter of choice, Blaziken is arguably one of its first successors that managed to reach the same bar, or perhaps even raise it. They set out to combine eagles, kickboxing, fire, and mullets, and thankfully they succeeded, because Blaziken is now entering its fourth generation and is still rocking the look, even with two other firefighters competing for a teamslot. Its lack of visible feet may be my only quibble with its design, but it's one I can easily gloss over given that its other features flow together to create one stunning cockfighter.</p>

<p>Granted, with so little to improve upon, Blaziken's Mega Evolution is virtually the same, apart from its mullet sacrificing some of its girth to improve upon the vest below. Most Fire starters also have a live flame incorporated somewhere in their design to fully emphasize how they are, indeed, a Fire-type, and not just creatures with flamboyant color schemes. For the longest time, Blaziken has been a noteworthy exception in this regard, but with its new Mega forme, its flaming scarves will surely clear any doubts about its typing. And if that wasn't enough, its new feather mail with matching flame decals should hopefully eradicate any leftover suspicions. Quite frankly, I'm surprised they didn't set its hair on fire too.</p></div>
