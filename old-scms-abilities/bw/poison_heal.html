[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is poisoned (regardless of whether it is regular or badly poisoned), it heals 1/8th of its maximum HP at the end of each turn, and is immune to poison damage. If the wielder is under the effect of <a href="/bw/moves/heal_block">Heal Block</a>, it does not gain HP at the end of the turn. If the wielder loses Poison Heal, the Toxic damage it receives at the end of the turn is the same as it would be getting on that turn if it hadn't had Poison Heal.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Both <a href="/bw/pokemon/breloom">Breloom</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/gliscor">Gliscor</a> are great and extremely annoying Pokemon due to this ability. Gliscor especially is a staple of this generation it seems, and adores the 12.5% health boost at the end of every turn, allowing it to counter the metagame's biggest threats, such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/excadrill">Excadrill</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/terrakion">Terrakion</a>. Breloom is altogether different, usually using <a href="/bw/moves/spore">Spore</a> and <a href="/bw/moves/focus_punch">Focus Punch</a>, but it really is all due to the health boost granted by Poison Heal. The ability is so good, both use <a href="/bw/items/toxic_orb">Toxic Orb</a> commonly as their held item to make sure they get the boost as quickly as possible with little risk.</p>
