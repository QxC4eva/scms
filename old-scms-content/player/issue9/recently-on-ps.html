<h4>Recent Bug Fixes</h4>
<p class="publication-info">By <a href="/forums/members/antemortem.192841/">antemortem</a> on February 21, 2015</p>
<p>Some bugs have been fixed: Using Conversion 2 on Porygon2 no longer runs down the battle timer, Natural Gift's type now correctly becomes Electric instead of Ice when used with Belue Berry, and several other Random Battle mechanics, along with some in-battle mechanics that didn't accurately reflect the games, have also been fixed. Thanks a ton to our development and research staff that are constantly at work improving PS!</p></td>
