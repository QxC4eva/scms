Moves
========

Agility is to get Mantyke's speed to a comfortable 28.
Hydro Pump is powerful stab, since mantyke needs as much power as it can muster.
Air Slash goes along quite nicely with Hydro Pump, as not a lot of pokemon in LC resist Water/Flying together.
Ice beam is for scoring super effective hits on Cradily, Tyrunt, a safe option against gligar if you don't want to use Hydro Pump, and other flying types.
Substitute is slashed in to prevent status, as thunder wave will ruin mantyke's day, as well as ease it from taking hits from priority.

EVS / ITEM / NATURE INFORMATION GOES HERE
EVs are chosen to maximise speed while putting a great deal in power; a few are lifted out, however, and put into its defense to help it against hits. If Life orb is chosen however, the HP IV should be set to 0, and the remaining EVs placed into defense to bulk it up further; this gives Mantyke 19 HP and thus only takes 1 hp damage from Life Orb recoil. Eviolite loses out on power, but allows it to set up much, much easier. Berry juice is similar; it can take repeated hits and go back to full health without skipping a beat, so long as it's not ohko'd and continue sweeping.
