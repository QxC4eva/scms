<h3>ABOUT ROCKET GRUNT</h3>

<p>Rocket Grunt was mostly active in Smeargle's Studio from April 2009 to August 2010. During this time he was not attending school, but worked a few shitty jobs and was involved in some small acting and voice-over projects. Eventually he got his stuff straight and re-enrolled. He doesn't post drawings on the internet as often, but still wastes a lot of time playing Minecraft and other games on Steam when he's not doing homework. You might have seen some of his drawings on *chan websites or Reddit.</p>

<p>The first bunch of his images posted on Smogon were done on an oekaki board with a mouse. Later he got his hands on a Wacom tablet and also started scanning pencil sketches. Sometimes he combines scanned drawings with color through Adobe Photoshop. Most of them feature a warm muted palette, but show a loose grasp of depth and weight. He tends to be heavy-handed in textures and is rarely meticulous enough to include a background. He has an immature sense of humor, likes exaggerated facial expressions, and his line drawings are whippy and gestural.</p>

<h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>

<p>Rocket Grunt has contributed images for Smogon's webzine <em>The Smog</em> since its beginning in May 2009. He received his badge that following July. He attends a notable art and design school in New York City. His sign is Gemini and he enjoys long walks on the beach and strawberry ice cream.</p>
