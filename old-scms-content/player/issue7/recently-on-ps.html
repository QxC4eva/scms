<h4>Server Owners: Urgent Update</h4>
<p class="publication-info">By <a href="/forums/members/jasmine.141145/">Jasmine</a> on January 6, 2015</p>
<p>Pok&eacute;mon Showdown is altering its server registration system. Every server must now have a contact email and Smogon account that will serve as Pok&eacute;mon Showdown's main method of contacting your server over any pressing concerns. Think carefully before you decide on the email address and Smogon account to be linked to your server as the owner of both will be considered the server's sole owner in the event of any disputes that require our intervention.</p>
<p>Server Registration will remain closed for a month, or until all our current servers have updated to the new system. If any servers have failed to contact us by the end of this we will be forced to deregister them. For more information on this change and on how to contact us please check <a href="/forums/threads/register-servers-update-required.3526386/'><strong>this thread</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Please remember that if you do not own a server, this does not concern you. If you co-own a server or have other relevant inquiries for PS! administration, you should do so by <a href="/forums/conversations/add?to=Haunter,%20Jasmine,%20Verbatim'><strong>clicking here to private message Haunter, verbatim, and Jasmine</strong></a>. </td>

<h4>Gen 1: Random Battle</h4>
<p class="publication-info">By <a href="/forums/members/dell.135483/">Dell</a> on January 9, 2015</p>
<p>As we're sure you're all having fun with our ORAS iteration of Random Battle, we're now glad to announce the creation of <strong>our first gen version of Random Battle</strong>! Similarly to ORAS Random Battle, the Gen 1's iteration gives each player 6 random Pok&eacute;mon with varying levels and combination of moves that aims to make the Pok&eacute;mon as competitively viable as possible. Enjoy a new version of what's been a really successful and enjoyable format!</p>
<p>If some of you haven't noticed, the Gen 1 Randbats background features a layout created by the lovely and talented Sprite Leader <a href="/forums/members/layell.6237/">Layell</a>. The layout is reminiscent of the old Red/Blue/Yellow in-battle game screen, so it ties in perfectly with the server-exclusive format. We hope you all enjoy this new format and ladder your way to victory with no natures and lack of disambiguation between Special Attack and Special Defense!</p></td>
