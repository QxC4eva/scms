Overview
########
- The Knock Off buff was huge for Pawniard, giving it a drawback-free 97.5 BP move if the foe has an item
- Pawniard is now pretty much impossible to switch into because of its damage and the threat of losing a valuable item
- Furthermore, the proliferation of Berry Juice means that Knock Off is most of the time not diminished by Eviolite defensive boosts
- Swords Dance, powerful priority, and its Fairy-busting Steel STAB add onto an already awesome Pokemon
- Still has that 4x Fighting weakness, as well as a weakness to Ground
- The presence of Sun means boosted Fire attacks
- An incredibly solid Pokemon in the current metagame


Eviolite
#######
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance / Pursuit
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Iron Head
ability: Defiant
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice / Life Orb
evs: 76 HP / 76 Atk / 36 Def / 116 SpD / 196 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

- Swords Dance lets Pawniard break walls early-game and sweep late-game.
- Sucker Punch gives Pawniard a way to beat faster threats after a Swords Dance, but only if they attack you.
- Knock Off hits really hard with the 50% damage boost from the target having an item and STAB
- Iron Head is for Fairies and a secondary STAB move for when Sucker Punch or Knock Off aren't a good choice

Set Details
========

- Attack stat is high enough that the extra points gained by maxing are too important
- Max Speed + Jolly lets it always outspeed Swirlix before Unburden, among other things
- Remaining EVs increase its defenses to reach Eviolite numbers
- Berry Juice can be used over Evioite to provide a better sweep, but sacrifices its ability to take hits such as LO Murkrow's Heat Wave
- Life Orb provides huge power after a Swords Dance, but makes Pawniard extremely frail

Usage Tips
========

- Pawniard's Knock Off is incredibly hard to switch into, so use it freely when it is safe
- Swirlix requires a Swords Dance boost to OHKO, so set one up before trying to KO it so you aren't 2HKOed by Flamethrower
- If the opponent tries to switch Sticky Hold users against Pawniard, take advantage of the fact that Knock Off's 50% damage boost always applies against them
- Knock Off also removes Berry Juice before its effect kicks in
- Defiant gives Pawniard an edge against Sticky Web teams, Intimidate users, and Defoggers

Team Options
========

- Sweepers such as Swirlix and Murkrow love Pawniard's Knock Off support
- The above are also capable of destroying Fighting-types, who plague Pawniard with 4x super effective Fighting attacks
- Meditite likes Pawniard's ability to KO Fairies, Ghosts, and Psychics so it can spam HJK
- Something capable of taking care of Gligar is a good idea

Choice Scarf
#######
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Brick Break
move 4: Pursuit / Sucker Punch
ability: Defiant
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SDef / 196 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

- Knock Off hits really hard with the 50% damage boost from the target having an item and STAB, works well with Scarf
- Iron Head hits Fairy-types and Rock-types harder than Knock Off
- Brick Break is specifically for opposing Pawniard, but does its job well
- Pursuit traps weakened stuff that could normally switch out
- Sucker Punch gives priority, but is somewhat redundant with Pawniard's Speed

Set Details
========

- Attack and Speed are fully invested to increase damage output
- Remaining EVs increase its defenses by one point each.
- Adamant is not an option even with the increased Speed from Scarf

Usage Tips
========

- Scarf Knock Off is very dangerous, so use that wherever possible
- Be careful of locking yourself into Pursuit or Sucker Punch
- This set checks opposing Pawniard very well due to the surprise factor
- Also gets around some of Pawniard's usual checks such as Misdreavus

Team Options
========

- Fairly self-sufficient, needs very little support
- Sweepers such as Swirlix and Murkrow love Pawniard's Knock Off support
- The above are also capable of destroying Fighting-types, who plague Pawniard with 4x super effective Fighting attacks
- Meditite likes Pawniard's ability to KO Fairies, Ghosts, and Psychics so it can spam HJK
- Sun teams enjoy its ability to get rid of Snover
- Also good on teams that hate facing Pawniard

Other Options
########

- If you really need a setter, Pawniard can learn Stealth Rock (its not illegal with Sucker Punch anymore)
- It can use that with a more support-oriented set to reliably set them up while giving Knock Off support
- More fun stuff: Pursuit, Psycho Cut, Rock Polish, Thunder Wave, maybe even Magnet Rise

Checks & Counters
########

- Fighting-types and Fighting moves
- Gligar has a super-effective Earthquake, massive Defense, and a higher Speed
- Sun sweepers can roast it with Fire moves, but many of them (ex. Bellsprout) are frail enough to KO or heavily damage them with Sucker Punch
- Spikes are a problem because it's grounded with no recovery
