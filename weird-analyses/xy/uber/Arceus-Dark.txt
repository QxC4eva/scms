Overview
########
- Checks Mega Mewtwo-Y, which is an otherwise good stallbreaker.
- Checks Arceus-Ghost, which is another big threat.
- Access to good utility moves.
- Good typing offensively thanks to the Steel-type nerf.
- Weakness to Fairy hurts it a lot.
- Faces competition from other Arceus formes in every role.
- Not resistant to a lot of types, which hurts its role as a supporter.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Judgment
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Refresh / Sludge Bomb
move 4: Recover
item: Dread Plate
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 160 SpD / 96 Spe

Moves
========
- Judgment for STAB damage which has pretty good coverage all alone thanks to the Steel-type nerf.
- Calm Mind is self explanatory. Setup vs special attackers, and sometimes even vs physical attackers, and attempt to sweep.
- Refresh makes it a good stallbreaker and makes sure status dosen't stop it from sweeping. It also acts as status absorber. It can help win Calm Mind wars vs other Arceus formes that rely on Toxic as well.
- Sludge Bomb gives coverage vs Fairy-types and can catch them by surprise, and can help win Calm Mind wars thanks to the poison chance.
- Recover is used for longevity, which helps a bulky Pokemon like this a lot and makes sweeps more effective, as well as dealing with stall teams.

Set Details
========
- Max HP to tank as hard as possible.
- 96+ Speed EVs to outspeed 100 base Speed Pokemon.
- Rest dumped in Special Defense to make sure it can tank special attackers better.

Usage tips
========
- Arceus's main niche is to switch into Palkia, which has a very good coverage and can hit almost everything in the tier for super effective damage. Switch it into special attackers and then alternate between Calm Mind and Recover.
- It can switch into Mega Mewtwo-Y since even Aura Sphere fails to 2HKO. In return, you can either use Judgment, or setup Calm Mind and then Recover, and then go for the kill, although watch out for Focus Blast, which is unreliable, but can 2HKO Dark-Arceus.
- It's better for scout for the Mewtwo forme if it's unknown since Mega Mewtwo-X can deal a lot of damage, so when a normal Mewtwo switches into Dark-Arceus, scout it with your Fighting resisting Pokemon that can take special hits well.
- Arceus-Dark appreciates Stealth Rock and Spikes removal since it other can get 2HKOed at times before it can Recover, although it's not that crucial to remove hazards from the field for it.
- It's good to switch it into any status-using stall Pokemon, since it can easily deal with them thanks to Refresh, so Arceus-Dark functions well as a stallbreaker.

Team Options
========
- Lugia is a good teammate, being able to handle stuff like Mega Mewtwo-X and Blaziken, which threaten Arceus-Dark.
- Steel-types like Aegislash and Scizor help with Arceus-Dark's fairy weakness.

Other Options
========
- A support moveset can be used with moves like Perish Song, Defog, Toxic, Thunder Wave, Stealth Rock, Magic Coat, Roar and Will-O-Wisp.
- Stone Edge can be used as a surprise factor for Ho-Oh, which can easily tank Arceus-Dark otherwise.
- Substitute can be used over Refresh on the Calm Mind moveset, but Toxic Spikes then become a problem.

Checks & Counters
########
- Ho-Oh easily tanks Arceus-Dark's moves and threatens a KO with Brave Bird.
- Xerneas boosts faster than Arceus-Dark on the first Geomancy and threatens an easy KO with Moonblast.
- Arceus-Fairy easily wins a Calm Mind war thanks to resisting Arceus-Dark's Judgment and having a super effective Judgment in return. Other Fairy-types like Sylveon and Mega Mawile also resist Arceus-Dark's and threaten to quickly KO with their STAB moves. Mega Mawile comes with the added benefit of being immune to Sludge Bomb.
- Fighting-types, particularly Mega Blaziken, Mega Lucario, Arceus-Fight, Terrakion, and Mega Mewtwo-X threaten an easy KO with their super effective STAB moves, particularly if they're physical attackers. Terrakion and Lucario can even nab an Attack boost thanks to Justified.
- Tyranitar (especially Low Kick versions) resist Arceus-Dark's STAB and KO easily in return.
- Specially defensive Kyogre can tank Arceus-Dark and phaze it out.
