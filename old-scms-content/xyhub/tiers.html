<div class="author">By <a href="/forums/members/jukain.77748">Jukain</a>. Updated by <a href="/forums/members/trc.203593/">TRC</a> and <a href="/forums/members/mattl.205566/">MattL</a>. Basis for clauses taken from the <a href="/bw/banlist">BW banlist page</a>.</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Tiers are Smogon's way of categorizing Pok&eacute;mon based on usage. Pok&eacute;mon can be banned from the tier or move up to higher tier from their usage. Typically, they are updated after three months of usage statistics from Smogon's simulator, <a href="/sim/">Pok&eacute;mon Showdown</a>. The initial tiers that will be endorsed by Smogon in XY are OverUsed (OU), Ubers, Little Cup (LC), and Doubles. As the generation progresses, tiers under OU will be progressively added to the mix (UnderUsed [UU], RarelyUsed [RU], and NeverUsed [NU] most likely), but for now, these are all of the officially supported tiers.</p>
    
<h2>Ubers</h2>
    <p>Ubers is a tier that has no limits besides the most basic ones; only the necessary clauses for metagame balance restrict what players can use. No Pok&eacute;mon are banned, essentially.</p>
    <h3>Play Restrictions</h3>
        <ul>
             <li><strong>Endless Battle Clause:</strong> Any moveset on any Pok&eacute;mon that is capable of intentionally causing an endless battle is banned from competitive play. Thus:
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>A Pok&eacute;mon may not carry Recycle and hold a Leppa Berry in conjunction with Heal Pulse and Milk Drink, Moonlight, Morning Sun, Recover, Roost, Slack Off, Soft-Boiled, or Wish.</li>
                <li>A Pok&eacute;mon may not hold a Leppa Berry and carry Recycle and Pain Split on its moveset.</li>
                <li>A Pok&eacute;mon may not hold a Leppa Berry and carry Recycle and Fling on its moveset.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Moody Clause:</strong> Pok&eacute;mon with the ability Moody are not permitted.</li>
            <li><strong>OHKO Clause:</strong> A Pok&eacute;mon may not have the moves Fissure, Guillotine, Horn Drill, or Sheer Cold in its moveset.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep Clause:</strong> Only one Pok&eacute;mon may be put to sleep on the opposing team at a time, if not induced by a move such as Rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Species Clause:</strong> Players cannot have two Pok&eacute;mon with the same Pokédex number on the same team.</li>
            <li>Pok&eacute;mon may be up to level 100.</li>
        </ul>

<h2>OverUsed</h2>
    <p>OverUsed, or OU, is Smogon's standard tier. The highest level of play is generally seen in this tier, and it is the basis for all other tiers. The most powerful Pok&eacute;mon are banned from this tier up to Ubers. Pok&eacute;mon cannot rise from OU to Ubers based on usage. Most of the cover legendaries in addition to select other Pok&eacute;mon are on the banlist.</p>

<h2>UnderUsed</h2>
    <p>UnderUsed, or UU, is the tier that contains all of the Pok&eacute;mon that are just short of OU in terms of the required usage amount, which equates to a 50% chance of encountering the Pok&eacute;mon in OU in 20 battles. These Pok&eacute;mon can still be used in OU, and a lot of them are actually quite powerful as well, but they simply aren't used enough for them to change their tier placement.</p>

<h2>Little Cup</h2>
    <p>Little Cup was a battle mode introduced in DP. Numerous players took a liking to it, and it eventually became an official Smogon tier. It is played at level 5 with the lowest possible evolutions of a Pok&eacute;mon. Pok&eacute;mon with no evolutions are banned.</p>

<h2>Doubles</h2>
    <p>A Smogon brand of Doubles was added to the list of tiers this generation. It follows standard Smogon clauses and rules, allowing 6 Pok&eacute;mon per team (and in-battle) that can be up to level 100. Due to these factors, it is much different from the popular Smogon- and Nintendo-endorsed VGC metagame.</p>
