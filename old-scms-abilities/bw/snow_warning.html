[SHORT DESC]
Summons permanent hail.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Causes hail weather upon entering the battlefield. Instead of lasting 5 turns, it lasts the entire match, unless another weather is activated. If two weather inducers are sent out at the same time, the slower of the two will have their weather set up over the faster one. If hail weather was already induced via <a href="/bw/moves/hail">Hail</a>, sending out a Pokemon with Snow Warning will make hail indefinite. Snow Warning will immediately activate whenever the ability is acquired, such as through <a href="/bw/moves/skill_swap">Skill Swap</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/role_play">Role Play</a>.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Hail is a really underrated weather, and it definitely has a lot of use in OU currently. Ice is a great attacking type and despite it being horrible defensively, being able to prevent other weathers going up is a big plus. <a href="/bw/pokemon/abomasnow">Abomasnow</a> isn't exactly awful either, being able to check Water-types with its Ice / Grass typing. 100% accurate <a href="/bw/moves/blizzard">Blizzard</a> is always nice to have as well.</p>
