[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If rain is the prevailing weather condition, the wielder heals 1/16 of its maximum HP at the end of each turn.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rain Dish is a very good ability with rain seemingly being everywhere, so you will likely run into it. The main user is <a href="/bw/pokemon/tentacruel">Tentacruel</a>, who enjoys the recovery as it doesn't get any reliable recovery outside of <a href="/bw/moves/rest">Rest</a> and <a href="/bw/items/leftovers">Leftovers</a> otherwise. <a href="/bw/pokemon/ludicolo">Ludicolo</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/blastoise">Blastoise</a> are both great users of Rain Dish as well, and all three are good options for a rain stall team if you ever consider making one.</p>
