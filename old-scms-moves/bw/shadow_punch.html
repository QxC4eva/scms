<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers. Damage is boosted to 1.2x by the ability Iron Fist.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Shadow Punch is an outclassed move. It is almost never used as a coverage move due to the existence of Shadow Claw, which has higher Base Power and a higher critical hit ratio. Another detriment to Shadow Punch is the fact that most of the Pokemon who receive Shadow Punch are either specially-based attackers, like the Gengar family, or rarely have an attacking move outside of Night Shade, like Dusclops. However, Shadow Punch does find use, almost ironically, on more Pokemon as a physical Ghost STAB move than Shadow Claw does. Thanks to Iron Fist, Golurk can make great use of Shadow Punch as a reliable STAB move alongside Earthquake and Focus Punch for coverage. Dusknoir, who lacks Shadow Claw in its movepool, also enjoys Shadow Punch in its arsenal, particularly in RU, where with some Attack investment ensures the 2HKO on Cryogonal, one of the most dangerous spinners in the tier.</p>
