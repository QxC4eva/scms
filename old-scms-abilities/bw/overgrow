<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is at 1/3 HP or less, all of its Grass-type moves will have 50% more power.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Most Grass-type starters, thanks to the Dream World, now have far better abilities than Overgrow. <a href="/bw/pokemon/venusaur">Venusaur</a> now has <a href="/bw/abilities/chlorophyll">Chlorophyll</a>, and while its usefulness is debatable, <a href="/bw/pokemon/sceptile">Sceptile</a> has <a href="/bw/abilities/unburden">Unburden</a>. <a href="/bw/pokemon/torterra">Torterra</a> really can pick and choose between Overgrow and <a href="/bw/abilities/shell_armor">Shell Armor</a> so if you do see it, that will be the Pokemon you see it with. <a href="/bw/pokemon/serperior">Serperior</a> has Overgrow as its only ability, but once it gets <a href="/bw/abilities/contrary">Contrary</a> from Dream World, the chances of you seeing it use Overgrow are next to nothing.</p>
