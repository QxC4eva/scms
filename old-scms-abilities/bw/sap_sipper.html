[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sap Sipper grants an immunity to all Grass-type moves that target the wielder, including status moves such as <a href="/bw/moves/spore">Spore</a>, and gives a one stage boost to Attack when hit by a Grass-type move. <a href="/bw/moves/bullet_seed">Bullet Seed</a> will only activate Sap Sipper once. <a href="/bw/moves/aromatherapy">Aromatherapy</a> does not target any specific Pokemon, so it does not activate Sap Sipper. The Grass-type immunity to <a href="/bw/moves/leech_seed">Leech Seed</a> has priority over Sap Sipper, so a Grass-type Pokemon with Sap Sipper (such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/sawsbuck">Sawsbuck</a>) that is targeted by Leech Seed will not receive an Attack boost. <a href="/bw/moves/worry_seed">Worry Seed</a>'s effect is negated by Sap Sipper. If a Pokemon with Sap Sipper is at +6 Attack and is targeted by a Grass-type move, it will still be immune to the Grass-type attack but will not receive further Attack boosts.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/azumarill">Azumarill</a> is weak to Grass-type attacks, but it is unlikely to do anything at all with its stats unboosted, so <a href="/bw/abilities/huge_power">Huge Power</a> is by far the more reliable option. On the other Pokemon who get it, however, it is a great ability. With Sap Sipper, <a href="/bw/pokemon/bouffalant">Bouffalant</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/sawsbuck">Sawsbuck</a> in particular are granted many switch-in opportunities into many popular Grass-type moves. The Attack boost is invaluable, and should you be able to switch in on a Grass-type, you can easily get a sweep going. Overall, while most Pokemon who get this ability have other options, Sap Sipper has more than enough qualities to be worth a consideration.</p>
