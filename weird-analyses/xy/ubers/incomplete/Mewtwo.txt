Special 3 stacks
########
name: Special 3 stacks
move 1: Psystrike
move 2: Taunt / Calm Mind
move 3: Fire Blast / Focus Blast
move 4: Focus Blast / Ice Beam / Shadow Ball
ability: Pressure
item: Mewtwonite Y / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

- Psystrike is good STAB and gets around special walls
- Taunt prevents status, phazing, healing, etc. Can also block Defog for offensive teams relying on SR
- Calm Mind = awesome power and very nice special bulk. Can save Mewtwo from revenge kills by Special mons.
- Fire Blast hits Steel-types that resist Psystrike, not to mention Grass and Ice types, good in sun
- Focus Blast hits Steels, hits Heatran and Dialga best and is better vs Darkrai/Darkceus, also doesn't suck in rain
- Ice Beam hits Flying, Dragon and Ground types, is nice with Fire Blast
- Shadow Ball pairs nicely with Focus Blast
- Grass Knot can be used to hit Ground, Rock and Water types particularly hard
- Recover can be used for longevity, but leaves you with worse coverage and finding space to Recover can be hard

Set Details
========

- Gotta be fast and strong
- If Mewtwo Y, use 80 HP / 252 SpA / 176+ Spe to outspeed base 130s
- Can use Leftovers and a 252 HP spread with CM

Usage Tips
========

- KO weakened stuff or things you have super effective coverage for
-

Team Options
========

- U-turn and Volt Switch to get in
- Groudon = sun + physical attacks
- SR great ofc, especially for Ho-Oh and Yveltal


Physical 3 attacks
########
name: Physical 3 attacks
move 1: Low Kick
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Zen Headbutt / Earthquake
move 4: Ice Beam / Stone Edge
ability: Pressure
item: Mewtwonite X
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

- Low Kick is strong as hell since Ubers is the fattest tier, be very afraid. Furthermore STAB
- Zen Headbutt is STAB and just generally hits stuff that isn't hurt by Low Kick pretty well
- EQ hits Aegislash and not much else
- Ice Beam destroys Lando/Gliscor, and hits just about all physical walls super effectively (Lugia, Groudon, Giratina, etc)
- Stone Edge destroys Ho-Oh and generally hits Flying types nicely
- Rock Slide is more accurate but less powerful than Stone Edge, dealing 80% min to max def Ho-Oh and OHKOing most sets, but is weak against Lugia
- Poison Jab or Iron Tail hit Fairies the hardest, but lack other targets

Set Details
========

- Max Atk/Speed because in the game of Mewtwo, you KO or you die

Usage Tips
========

- Switch in
- Kill

Team Options
========

- Mons that handle Fairies
- SR is fun


Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Drain Punch / Low Kick
move 3: Zen Headbutt / Rock Slide
move 4: Taunt / Rock Slide
ability: Pressure
item: Mewtwonite X
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

- Bulk Up makes MMX hard to take down with physical attacks and makes it very strong
- Drain Punch keeps MMX alive and is decent STAB
- Low Kick is ridiculous with a boost
- Zen Headbutt is secondary STAB
- Rock Slide provides great coverage alongside Drain Punch, although Aegislash still walls you
- Taunt stops phazing, status, etc
- Stone Edge can be used instead of Rock Slide for more power, although it's usually not relevant after a boost and the accuracy sucks

Set Details
========

- Needs all the speed and power it can get

Usage Tips
========

- Idk

Team Options

Stalltwo
########
name: Stalltwo
move 1: Psystrike
move 2: Will-o-Wisp
move 3: Recover
move 4: Taunt
ability: Unnerve
item: Leftovers / Mewtwonite Y
evs: 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

- Psystrike is STAB so it can deal some damage outside of burns
- Will-o-Wisp cripples physical attackers and does nice residual damage
- Recover heals Mewtwo so it can keep crippling stuff
- Taunt prevents walls healing and mons crippling Mewtwo with status

Set Details
========

- Enough speed to outspeed Arceus, rest in physical bulk to handle physical attackers (esp Ekiller) better before a burn
- If Mewtwo Y, use 252 HP / 80 SDef / 176+ Spe, allowing it to outspeed base 130s, with the rest in special bulk as its physical bulk is hopeless

Usage Tips
========

- stuff

Team Options
========

- stuff

Other Options
########

- Thunder is kinda strong, but Grass Knot/Ice beam hit its targets and the accuracy sucks out of rain
- Hurricane is strong but lacks targets between Psystrike and Fireblast, also horrible accuracy out of rain
- Dual Screens would be cool but needs a way to prevent Defog
- Substitute eases prediction and does a lot of stuff Taunt does but the HP is precious, as is the moveslot
