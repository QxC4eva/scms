        Hello!
    </p>

    <p>
        A new year just rolled in, and with it a new issue of The Smog! It almost feels like it was just a couple of weeks ago that I was writing the previous Note From the Editor, but it's actually been almost two months since then &mdash; time sure flies by!
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyhow, issue #32 comes in very balanced in terms of featured content, with the Metagame category taking the lead with nine articles written for it. Some of these include: Predictions for XY RU, XY Doubles Standouts, BW2 RU Suspect Results, and others. Battling Strategy didn't fall behind either, with really cool articles such as DPP OU Underrated Movesets and Switching in Doubles taking the spotlight. The Entertainment, Arts, and Other Features sections also received a respectable variety of content. All in all, there's something for every type of audience in here, and we hope you enjoy what we've put together for you this time. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Before I wrap this up, I'd like to thank one of our artists, <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/members/elcheeso.88763/">elcheeso</a>, for the absolutely stunning artwork that became this issue's cover; it's really cool. Finally as a reminder, when you're done reading, feel free to stop by <a href="/forums/forums/79/">The Smog's subforum</a> and drop us a comment or two on what you think about this issue, which articles you liked the most, or just become a contributor to our next edition of the magazine!
    </p>

    <p>
        We hope you're having a great start of the year. Cheers!
    </p>
