[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a critical hit rate one stage higher than normal. Assuming there are no other critical hit modifiers in play, this move has a 1/8 chance to get a critical hit instead of a 1/16 chance.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Stone Edge is one of the most important moves in the game. It has near perfect coverage with Earthquake, also known as the EdgeQuake combination. However, many players proclaim Stone Edge to be the worst attack in the game due to its disappointingly low PP, 80% accuracy, and, as such, its penchant for missing at the worst times possible. Still, the move is vital for powerful physical attackers such as Landorus, Tyranitar, and Terrakion, the latter two receiving a valuable STAB boost on it. It also appreciates an elevated critical hit ratio, as it can decimate certain opponents if it lands a critical hit.</p>

<h2>Related Moves</h2>
