    Moves
    ========

        Judgment for STAB damage which has pretty good coverage all alone thanks to the steel nerf.
        Calm Mind is self explanatory. Setup vs special attackers, and sometimes even vs physical attackers, and attempt to sweep.
        Refresh makes it a good stall breaker and makes sure status dosen't stop it from sweeping. It also acts as status absorber.It can help win CM wars vs other Arceus formes.
        Sludge bomb gives coverage vs fairy types and can catch them by surprise,and can help win CM wars thanks to the poison chance.
        Recover for longevity, which helps a bulky Pokemon like this a lot and makes sweeps more effective, as well as dealing with stall teams.

    Set Details
    ========

        Max HP to tank as hard as possible.
        96+ speed to outspeed 100 base speed Pokemon.
        Rest dumped in Sdef to make sure it can tank special attackers better

    Usage tips
    ========

        Arceus' main niche is to switch in Palkia, which has a very good coverage and can hit almost everything in the tier for SE damage. Switch it in special attackers and then recover+cm.
        It can switch into MMY since even aura sphere fails to 2hko. In return,you can either use judgment, or setup CM and then recover,and then go for the kill, although watch out for focus blast MMY, which is unreliable, but can 2HKO it.
        It's better for scout for the Mewtwo forme if it's unknown since MMX can deal pretty handy damage, so when a normal Mewtwo switches in Darkceus, scout it with your fight resisting mon/something that can take special hits well.
        Arceus-Dark appreciates Stealth rock and spikes removal since it other can get 2hkoed at times before it can recover, although it's not that crucial to remove hazards from the field for it.
        It's good to switch it into any status stall mon, since it can easily deal with them thanks to refresh, so Arceus-Dark functions well as a stall breaker at times with refresh.

    Team Options
    ========

        Lugia is a good teammate,being able to handle stuff like Mega Mewtwo X and Blaziken,which threaten Arceus-Dark.
        Steel types like Aegislash and Scizor help with Arceus-Dark's fairy weakness.

    Other Options
    ========

        A support moveset can be used with moves like perish song, defog, toxic, thunder wave, stealth rock, magic coat, roar and will-o-wisp etc.
        Stone Edge can be used as a surprise factor for Ho-oh,which can easily tank Arceus-Dark other wise.
        Substitute can be used over refresh on the Calm Mind moveset, but toxic spikes become a problem
