<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage equal to half the target's current HP, rounded down. If used against a foe with 1 HP, Super Fang will do 1 HP damage, KOing the target. Super Fang isn't affected by STAB, weakness, resistance, or any other factors. Ghost-type Pokemon are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Super Fang is a helpful attack for Pokemon that have a hard time muscling through tougher walls and lack better forms of coverage. The best example around is Crobat, who loves using Super Fang to soften up Registeel and Bronzong. Walrein is also a notable user; should Stallrein find itself with a free turn, it can speed up the arduously long process of KOing a foe through hail damage.</p>
