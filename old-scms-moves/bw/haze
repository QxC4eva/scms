<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This move removes stat, accuracy, and evasion modifiers from every Pokemon on the field. This move does not count as a stat reduction for the purposes of Clear Body or White Smoke.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While Haze is one of the most effective ways to remove stat boosts, it has bad distribution. It is mostly outclassed by Roar and Whirlwind due to their also picking up entry hazard damage into the bargain, should you have lain them down. However, Haze has the advantage of having normal priority, which benefits Murkrow, who can remove boosts before it gets hit, thanks to its Prankster ability. Milotic, who does not learn Roar or Whirlwind, can use Haze and its excellent bulk to take a hit and remove any stat boosts. Blastoise can do the same thing.</p>
