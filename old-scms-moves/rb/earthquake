<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Earthquake, one of the best moves in the game. It has high Base Power, perfect accuracy, and no harmful side-effects. Furthermore, it hits many things hard: only Bug- and Grass-types resist it, and only Flying-types are immune. When paired with Rock Slide, it forms a combo that attains superb neutral coverage as well. It is not surprising that many Pokemon make use of this move in their arsenal, and most Ground-types that get it have high Attack to back it. Not many Pokemon want to face a STAB Earthquake, and it is unwise to leave one's team susceptible to Ground-type moves.</p>
