Doubles Clamperl's Special Attack. Evolves Clamperl into Huntail.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If held by Clamperl, its Special Attack stat is doubled in battle. If Clamperl is traded while holding this item, it will evolve into Huntail.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Clamperl, the strongest. With DeepSeaTooth equipped, the tiny little clam's STAB Water-type attacks are even stronger than those of Palkia (which makes very little sense, but there you go). Very few Pokemon can avoid being 2HKOed... especially in Little Cup. The only trouble is, of course, that Clamperl is slow as slow can be, but this can be remedied with Trick Room support, or Shell Smash. Don't expect Clamperl to last too long, though.</p>
