<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cures burn. One-time use. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Grass-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The Rawst Berry isn't that great an item. Burn is a nasty status and can grind a sweeper to a halt with ease, but if your Pokemon happens to be paralyzed or poisoned, then this item goes to waste. Typically, Lum Berry is favored as it enables the Pokemon to recover from any status—not just burn—once, which is more beneficial to those susceptible to it.</p>
