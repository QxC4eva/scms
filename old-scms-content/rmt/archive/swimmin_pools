<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This team is basically the embodiment of the the broken rain-dominant late bw2 scene. The idea is, throw together a bunch of rain sweepers and profit. With some of the biggest names in rain such as Toed, TornT, Keldeo, ThundT and an underused abuser azumarill, this team packs the firepower to absolutely overwhelm opposing weathers. I gave this team to my buddy GaryTheGengar for his ladder run during the TornT + Keldeo suspect, and he unsurprisingly achieved req's within hours with a record of around 70-5 with the few losses resulting from either hax or terrible matchup. He is a phenomenal ladder playe, and his record also goes to show the potential of this team. Later on in the suspect test my good friend Shurtugal also went 60-15 ish while I gave up after going 30-2 due to my impatience with d/c's and various bugs and glitches (no hate towards ps though, still the fourth best pokemon simulator behind po, netbattle, and shoddy. Maaayyyybe rsbots too ;])</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Terrakion</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Justified<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>First off its the lead terrakion. This set is very self explanatory, as all you have to do is sash a hit for rocks or sd on the switch to cruel forre etc and knock them out then get rocks. This set has a great matchup with most teams and is my usual lead. Stealth Rocks cuz it's the best move in the game, 2 attacks that form arguably the best coverage, and sd for boosting on predicted switches to kill bulky shit. </p>

<p><strong>Politoed</strong> @ Water Gem<br />
Ability: Drizzle<br />
EVs: 216 HP / 252 SpA / 40 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Hidden Power Grass<br />
- Psychic</p>

<p>Politoed is of course the obligatory rain starter that runs the metagame at its current state. Since my team is so offensive in its natur i didnt want a soft hitting mon giving anything setup opportunities, namely croaker and dragons, therefore I slapped on a water gem to fake choice and dish out that spex hydro when needed. This set works amazingly well in luring in mons that set up on it and killing them. Using anything but hydro will fake a choiced item, and so will using hydro on croak/gastro. Then you simply bust out the super effective move and kill the switchin or severly damage them. I run enough speed for almost all bandtar who think they can switch into a choiced icebeam and pursuit, and are then drowned in a gem boosted hydro pump. This is also my backup croak killer, being able to kill croaks reliably by faking choiced item. </p>

<p><strong>Tornadus-T</strong> @ Choice Specs<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe <br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Sleep Talk<br />
- Hurricane<br />
- U-turn<br />
- None / Focus Blast</p>

<p>TornadusT. What else can you say about this fiend. Spex hurricain absolutely demolishes anything that isn't murdered by my water powerhouses. Regenerator is broken AS FUCK and is 300% abusable especially with choice spex meaning you GAIN 5% for switching into rocks. not even lucario can not give as much of a fuck about rocks as tornT. On top of that this thing switches into grass types for ages, scouts like a tournament player, and brings momentum like no other mon. Most teams are one uturn away from eating a faceful of rain boosted Waterfals/hydros. Hands down uber material, and as much as I enjoy abusing it, TornT is almost as broken as my previous subject genesect and has to go ubers.</p>

<p><strong>Thundurus-T</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Volt Absorb<br />
EVs: 152 HP / 252 SpA / 104 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Agility<br />
- Thunder<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>This thing is an absolute monster. Once again shoutout to my boy Gr8 for introducing me to the set because it is surprisingly bulky and often times sets up +2 +2 and proceeds to shit on the metagame. Water types that try to come in on toed and keldeo are an open invite to double switch to Thund and dish out MASSIVE amounts of pain. After a nasty plot and a bit of pior damage ferrothorn is 2hkoed by thunder, and pretty much only gastrodon and life orb latis can hold back this beast.....temporarily. +2 Thunder absolutely demolishes ttar so there's no way it'll be switching in unless it's at full health, and ninetails is easily destroyed by it. It lives aboma's ishard comfortably and dispatches it with +2 hp ice/thunder. Perhaps the best check to it is mamoswine but with a team full of heavy hitting waters and fightings thundurus will not be an open invite for mamo to start rampaging. </p>

<p><strong>Keldeo</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Justified<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Surf<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Secret Sword<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>Keldeo is pretty much the best scarfer in the metagame because it hits so hard for having its boosted speed and reliably revenges a plethora of threats. The lategame sweeping potential of rain keldeo is enormous, especially with dedicated team support. This is the classic and pretty much standard set, it reenges dragons, punches wholes with its great coverage and lures in bait for tornT and thundT to have fun (ie. celebi, jelli, cruel, ferro etc) With the 1-2 punch of keldeo and azumarill, my team has never had a problem sweeping up half dead pokes lategame. After Keldeos counters have been weakened there is literally very little that can be done to stop it as its natural bulk shrugs off most all priority and outspeeds basicall the entire tier. </p>

<p><strong>Azumarill</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Huge Power<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Aqua Jet<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Frustration</p>

<p>This thing hits like a fuckin truck in rain and allows ZERO setup despite being choice locked. I didnt like superpower because it is set up fodder, and frustration ohkos croak, so the change was simple. The thing with using 4 heavy hitters that compliment eachother perfectly is to double switch frequently and spam attacks with the one that does the most damage to the opponent's team. Common walls to rain like ferro, cruel, jelli, latis, celebi, amoong cannot stand up to the core of torn thund keld azu because they simply hit too hard and gain momentum too quickly for the opponent to recover. The absurdly powerful late game aquajet also serves as my secondary win condition and has swept way more teams than azu gets credit for. His bulk along with enormous strength complements the team perfectly and is a great last piece in the puzzle </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This team was very fun and effective to use, but unfortunately, suspect testing will likely mark the end of a torn + keld dominated rain era. This team has been very successful during this period and I would like to retire it to commemorate the broken metagame as the end of bw2 draws near. Shoutouts to GaryTheGengar who inspired the rain hyper offense playstyle for me and for playtesting the team and even using it to great success in tours, Gr8 who has constantly been giving me great sets and ideas, and Shurtugal who has always been supportive of my teams and who is one of the best teambuilding partners around ;] Also shoutout to the <strong>Ruiners</strong> for being HARD BODY BALLINâ€‹</p>
