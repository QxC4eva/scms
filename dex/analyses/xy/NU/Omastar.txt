Overview
########

Omastar has access to every entry hazard except for Sticky Web; arguably the best boosting move in the game, Shell Smash; and a wide array of attacking moves such as Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Earth Power. Omastar also has high Special Attack and Defense stats, as well as usable abilities in Swift Swim and Weak Armor. However, Omastar is held back by its low special bulk, making it hard to use against special attackers. And while Omastar has good defensive typing in most cases, that typing also gives it a 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks.

Entry Hazard Setter
########
name: Entry Hazard Setter
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Spikes
move 3: Scald
move 4: Ice Beam / Stone Edge / Icy Wind
ability: Weak Armor
item: Focus Sash
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Naive

Moves
========

Stealth Rock and Spikes are both great entry hazards that can slowly wear down the opponent's team. Scald is a good STAB move that is mostly used for the high burn chance, which can potentially cripple physical threats such as Feraligatr and Sawk. Ice Beam is a good coverage move that hits Dragalge and Grass-types hard. Stone Edge with a Naive nature is also an option in order to 2HKO Mantine and Cryogonal. Icy Wind is also viable, as it slows down potential sweepers. Ancient Power hits physically defensive Mantine, and is a good secondary STAB move that has a small chance to raise all of Omastar's stats. Lastly, Toxic Spikes can be used over Omastar's second coverage move in order to set a hazard that poisons the opponent's Pokemon.

Set Details
========

A Focus Sash guarantees that Omastar sets up at least one entry hazard. Weak Armor is the chosen ability as it gives Omastar a free Speed boost if Omastar is hit with a physical attack. Max Special Attack investment lets Omastar hit as hard as possible before it faints, while the rest of the EVs are put in Speed with a Timid nature to be as quick as possible. A Naive nature should be used if Stone Edge is run.

Usage Tips
========

This set functions best as a lead. Stealth Rock should be the first entry hazard used, as there tier contains are many Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon, such as Vivillon and Typhlosion. Spikes should be used next. Omastar can use its offensive presence to deter setup sweepers and/or opposing hazard setters, which is one of the things that makes Omastar a good hazard setter.

Team Options
========

Ghost-types such as Mismagius, Spiritomb, Rotom, and Haunter can help keep Omastar's entry hazards up as long as possible. Pawniard is also a good teammate, as it gets a free Defiant boost from switching into Defog. Although Omastar doesn't need to stay on the field as long as possible, teammates such as Bouffalant and Sawsbuck can take advantage of a predicted Grass-type move and get a free Attack boost from Sap Sipper. Lastly, sweepers such as Feraligatr can make great use of Omastar's hazards, as they can score more OHKOs with them.

Shell Smash
########
name: Shell Smash
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Hidden Power Grass
ability: Weak Armor
item: Life Orb / Lum Berry
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Shell Smash boosts both Omastar's Special Attack and Speed stats. Hydro Pump is an insanely powerful STAB move, especially after a Shell Smash. Ice Beam hits Flying- and Grass-types. Hidden Power Grass hits Water-types, most notably Seimsitoad. Earth Power can be used to hit Lanturn harder, but Hidden Power Grass generally offers better coverage.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature with 252 Speed EVs maxes out Omastar's Speed, making it very fast after a Shell Smash. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize Omastar's damage output. Weak Armor works well with Shell Smash, as Omastar can take a physical hit and Shell Smash on the same turn, bringing it to +3 Speed. A Lum Berry is the preferred item to stop crippling paralysis and sleep, though a Life Orb can be used to hit even harder.

Usage Tips
========

Omastar is usually pretty strong before a Shell Smash, so attacking without setting up and switching out is usually ideal before every check and counter to it is gone, as Omastar doesn't want to be forced out after setting up. Omastar can force switches on Pokemon such as Pyroar and Magmortar and then set up on the switch. It's best to set up on Choice-locked Fire-types such as Typhlosion, weaker walls such as Granbull, weaker physical attackers such as Crustle, and setup sweepers that haven't set up yet, such as Swords Dance Feraligatr.

Team Options
========

Omastar does a fantastic job of luring in Grass-types, so Sawsbuck and Bouffalant are great teammates, as they can take a Grass-type move for a free Attack boost with Sap Sipper. Dragalge can use Sludge Wave to get rid of Ludicolo, which can shrug off any of Omastar's attacks even after a Shell Smash. Dual screens support lets Omastar set up much more easily. Wallbreakers such as Typhlosion and Magmortar are great partners as they can eliminate Omastar's checks and counters very easily. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Accelgor and Crustle are great, as they can wear down Omastar's checks. One layer of Spikes can assure the 2HKO on Spiritomb with an unboosted Hydro Pump, and increases the chance of a 2HKO on Dragalge with an unboosted Ice Beam to 85%.

Other Options
########

Ancient Power could be used as a STAB move on the Shell Smash set, but Ice Beam hits most of the relevant threats Ancient Power hits, apart from physically defensive Mantine. Omastar can lure in Ferroseed and do some major damage to it with Hidden Power Fire. Omastar has good enough physical bulk to run a physically defensive set, but it would much rather be doing other things. A Swift Swim set with a Life Orb or Lum Berry can work, as a Hydro Pump under rain hits like a nuke. Shell Armor and a White Herb can help Omastar retain more bulk after using Shell Smash.

Checks & Counters
########

**Taunt**: Taunt users such as Liepard can hurt entry hazard-setting Omastar by preventing it from doing its job.

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Hariyama, Dragalge, and Lanturn can take Omastar's attacks well.

**Ludicolo**: Ludicolo can take any hit from Omastar even after Shell Smash and OHKO it with a Grass-type STAB move.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Lanturn laugh at Omastar's attacks unless it packs Hidden Power Grass. Mantine gets a special mention as it takes low damage from any of Omastar's attacks, apart from Stone Edge.

**Bullet Seed**: Users of Bullet Seed such as Cacturne and Torterra can use it to OHKO lead Omastar because Bullet Seed breaks its Focus Sash.

**Revenge Killers**: Revenge killers such as Rotom, Choice Scarf users such as Pyroar, and priority users such as Gurdurr can check Shell Smash Omastar.

**Defog**: Swanna, Pelipper, Togetic, Vullaby, and Mantine can all outspeed Omastar and use Defog to render its entry hazards useless.
