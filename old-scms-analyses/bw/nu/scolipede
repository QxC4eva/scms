[Overview]

<p>Since its arrival in the NU tier, Scolipede has single-handedly defined Spikes-stacking offensive teams thanks to its combination of fantastic Speed, above average Attack, and a high Base Power STAB move. What makes it even more fearsome is its versatility; Scolipede has a wide variety of viable moves to utilize, and it can even run a bulkier spread or a boosting sweeper set. In fact, one of Scolipede's only drawbacks—its typing—can also be played to its advantage. Despite some weaknesses to common attacking types, Scolipede also boasts a 4x resistance to Fighting- and Grass-type moves that can help it set up against many of the tier's common threats.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Scolipede's most popular set, and for good reason: its combination of great Speed, power, and coverage makes it both a great Spikes user and a great attacker. Spikes is the first move on this set, and it's by far the most important one. Scolipede's ability to get up Spikes quickly is what makes it so effective. Megahorn is the best STAB Scolipede has, and it's used to compensate a bit for Scolipede's Attack stat, which is decent at best. Aqua Tail hits Pokemon that Scolipede otherwise struggles to defeat, such as Golurk, and has great neutral coverage alongside its Bug-type STAB. Swords Dance allows Scolipede to increase its offensive potential and put serious dents in an opposing team, giving it a choice between setting up Spikes or sweeping depending on the situation. However, Rock Slide can be used instead to hit Flying-types for super effective damage, while having a nice chance to flinch which works well with congruence with Scolipede's fantastic Speed. It's worth noting that either Swords Dance or Rock Slide works fine with Life Orb, but as Rock Slide isn't very strong without a boost, only Swords Dance should be used with Focus Sash.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Basically the only moves that should always be on this set are Megahorn and Spikes; anything else can be changed to fit your team's needs. Pursuit works well on Life Orb sets to pick off Pokemon such as Jynx, but it doesn't have much use otherwise. Earthquake is in a very similar boat, as it can hit Poison-types, such as Garbodor, for super effective damage, but it doesn't serve much use outside of this. Finally, Toxic Spikes are fantastic on Scolipede, but it often struggles to find a slot for it. The choice in item is also very reliant upon your team's needs; Life Orb allows Scolipede to pack an immediate punch, but if setting Spikes is more important for your team, you're better off running Focus Sash for a nearly guaranteed two layers. You can also run Bug Gem on this set in order to OHKO Musharna after it has taken two layers of Spikes damage. Perhaps the only thing that you shouldn't ever really change is the ability. Swarm is almost always the clear choice, as the added power that Megahorn receives is notable when it is in range of getting a boost, while Poison Point is unreliable and Quick Feet is only really beneficial in case of paralysis.</p>

<p>Finding partners for Scolipede isn't exactly a difficult task; Spikes are appreciated on almost every team. However, some Pokemon work exceptionally well with it. Seismitoad, for example, has access to the only hazard Scolipede doesn't—Stealth Rock—and can take on Fire- and Rock-type attacks, while Scolipede can take Grass-type attacks. Strong special attackers can also muscle past most of the tier's physical walls, which tend to give Scolipede problems. Good examples of these include Samurott, Eelektross, and Ludicolo. Offensive sweepers that appreciate their checks and counters weakened work well alongside this set, as the Spikes that Scolipede sets can help accomplish just that. For this reason, many different Pokemon, including Swellow, Choice Scarf Jynx, and Calm Mind Serperior, appreciate the support that Scolipede provides. Finally, because this set has troubles setting hazards multiple times throughout a match, a Ghost-type can be helpful to block Rapid Spin and keep entry hazards up on your opponent's side of the field. Misdreavus is a great defensive spinblocker, and SubDisable Haunter and Destiny Bond Drifblim make good offensive spinblockers.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While it might seem outclassed by other Spikes users, such as Garbodor and Roselia, a bulkier spread also works well on Scolipede, sacrificing some of the immediate power of the offensive set in exchange for more chances to set up hazards. What sets bulky Scolipede apart from other Spikes users is its greater offensive presence and Speed. This set plays best on balanced offensive teams that prefer more consistent hazards over getting them set up more quickly. Both Spikes and Toxic Spikes are used on this set, as they can both be helpful in different situations. Megahorn is used for a STAB move, and it still hits fairly hard even with minimal investment. The choice in the last slot is between Aqua Tail and Toxic. The former has the best two-move coverage alongside Megahorn, while the latter can be used to poison Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate. It also comes in handle during the times when your opponent has a Poison-type to absorb Toxic Spikes, but you still need a means of poisoning the opposing Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on this set serve a few purposes. The Speed EVs allow Scolipede to outspeed up to base 101 Speed Pokemon, including Simisage, Simipour, Simisear, and Charizard, and hit them for heavy damage or set up more hazards before they can attack. The Attack EVs allow Scolipede a chance to 2HKO Musharna with Megahorn and Golurk with Aqua Tail. The remaining EVs are placed in HP and Defense to help it take on opposing attackers. With no reliable recovery, this set appreciates Wish support from bulky Pokemon, such as Alomomola, Lickilicky, and Audino. The last two can also provide Heal Bell support in case Scolipede is hit with an untimely burn or paralysis. Seismitoad has great defensive synergy with Scolipede and can provide Stealth Rock support. Spinblockers make for decent partners, however none of them share much synergy with Scolipede, and this set is able to set hazards multiple times if necessary, making spinblockers less of a necessity. Finally, many NU sweepers appreciate the support from Toxic Spikes in particular to take out certain Pokemon that they would otherwise struggle to beat. Bulk Up Braviary has issues with Rock-type Pokemon; Shell Smash Carracosta with Alomomola, Tangela, and Seismitoad; and Klang with Ground- and Fighting-types.</p>

[SET]
name: SubSalac
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Megahorn
move 4: Aqua Tail / Baton Pass
item: Salac Berry
ability: Swarm
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
ivs: 30 HP

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Scolipede's SubSalac set completely forgoes the utility of Spikes in exchange for the ability to play as a setup sweeper and a stallbreaker. This set is very powerful; even Alomomola, one of the tier's bulkiest physical walls, cannot stomach two Megahorns from a +2 Scolipede. Swords Dance is used as it's Scolipede's best boosting move, propelling its Attack to 612 after one boost. Substitute is used for many reasons—to ease prediction for Scolipede, help it get down to Salac Berry range, and even to be passed on variants with Baton Pass. Megahorn is once again used as Scolipede's most powerful STAB move. Finally, Aqua Tail can be used to round out Scolipede's coverage if you're keen on Scolipede's sweeping ability. However, if you would rather help another teammate sweep, you can use Baton Pass to make sure its Swords Dance and Salac Berry boosts don't go to waste.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Adamant nature is used to help Scolipede reach its full sweeping potential, but more importantly, after a Salac Berry boost, the only common Choice Scarf user it fails to outspeed with an Adamant nature is Charizard. If you would feel more comfortable being able to outspeed Choice Scarf Charizard, a Jolly nature is still a viable alternative. 30 HP IVs are needed to activate Salac Berry after three Substitutes. If you plan to use Baton Pass on this set, you should bring along teammates that appreciate the boosts. Practically any physical attacker with respectable Speed appreciates the boosts; examples include Tauros, Sawk, Sawsbuck, and Kangaskhan. Because of the immense power of this set after it sets up a Swords Dance, it can be difficult to wall. Even so, a few Pokemon are able to take it on well, and having Pokemon to defeat them is always appreciated. Misdreavus is able to take any hit from Scolipede and break its Substitutes with either Foul Play or Shadow Ball, making Dark-type Pokemon, such as Skuntank and mixed Shiftry, good partners to help defeat it. Bastiodon and Weezing can take a hit from even +2 Scolipede and either Roar or Haze away its boosts. Strong special attackers, such as Jynx, can be used to defeat these Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>While Scolipede has many different options for some of its sets, it doesn't have much potential outside of that. Still, there are some additional options you might be considering. A Choice Scarf or Choice Band set might seem appealing, but other Pokemon typically perform these roles better. Iron Defense and Agility seem like interesting options for a dedicated Baton Pass set, but Scolipede's bulk makes it difficult to set up multiple boosts. More importantly, Scolipede typically has much better things to be doing. Endeavor is an option on sets wielding a Focus Sash, bringing the opposing Pokemon down to one HP in many instances. Superpower is an interesting choice, as Fighting-type coverage is rarely a bad thing. However, it really doesn't add much in terms of coverage, and the Attack drop can force you to switch out, losing any offensive momentum you might have gained. Poison Jab is an interesting choice for a secondary STAB to hit Fighting- and Flying-type Pokemon that resist its Bug-type STAB, but outside of this, it's not worth using. Finally, Sunny Day is an interesting option that works well on sun teams with Scolipede's high base Speed, though it is already pressed for moveslots as it is.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>There are few Pokemon that can stop Scolipede from setting at least one layer of Spikes without sacrificing themselves. Golem is one of few, as it is able to Rock Blast Scolipede, ignoring the possibility of a Focus Sash saving it. Misdreavus can handle most Scolipede well, as it can take any unboosted hit easily, break Scolipede's Substitutes, burn it, and Taunt it to keep it from setting up Spikes or boosting with Swords Dance. Golbat can tank multiple Rock Slides from Scolipede, use Roost to recover the damage, Taunt to prevent it from setting up, and retaliate with Brave Bird. Alomomola can take any hit from Scolipede's Spikes sets, but it can't do much to keep it from setting up. Weezing can also take any hit from Scolipede, Haze its boosts away, and attack it with Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Frillish, although a rare sight in NU, can wall almost any move Scolipede has to hit it with and burn it in return. If all else fails, faster Pokemon and those wielding a Choice Scarf can revenge kill it. Jynx, Primeape, Charizard, and Zebstrika all have moves that can OHKO offensive Scolipede, and they all outspeed it with a Choice Scarf, while Swellow can outspeed it without a Choice Scarf and OHKO it with Brave Bird.</p>
