Paralyzes the target.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Paralyzes the target. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>It might not have the best accuracy out there, but Stun Spore is a decent attack. Unlike Thunder Wave, no single elemental type is immune to Grass. Thanks to that attribute, Stun Spore can paralyze every Pokemon in the game outside of Sap Sipper users. Good Stun Spore users include bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss, who can take advantage of a slower opponent.</p>
