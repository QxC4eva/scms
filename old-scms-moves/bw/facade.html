Has 140 power when user is burned, paralyzed, or poisoned.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Base Power doubles when the user is burned, paralyzed, or poisoned. The Attack drop from burn is still applied, unless the user has an ability that ignores the drop, such as Guts.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While the more powerful and consistent Return is a better option than Facade most of the time, Facade is particularly useful on users of status Orbs, as this powers up Facade to a massive 140 Base Power. Swellow and Ursaring are both classic Guts sweepers who appreciate a more powerful Normal-type STAB attack; the Guts boost and Facade's raw power while affected by a status condition go hand in hand. Even Pokemon that don't receive STAB from Facade can still find use for it if they're in need of neutral coverage; Gliscor, for instance, can utilize Facade to achieve decent coverage alongside Earthquake. In UU, Guts Heracross can also use Facade to break through pesky Poison-types.</p>
