<div class="author">By <a href="/forums/members/jukain.77748">Jukain</a>. Updated by <a href="/forums/members/trc.203593/">TRC.</a>. Basis for clauses taken from the <a href="/bw/banlist">BW banlist page</a>.</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Tiers are Smogon's way of categorizing Pokémon based on usage. Pokémon can be banned from the tier or move up to higher tier from their usage. Typically, they are updated after three months of usage statistics from Smogon's simulator, <a href="/sim/">Pokemon Showdown</a>. The initial tiers that will be endorsed by Smogon in XY are OverUsed (OU), Ubers, Little Cup (LC), and Doubles. As the generation progresses, tiers under OU will be progressively added to the mix (UnderUsed [UU], RarelyUsed [RU], and NeverUsed [NU] most likely), but for now, these are all of the officially supported tiers.</p>
    
<h2>Ubers</h2>
    <p>Ubers is a tier that has no limits besides the most basic ones; only the necessary clauses for metagame balance restrict what players can use. No Pokémon are banned, essentially.</p>
    <h3>Play Restrictions</h3>
        <ul>
             <li><strong>Endless Battle Clause:</strong> Any moveset on any Pok&eacute;mon that is capable of intentionally causing an endless battle is banned from competitive play. Thus:
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>A Pok&eacute;mon may not carry Recycle and hold a Leppa Berry in conjunction with Heal Pulse and Milk Drink, Moonlight, Morning Sun, Recover, Roost, Slack Off, Soft-Boiled, or Wish.</li>
                <li>A Pok&eacute;mon may not hold a Leppa Berry and carry Recycle and Pain Split on its moveset.</li>
                <li>A Pok&eacute;mon may not hold a Leppa Berry and carry Recycle and Fling on its moveset.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Moody Clause:</strong> Pokémon with the ability Moody are not permitted.</li>
            <li><strong>OHKO Clause:</strong> A Pokemon may not have the moves Fissure, Guillotine, Horn Drill, or Sheer Cold in its moveset.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep Clause:</strong> Only one Pokémon may be put to sleep on the opposing team at a time, if not induced by a move such as Rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Species Clause:</strong> Players cannot have two Pokémon with the same Pokédex number on the same team.</li>
            <li>Pokémon may be up to level 100.</li>
        </ul>

<h2>OverUsed</h2>
    <p>OverUsed, or OU, is Smogon's standard tier. The highest level of play is generally seen in this tier, and it is the basis for all other tiers. The most powerful Pokémon are banned from this tier up to Ubers. Pokemon cannot rise from OU to Ubers based on usage. Most of the cover legendaries in addition to select other Pokémon are on the banlist.</p>
    <h3>Play Restrictions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Endless Battle Clause:</strong> Any moveset on any Pok&eacute;mon that is capable of intentionally causing an endless battle is banned from competitive play. Thus:

                <li>A Pok&eacute;mon may not hold a Leppa Berry and carry Recycle and Fling on its moveset.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Evasion Clause:</strong> The moves Double Team and Minimize, in addition to the abilities Sand Veil and Snow Cloak, are not permitted in play.</li>

<h2>UnderUsed</h2>
    <p>UnderUsed, or UU, is the tier that contains all of the Pokemon that are just short of OU in terms of the required usage amount, which equates to roughly 1 in 20 battles. These Pokemon can still be used in OU, and a lot of them are actually quite powerful as well, but they simply aren't used enough for them to change their tier placement.</p>

<h2>Little Cup</h2>

<h2>Doubles</h2>
    <p>A Smogon brand of Doubles was added to the list of tiers this generation. It follows standard Smogon clauses and rules, allowing 6 Pokémon per team (and in-battle) that can be up to level 100.
