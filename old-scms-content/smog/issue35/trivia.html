<p>Greetings, Smogon! Welcome to what is not actually another issue of Trivia. What a shame.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed or guessed, it's becoming increasingly hard to make tough and well-thought-out trivia questions each issue, especially when Bulbapedia, Serebii, and Veekun exist. As a result of this, we're discontinuing Trivia. While we haven't been able to push out the replacement in time for this issue, we are proud to announce that starting Issue #36, we will have a Puzzle Page as a replacement for our Trivia section!</p>

<p>In the meantime, to tide you over, here are the answers to last issue's trivia questions. I must say, it was a particularly tough batch last issue, but xfix managed to triumph over the lot, earning a perfect score! Jolly good show, I must say; as a reward, you can approach any administrator to claim your prize of a custom title.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Name a move which originated in Generation I and has changed with each new generation. These changes can be anything you like&mdash;Base Power, type, or mechanics&mdash;though a change constituted solely by an interaction with a newly-introduced ability or move does not count.<br />
<strong>Roar and Whirlwind. In Generation I, both moves worked only on wild Pok&eacute;mon; in Generation II, they also allowed forcing switches in trainer battles and their priority was lowered from 0 to -1; in Generation III, their priority was again lowered to -5; in Generation IV, their priority was lowered to -6; in Generation V, these moves no longer allowed you to escape from wild battles if your Pok&eacute;mon was at a lower level than the wild Pok&eacute;mon; finally, in Generation VI, the moves ignore protection moves and accuracy and evasion modifiers. Bind is also technically an answer if you want to be pedantic; in Generations III and IV, however, the only change was the message shown when the target takes damage from Bind.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Which type is represented by the fewest non-attacking moves?<br />
<strong>Dragon&mdash;the only non-attacking Dragon-type move is Dragon Dance!</strong>
</li>
<li>
Adding together the total Base Power for every move of each type, which type has the highest total Base Power? (If a move has variable power, like Reversal, assume maximum power.)<br />
<strong>It's no surprise that the Normal type wins in this category, given that there are so many Normal-type moves!</strong>
</li>
<li>
Excluding Smeargle and Mew, which Pok&eacute;mon has the largest learnset?<br />
<strong>The winner is Arceus; as of Generation VI, its movepool contains 130 moves (or so I'm told)*!</strong>
</li>
<li>
Name all the Pok&eacute;mon that have had more than one unique ability, though not necessarily at the same time.<br />
<strong>Drifloon and Drifblim both had Unburden in Generation IV before it was cool, and they both currently have Flare Boost, which no other Pok&eacute;mon species has access to. Meanwhile, the Florges evolution line has two unique abilities, Flower Veil and Symbiosis. Kyurem is also <em>technically</em> an answer, since it has both Teravolt and Turboblaze in its Black and White forms, but I won't hold it against you if you considered them separate Pok&eacute;mon.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Which is the only Pok&eacute;mon with a Base Stat Total equal to its National Pok&eacute;dex number?<br />
<strong>Archeops' Base Stat Total and its National Pok&eacute;dex number are both 567.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Which is the only Gen VI Pok&eacute;mon to have 800,000 experience points at Level 100?<br />
<strong>Klefki. And you wondered why there were so many on Battle Spot.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Including Mega formes, which Pok&eacute;mon has the biggest difference between its base Special Attack and base Attack stats?<br />
<strong>Mega Heracross has a difference of 145 between its mighty base 185 Attack and its puny base 40 Special Attack.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Name a move that, between generations, switched from physical to special at least two times.<br />
<strong>Bite switched from Normal-type in Generation I (physical) to Dark-type in Generation II (special), and then once again became a physical move in Generation IV with the physical-special split.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Excluding Mega formes, which is the only Pok&eacute;mon whose name includes all the letters of 'Smogon'?<br />
<strong>Amoonguss! I propose our next logo have Amoonguss, Mega Abomasnow, Koffing, and, since we're going German, Monargoras Tyrantrum!</strong>
</li>
</ol>

<p>*user: The Immortal ran a script using Pokemon Showdown movepools. Don't try to argue.</p>

<p>Of course, we couldn't possibly leave you without anything to think about until next issue. As a parting gift, here are two quick trivia questions!</p>

<ol>
<li>Name a Pok&eacute;mon besides Smeargle capable of having a moveset with 256 PP.</li>
<li>Name a Pok&eacute;mon besides Mew, Smeargle, and Arceus capable of learning at least one damaging move of each type. For the purposes of this question, Hidden Power does not count.</li>
</ol>

<p>As usual, send your answers in a PM to The Smog titled "Issue 35 Trivia". The first person to send in both correct answers wins a custom title; good luck!</p>
