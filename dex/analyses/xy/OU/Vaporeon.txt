Overview
########

The perfect word to describe Vaporeon is outclassed. As a defensive Water-type, it is outclassed by Alomomola, Quagsire, and even Gastrodon in taking on metagame-relevant threats, and the first also as a Wish passer. As a Wish passer and cleric, it is outclassed by Clefable, Sylveon, and Chansey. The issue lies in the fact that Vaporeon's bulk is no longer enough for it to take on top-tier threats, such as Mega Mawile and Aegislash, and Thundurus as well as the newly introduced Mega Venusaur threaten it immensely. If you still want to run Vaporeon despite all this, it is best used as a Wish passer. Water Absorb lets it serve as a decent answer to the likes of Keldeo and Greninja. Scald is a solid STAB move, and Vaporeon has support options to extend its usefulness. All in all, Vaporeon can be used, but is not truly worth considering for a serious OU team.

Wish Support
########
name: Wish Support
move 1: Wish
move 2: Protect
move 3: Scald
move 4: Roar / Toxic / Heal Bell
ability: Water Absorb
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Wish heals either 50% of Vaporeon's health or 232 points of a teammate's HP. Protect ensures that Vaporeon will be healed by its own Wish and can be used to scout opponent's moves. Scald has an incredibly useful 30% chance to burn the opponent and hits decently hard off of Vaporeon's base 110 Special Attack. Roar allows Vaporeon to phaze out potential counters or setup sweepers and chip away at the opponent's health with hazard support. Toxic allows Vaporeon to cripple most walls and cause reliable damage on things it may otherwise not be able to hurt. Heal Bell can be used to provide cleric support while rendering Toxic harmless, but it also makes Vaporeon extreme setup bait if your opponent notices it lacks both Toxic and Roar. Ice Beam provides good coverage with Scald, but isn't particularly powerful without investment and can struggle to deal damage even to Pokemon that are weak to it, such as Tangrowth. Haze allows Vaporeon to act an as emergency check to setup sweepers immune to Roar and is nearly unblockable, but has a tough time finding an open moveslot.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP investment allows Vaporeon to pass the largest Wishes possible, and a Bold nature with maximum Defense is used take hits from physical attackers, complementing Vaporeon's naturally high special bulk. With maximum Defense investment, Vaporeon can comfortably take hits from support Landorus-T and Scizor while threatening back with Scald. Leftovers is an obvious choice for a defensive Pokemon, as it grants Vaporeon a source of passive recovery and allows it to stall more efficiently with Protect.

Usage Tips
========

Vaporeon attracts Toxic like a magnet, so avoiding it through Protect or switching will go a long way in increasing Vaporeon's survivability. The use of repeated Wishes puts your opponent in a situation where they will start trying to predict your passes; pay attention to how your opponent responds after a Wish, because you don't want a Pokemon to faint due to a correct opposing prediction. Before Vaporeon needs to pass Wishes, Scald is the move of choice, as it is able to do decent damage and potentially burn anything that comes in. If Vaporeon is using Toxic, determine whether Toxic poison or burn status would be more detrimental to your opponent's team; this can be loosely determined in the Team Preview. If Vaporeon is running Roar, it's important to keep it healthy, as it has to take a hit in order to Roar an opposing Pokemon out.

Team Options
========

Mega Venusaur resists both of Vaporeon's weaknesses, is immune to Toxic, and greatly appreciates the healing Wish provides since it cannot hold Leftovers. Ferrothorn and Heatran complete an excellent Water / Fire / Grass core, covering for each other's weaknesses and spreading hazards and status. Skarmory is capable of taking most physical attacks aimed at Vaporeon and can lay down hazards or phaze opponents. Support Landorus-T functions similarly with Stealth Rock and can use U-turn to maintain momentum. Excadrill can switch in on predicted Electric-type attacks aimed at Vaporeon and proceed to Rapid Spin any hazards away. Goodra is capable of easily sponging Grass-type and Electric-type special moves, but fears Toxic just as much as Vaporeon does.

Other Options
########

Hidden Power Fire can be used to beat Ferrothorn, but has almost no use outside of that. Similarly, Hidden Power Grass helps Vaporeon combat Gastrodon and Quagsire, though both are vulnerable to Toxic anyway, and 4 SpA Vaporeon can only 2HKO these targets, meaning it will likely be hit with Toxic in return, and it would rather Toxic them. Surf can be used over Scald for the slight power boost, but Vaporeon needs the burn chance much more than the power.

Checks & Counters
########

**Status-immune and resistant Pokemon**: Pokemon with high Special Defense and Natural Cure such as Blissey and Chansey leave Vaporeon unable to do anything and threaten with Toxic. Celebi also falls into this category and can either setup Leech Seed or Giga Drain to recover any health lost. Pokemon with Magic Guard render Vaporeon's Scald burns and Toxic poison attempts useless, and Reuniclus in particular can set up Calm Mind boosts in Vaporeon's face while only being threatened by Roar at the worst. Clefable functions in a similar way and can use boosted Moonblasts to break through Vaporeon after a couple of boosts.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Vaporeon absolutely hates Leech Seed, as its large health total becomes a liability and allows opponents to regain large chunks of HP at once. Ferrothorn is one of the best Vaporeon switch-ins the game, capable of setting up hazards in its face or hitting Vaporeon with the aforementioned Leech Seed. Mega Venusaur is immune to Toxic, only slightly cares about burns, and can hit Vaporeon with either Leech Seed or Giga Drain to recover HP in addition to doing heavy damage. Poison Heal Breloom is only afraid of the uncommon Ice Beam, while Technician Breloom can easily OHKO with Bullet Seed as long as it avoids a burn from Scald.

**Electric-types**: Most Electric-types are frail special attackers and don't particularly care about burn or Toxic. Life Orb Thundurus is strong enough to have a 75% chance to OHKO Vaporeon with Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock damage. While Rotom-W does not do a lot of damage with Volt Switch, it can Toxic Vaporeon or use Volt Switch to gain momentum while taking a pittance from any of Vaporeon's moves. Zapdos also cleanly 2HKOes Vaporeon while the Vaporeon can only manage to Toxic Zapdos in return.

**Setup Sweepers**: If Vaporeon does not run Roar, then Substitute setup sweepers become a massive problem, especially ones that resist Water-type attacks such as Kyurem-B and Gyarados. Lum Berry Dragonite can Dragon Dance on Vaporeon and 2HKO with Outrage, as can Lum Berry Haxorus. Nasty Plot Celebi can tank even super effective Ice Beams easily, Giga Drain to recover huge chunks of its health, and Baton Pass to pass on any boosts it mightaccumulate.
