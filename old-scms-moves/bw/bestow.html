User passes its held item to the target.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user passes its item to one adjacent target, provided that the target is not holding an item and the item being passed is not Mail. This move fails if the target is behind a Substitute. This move cannot pass a Griseous Orb to Giratina, a Drive to Genesect, or a Plate to Arceus.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This move is competitively useless since almost all Pokemon used competitively carry items, and it is usually better to steal their item via Trick or Switcheroo, which work in the same way should no item be carried by the opponent. Clearly this move was designed for doubles, in order to pass more useful items to Pokemon that commonly use consumable items, such as Flying Gem Archeops; however, almost no Pokemon worth using learn this move, and it is almost always better to just give both of your Pokemon an item and tell them to marmalise the opponent than to fool about with your items more than you need to.</p>
