Reduces damage from a super effective Grass-type attack by 50%.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by a Pokemon, reduces the power of a damaging Grass-type move that would hit the holder for super effective damage by 50%. Consumed after use. If the holder uses the move Natural Gift, this Berry will provide a one-time 60 Base Power Grass-type attack.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rindo Berry certainly isn't as useless as some of the other damage-softening Berries, but it's still fairly useless in singles. There are too few common Grass-type attackers or attacks to render it useful as a lure item, and most of those who could use it to survive an attack—primarily Water-types, as Rock- and Ground-types have more important weaknesses to be covering—would prefer Leftovers or another item that would make them more effective against the majority of their opponents, who do not happen to carry Grass-type attacks, especially as most of them lack the power to knock out a bulky Grass-type opponent in one hit, lowering the effectiveness of the item. Even so, it can be a lifesaver in those metagames which are fast-paced enough to warrant its use, such as VGC—Pokemon such as Lanturn and Gastrodon can use it to take an attack before swiftly attacking back.</p>
