Overview
########

Pros:

. 2 great abilities in Guts and Scrappy
. Excellent 85 Base Speed allows it to hit the popular 19 number with a positive speed nature.
. Hits extremely hard when holding a Status Orb to abuse Guts
. High powered STABS in Brave Bird, Facade (when statused) and Boomburst
. Access to U-Turn
. STAB Priority in Quick Attack
. Gen 6 gave Taillow what it needed to stop being a one dimensional Pokémon: Boomburst


Cons

. Horrendous Bulk with paper thin 40 / 30 / 30 Defenses
. Walled by common bulky Rock and Steel types, unless Taillow decides to run an obscure Hidden Power.
. Weakness to Stealth Rock



Guts Sweeper
########
name: Guts Sweeper
move 1: Facade
move 2: Brave Bird
move 3: Quick Attack
move 4: U-Turn / Protect
item: Toxic Orb
ability: Guts
evs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly


Moves
========

. Facade is the main point of this set, becoming a deadly 140 Base Power move with no drawbacks (after you activate your status orb) capable of 2HKO'ing anything that doesn't resist it.
. Brave Bird is an alternative STAB, being significantly stronger than Facade before the respective status orb activates. It should be used with caution, though, due to the unwanted amount of recoil it gives.
. Quick Attack gives Taillow a decent way to hit faster Pokémon, which includes most Choice Scarf users, as well as avoiding deadly Sucker Punches.
. U-turn is a great move to scout and get away from potentially bad situations, keeping your momentum high. On the other hand, Protect grants you a 100% safe way to activate your Orb, but can easily turn against you, providing your opponent a free switch or a sub that can turn the tide of the battle.



Set Details
========

. The listed Ev's allows Taillow to maximize both its attack and speed.
. Since Taillow is a hit-and-run Pokémon and rarely stays in the field for more than 2 turns, Toxic Orb is the prefered status orb.



Usage Tips
========

. Since most of Taillow's sucess depends on Guts, it is essential to activate the status orb as early as possible. The best way of doing so is to bring a relatively slow user of U-Turn or Volt Switch (such as Larvesta or Magnemite) which move after the opponent and are capable of bringing Taillow to the battlefield completely unharmed. Another other way of doing this is to switch Taillow into a Ghost or Ground Type move (or an incoming Toxic/Will-o-wisp), although you must be extremely careful with predictions, as Taillow is incredibly frail and wasn't made to take any unresisted STAB's.



Team Options
========

. This Taillow is prone to switching a lot during the match so Rapid Spin support is essential.
. Speaking of Rapid Spin, Drilbur is an excellent partner as not only it removes the hazards from your field it is also capable of setting Stealth Rock and destroy with a powerful Earthquake most Rock and Steel types that trouble the little bird so much
. Arena Trap Diglett and Trapinch are almost on the same boat.
. Magnet Pull Magnemite/Nosepass can eliminate opposing Steel types
. A solid Pursuit user like Stunky or Houndour is also a good partner to remove Ghost types that are immune to Taillow's main STAB.



Boomburst
########
name: Boomburst
move 1: Boomburst
move 2: U-Turn
move 3: Hidden Power [Fighting]
move 4: Air Slash
ability: Scrappy
item: Choice Specs
evs: 36 HP / 36 Def / 196 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Timid


Moves
========

. Boomburst is clearly the crux of this set. When paired with Scrappy and Choice Specs it becomes a powerful, spammable move.
. Again, U-Turn is there to escape from Steel and Rock types which tend to switch into Taillow
. In the 3rd moveslot, Air Slash is a reliable secondary STAB that hits Fighting, Grass and Bug types slightly harder that Boomburst while having a neat 30% chance of flinching the opponent. On the other hand, HP Fighting is an option to punish the abovementioned Rock and Steels. It must be noted, however, that HP Fighting is a horrible move to be locked into.
. The remaining moveslot is mainly filler. Sleep Talk is probably the most viable option to absorb Sleeping moves.



Set Details
========

. What differentiates this set from the first one is three mainly aspects: Firstly, the ability to lure and 2HKO every Ghost Type in the tier bad Honedge without taking absurd amounts of recoil. Secondly, this set hits hard right off the bat unlike the Guts one. And finally, Taillow's longetivity is significantly increased with no status damage ranking up every turn and also the mentioned lack of Brave Bird recoil.



Usage Tips
=======

. This set performs better once all the Rock/Steel types are weakened enough, so you can spam Boomburst with no worries
. Below are some damage calcs to show Specs Taillow power:


252 SpA Choice Specs Taillow Boomburst vs. 36 HP / 0 SpD Eviolite Misdreavus: 13-16 (56.5 - 69.5%) -- guaranteed 2HKO
252 SpA Choice Specs Taillow Boomburst vs. 116 HP / 236 SpD Eviolite Vullaby: 12-15 (48 - 60%) -- 90.2% chance to 2HKO
252 SpA Choice Specs Taillow Boomburst vs. 236 HP / 76+ SpD Eviolite Porygon: 12-15 (46.1 - 57.6%) -- 51.2% chance to 2HKO
252 SpA Choice Specs Taillow Boomburst vs. 0 HP / 220 SpD Eviolite Honedge: 7-9 (33.3 - 42.8%) -- guaranteed 3HKO
252 SpA Choice Specs Taillow Hidden Power Fighting vs. 0 HP / 196 SpD Eviolite Pawniard: 20-24 (95.2 - 114.2%) -- 6.3% chance to OHKO



Team Options
========

. The exact same Pokémon mentioned in the Guts set also fit in here ,except that there is no need for a Pursuit user.



Other Options
########

. Since Taillow's movepool is extremely shallow, there aren't many other viable options.
. A Choice Scarf set can be used with U-Turn / Brave Bird / Return and Pursuit to outspeed the entire metagame but Taillow is already blazing fast and it receives enormous competition from Rufflet in that role, the latter has access to both Hustle and the coveted Superpower to demolish Rock and Steel types.
. Roost can be used in the Guts set to prolongue the cute birds lifespawn but since almost any neutral move already 2HKO's Taillow, it is somewhat irrelevant. Also, running Roost forces you to either lose precious priority or a scouting move.
. In the Specs set, Hidden Power Grass can be used to OHKO Onix, Omanyte and Tirtouga, Hidden Power Fire 2HKo's Ferroseed and HP Ground OHKO's Magnemite.



Checks and Counters
########

. Unless you are running an obscure Hidden Power, defensive Rock and Steel types are the best counters for Taillow
. That said, Pokémon like Kabuto, Tirtouga, Shieldon, Magnemite and Honedge stand in the front line.
. Since Taillow is incredibly frail, common users of Choice Scarf can easily outspeed and KO the little bird with a powerful STAB, like Chinchou, Cranidos, Archen or Murkrow.
