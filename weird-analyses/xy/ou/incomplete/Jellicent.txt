Overview
########

    Great defensive typing lets it check pokemon such as Ice Punch Lucario, Jirachi, Keldeo, and Scizor.
    Good HP and Special Defense
    Great ability(s)
    Access to reliable recovery and useful utility moves such as Will-o-wisp and Taunt
    Role as a spinblocker is largely downsized due to defog
    Because spinblocking isn't as valuable, Jellicent faces competition from Rotom-W
    Is threatened by common offensive Pokemon such as Thundurus, Aegislash, Mega Charizard X.


Utility
########
name: Utility
move 1: Will-O-Wisp
move 2: Scald / Shadow Ball
move 3: Recover
move 4: Taunt
ability: Water Absorb
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 172 Def / 88 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

    Will-O-Wisp is excellent for crippling physical attackers and getting nice residual damage on things. It also goes well with Jellicent's naturally good special bulk
    Scald is a reliable STAB with a high 30% burn chance. Surf is an option for a power increase, but generally inferior
    Shadow Ball is an option with great neutral coverage if Scald is undesired
    Recover is mandatory for longevity
    Taunt shuts down defensive Pokemon who seek to set up entry hazards or use status moves, and allows Jellicent to often beat these Pokemon 1v1.
    Ice Beam has use to hit Grass-types and Dragons super effectively


Set Details
========

    Given EV spread minimizes Stealth Rock damage and emphasizes physical bulk. Speed EVs are to outrun CB ttar, Belly Drum Azumarill, Defensive Politoed, CB Scizor, and Skarmory.
    Water Absorb is the ability of choice for the Water-type immunity, though Cursed Body can be effective against Pokemon who have only one move to damage Jellicent with, such as Starmie or Lucario.
    Leftovers for handy healing.
    Bold nature for maximum defense investment.


Usage Tips
========

    Use this set to check common Physical attackers such as Azumarill, Scizor, and Excadrill
    Be wary that many of the Pokemon that Jellicent checks can carry moves to severely damage it with. eg Scizor's Knock Off and Azumarill's Play Rough. You should be suitably cautious in these situations.
    Jellicent is prone to being trapped by Pursuit, especially from Tyranitar. As such, if the opponent has a healthy TTar it is often a good idea to expect it to come in and use Will-O-Wisp, especially if you are not running any Speed EVs.
    Use Taunt as much as is wise when you face defensive Pokemon to prevent them from setting up entry hazards, and, importantly, stop them from inflicting status. Be wary against certain opponents, however. Taunting a Ferrothorn to block Spikes or Leech Seed is not always a good option, as Power Whip will deal heavy damage.
    Will-O-Wisp should also be heavily used, especially on expected switches to cripple physical threats and wear down special ones.


Team Options
========

    Jellicent is best used as a pivot or wall on defensive or balanced teams.
    Grass-types are great partners to cover Jellicent's Grass- and Electric-type weaknesses. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn are excellent choices. In return, Jellicent can take Fire- and Ice-type attacks.
    Skarmory and Forretress can lay down entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field, and take Grass-type attacks with ease. Jellicent can switch into Fire-type moves for them. They also can clear entry hazards with Defog and Rapid Spin, which Jellicent appreciates.
    Assault Vest Conkeldurr is a decent partner to check opposing Tyranitar and Thundurus


Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Scald
move 2: Recover
move 3: Will-O-Wisp / Toxic
move 4: Shadow Ball / Ice Beam / Taunt
ability: Water Absorb
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 172 SpD / 88 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========

    Scald is STAB with nice burn chance
    Recover for longevity
    Will-O-Wisp works excellently with Jellicent's high Special Defense and cripples physical attackers
    Toxic is an option for foes that don't fear w-o-w, such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard X
    Shadow Ball is also STAB and has great neutral coverage while hitting Latios, Aegislash, and Gengar super effectively.
    Ice Beam is a decent choice to target Grass- and Dragon-types.
    Taunt works well to cripple defensive Pokemon


Set Details
========

    EVs and Calm nature emphasise special bulk. Speed EVs are to outpace the same as prev. set (TTar, Scizor, BellyJet Azumarill, Skarmory, and Politoed)
    Water Absorb is preferred to provide an immunity, though Cursed Body is viable
    Leftovers for healing


Usage Tips
========

    Use specially defensive Jellicent to check specially-oriented threats such as Keldeo, Manaphy, and Latias
    Be aware that several special attackers carry Psyshock which targets Jellicent's lower special defense. Examples include Latios, Alakazam, and Starmie.
    Remember that because Jellicent has an average Defense stat and this set runs no Defense investment, Jellicent will struggle to be even somewhat effective against physical threats. Staying in to use will-o-wisp against such Pokemon may not always be wise, as they could get off a heavy hit. It is usually best to try and burn such Pokemon as they switch in.
    This set is extremely vulnerable to Pursuit users due to the lack of defensive investment. Will-o-Wisp can remedy this to a certain extent, but be aware that even if you cripple the opposing Pursuit user (usually ttar) it can still do a sizeable amount, which means Jellicent will often fall to the special attackers it is meant to be switching into.


Team Options
========

    Best used on defensive or balanced teams as a special wall.
    Teammates that can handle physical threats are good partners. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn can do this while providing excellent type synergy.
    Defensive Skarmory and Forretress can lay down entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field, and take Grass-type attacks from the likes of Breloom with ease. Jellicent can switch into Fire-type moves for them. They also can clear entry hazards with Defog and Rapid Spin, which Jellicent appreciates.
    Pokemon who can deal with Tyranitar and Bisharp are excellent choices. Conkeldurr and Lucario work well on balanced teams, while Hippowdon is a good choice on defensive teams.

Checks & Counters
########
**Grass-types**: Celebi and Mega Venusaur take little from any move and deal heavy damage in return. Celebi doesn't fear Toxic or Burn thanks to Natural Cure. Breloom can KO with Bullet Seed, though it is ruined by a timely Burn. Ferrothorn easily takes any attack, but hates Scald's burn chance and is crippled by w-o-w.

**Electric-types**: Thundurus and Thundurus-T can smash Jellicent with Thunderbolt, though they don't like switching into a potential burn.

**Dark-Types and Pursuit**: Ttar fears a burn, but can still do significant damage with Pursuit if Jellicent switches; Scarf sets outrun Jellicent and hit hard with Crunch. Bisharp can also use Pursuit, though generally it will OHKO with Knock Off.

**Ghost Types**: Aegislash and Gengar threaten Jellicent with their STAB attacks while not fearing Toxic. They take hefty damage from Shadow Ball, though.

**Substitute users**: Pokemon who can set up a Sub that Jellicent cannot break are good checks. Kyurem-B and Gyarados are good examples here.

**Status**: Toxic in particular ruins Jellicent. Users that can outrun Taunt such as Poison Heal Gliscor, and Heatran.

**Knock Off**: Several Pokemon that Jellicent is called upon to check can deal significant damage and remove Jellicent's leftovers in one stroke. Scizor and Donphan in particular.

**Entry hazards**: Jellicent is vulnerable to all forms of hazards, which wear it down and greatly hinder it from doing its job.
