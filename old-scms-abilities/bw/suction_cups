<h2>Description</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/moves/dragon_tail">Dragon Tail</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/circle_throw">Circle Throw</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/roar">Roar</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/whirlwind">Whirlwind</a>, and <a href="/bw/items/red_card">Red Card</a> cannot make the wielder switch.</p>

<p>When the wielder is first in the party, it is more likely that you will be prompted to enter battle against a wild Pokemon while fishing.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>The only real user is <a href="/bw/pokemon/cradily">Cradily</a>, and while Cradily has a great niche, especially with sandstorm as prevalent as it is, you will not see very much of it, and as such will not be seen very much competitively. It is a nice ability on bulky sweepers though, as it can allow for a successful <a href="/bw/moves/baton_pass">Baton Pass</a> chain.</p>
