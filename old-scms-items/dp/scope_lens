<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises the holder's critical hit rate one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Scope Lens is an interesting item to give to Pokemon with the Sniper or Super Luck ability. Joining these abilities with Scope Lens and a high critical hit ratio move makes a deadly combination that often results in a critical hit. However, it is not seen much in competitive play, mostly because there are better items for a sweeper, most notably Life Orb and Leftovers.</p>
