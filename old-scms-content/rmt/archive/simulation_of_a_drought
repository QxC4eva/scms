<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/38.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Ninetales</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Drought<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 212 SpD / 48 Spe<br />
IVs: 3 Atk / 30 Def / 30 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Sunny Day<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Hidden Power Rock</p>

<p>The Son of Sun, the bringer of light. Ninetales, as glorious as it's made out to be, has one purpose on my team: set up Sun. That's literally it. Anything else it does is a bonus. Out of all the OU Pokemon Game Freak could have given Sun to, I'm very sad their sights were set on Ninetales. It's so frail, has such a limited movepool, and is an overall disappointment. I try to put it to good use with a Specially Defensive set, which lets it switch in on the all-too-common Politoed easily. </p>

<p>Sunny Day: Deters other weather starters from switching in on me. If they do, I make their switch-in pointless with this move.</p>

<p>Will-O-Wisp: Annoys stuff. Especially good to hit opposing weather starters, mostly Tyranitar and Hippowdon so they can't OHKO me.</p>

<p>Flamethrower: Sure, why not? Generic STAB, lets me hit stuff if I need to. Sun + STAB can actually do a decent chunk, and helps with odd things like breaking Hydreigon's Substitute.</p>

<p>Hidden Power [Rock]: This slot used to be Pain Split, then Roar, but I've finally settled on HP Rock for two reasons. First, if I miss Dugtrio's Stone Edge on a Volcarona, I lose. That's it. Second, with this I can pop Heatran's Balloon so Dugtrio can beat it easier. Sometimes I wish I still had Roar, but this does pretty well.</p>

<p>EVs are meant to maximize my specially defensive potential while also allowing me to speed creep stuff like Jirachi, Celebi, and Gliscor. Nothing special here.</p>

<p>IVs are for Hidden Power Rock, and I run 3 Atk so that I still get maximum power from HP Rock, and also so that in the unlikely scenario that I'm confused, I take minimum damage from it.</p>

<p>Calm lowers Attack, which I don't need, and raises SDef, which I desperately need. Makes sense.</p>

<p><strong>Dugtrio</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Arena Trap<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
IVs: 21 HP<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Reversal<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>Dugtrio is part one of my offensive core, and he's absolutely fantastic at the job he's meant to do. He beats up on weather starters and/or Heatran, sets rocks, and dies. That's all. With Base Speed of 120 and decent coverage, plus a fantastic ability in Arena Trap, Dugtrio fits perfectly onto my team.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock: Well, the rest of my team can't learn it, so it makes sense it would be here. Sometimes I don't get the chance to set them up, because Dugtrio has so much it needs to do for the team, but Xatu can sometimes Magic Bounce me some, so it's ok.</p>

<p>Earthquake: OHKOs any Heatran you care to bring, and 2HKOs most Tyranitar. Generic STAB with a purpose.</p>

<p>Reversal: Ah, the magic of Focus Sash + Reversal. At 1 HP, I OHKO Tyranitar, and deal a ton of damage to a lot of other stuff, too. It's nice to have, and a real boon in some situations.</p>

<p>Stone Edge: My team's Volcarona safeguard. I switch in on Quiver Dance and pray that it hits. Also prevents me from being setup fodder for Dragonite.</p>

<p>EVs are standard. Maximize Attack and Speed. No reason to use anything else.</p>

<p>21 HP IVs on Dugtrio gives me 201 HP, enough to live two Seismic Tosses from Chansey/Blissey with 1 HP left, so I can deal out hefty damage with Reversal. Credit to Tobes McGobes for this idea, it works well.</p>

<p>Jolly to outspeed almost everything that's unboosted.</p>

<p><strong>Genesect</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Download<br />
EVs: 92 Atk / 252 SpA / 164 Spe<br />
Hasty Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Flamethrower<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Thunderbolt</p>

<p>The MVP of the team, the best addition to BW2 for Sun teams, and part two of my four-part offensive core. This thing is an incredibly effective revenge killer and offensive pivot. With great base stats, outstanding coverage, Download, and access to U-turn, I couldn't ask any more of this thing (though higher base Speed would be nice).</p>

<p>U-turn: STAB and scouting; basically the bread and butter of any Scarf Genesect. With a Download boost, this actually has potential to do some serious damage. +1 kills off Latios and does work on Tyranitar, two big threats to my team.</p>

<p>Flamethrower: The first move of three-type coverage. Sun + Download can pack quite a punch. Hits Steels and other stuff I need dead.</p>

<p>Ice Beam: Second of the coverage attacks, this lets me revenge-kill +1 Dragonite, who is a royal pain in the ass for my team. Again, it's great coverage, and a timely freeze can spell the end for opponents sometimes.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt: For Water-types and other such things. Just like the other two coverage moves, it gives Genesect rich movepool diversity and allows it to scare off Politoed, among other things.</p>

<p>Credit to Funkasaurus for the spread, I still outspeed +1 Dragonite and get some extra Attack power while I'm at it.</p>

<p>I use Hasty > Naive because sometimes this thing has to tank a Specs Draco Meteor from Latios, and if I run Naive it's a guaranteed 2HKO. Besides, this thing doesn't often take physical hits.</p>

<p><strong>Victini</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Victory Star<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- V-Create<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Fusion Bolt<br />
- Brick Break</p>

<p>The third part of my offensive core, and a mighty beast under the Sun. This thing does not play any games. Base 100 stats all around and a decent movepool plus access to the strongest non-suicidal move in the game makes it quite the team player. Choice Band over Choice Scarf, because Genesect is my revenge killer, and this thing packs noticeably more of a punch with CB.</p>

<p>V-create: Just straight-up smash stuff. With a base power of 180, STAB, and a Sun boost, coming off a Choice Band, the only outcome is utter devastation. Most of the time I'm just spamming this thing.</p>

<p>U-turn: Excellent partnership with V-create. Forces the opponent to choose - do they leave in their Pokemon to get destroyed by V-create, or send in their Heatran so I can U-turn to Dugtrio? Creates massive offensive pressure.</p>

<p>Fusion Bolt: Coverage for when I need it most. OHKOs Scarf Politoed, does more than 60% to defensive Toed, both common switch-ins to an expected V-create.</p>

<p>Brick Break: Often filler, but can OHKO Tyranitar if it lacks a Chople Berry and 2HKO Shed Shell Heatran if it's trolling my Dugtrio.</p>

<p>Again, very standard EVs. Maximize Attack, maximize Speed.</p>

<p>I use an Adamant Nature to ensure an OHKO after rocks on 252 HP Latias, who can give my team some trouble if I let it set up too much. Adamant also lets me get a guaranteed kill on Dragonite after rocks, which my team really needs if Genesect is somehow incapacitated.</p>

<p><strong>Venusaur</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Chlorophyll<br />
EVs: 72 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA / 180 Spe<br />
IVs: 2 Atk / 30 Def / 30 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Growth<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Sludge Bomb</p>

<p>Venusaur is a huge threat under Sun, and BW2 didn't help that any. With new access to Chlorophyll + Giga Drain, it can now abuse the extra power of Life Orb without having to worry about slowly dying to recoil damage. At +2, this beast can tear through basically any team with ease. </p>

<p>Growth: In Sun, essentially functions as Nasty Plot, immediately doubling Venusaur's Special Attack and turning it into a deadly sweeper. Sometimes boosting isn't necessary, but it's nice to have the move, just in case.</p>

<p>Giga Drain: Venusaur's new toy. Only 5 base power less than Energy Ball, with the added benefit of recovering half the damage dealt. Believe it or not, this allows Venusaur to even beat Chansey/Blissey one-on-one.</p>

<p>Hidden Power [Fire]: Beats Steel-types that annoy me otherwise. The list includes SDef Jirachi, Scizor, Ferrothorn, Skarmory...yeah. Generic coverage move, and with the Sun boost it can be very threatening.</p>

<p>Sludge Bomb: My other STAB attack, and also my most powerful one. At +2, capable of taking out basically anything that Giga Drain/HP Fire can't, including Dragonite, Latios, and Salamence, all big threats to the team.</p>

<p>EVs, first and foremost, maximize Special Attack. Enough Speed is put into the spread to outspeed Scarf Latios/Latias, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Defense, to help me live powerful priority attacks such as CB Scizor Bullet Punch and LO Mamoswine Ice Shard, which Venusaur struggles with. Credit to BKC for making me a more efficient EV spread!</p>

<p>IVs are standard for Hidden Power [Fire], and of course I lowered the Attack IV so I take less confusion damage in case that ever happened.</p>

<p>I run Timid Nature to outpace common Scarfers like Terrakion and Latios, which could otherwise stop a sweep cold. Modest is nice power, but it doesn't make sense to me. The point of Chlorophyll is to outspeed stuff, so that's just what I'm going to do.</p>

<p><strong>Xatu</strong> @ Rocky Helmet<br />
Ability: Magic Bounce<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 204 Def / 56 Spe<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Roost<br />
- Heat Wave</p>

<p>The final Pokemon to complete my U-turning offensive core. I needed something to keep hazards off the field, but to an extremely offensive player such as myself, Rapid Spin always seems a little underwhelming. Besides, there's the potential of being spinblocked, which would basically ruin my team. Enter Magic Bounce, the best ability Generation V has to offer. I can reflect all the hazards aimed at my team, and it's wonderful, especially considering the most common SR setter as of right now is Ferrothorn, who my Xatu walks all over. This thing also walls Deoxys-D teams to hell and back, which is nice considering they're still rather prevalent.</p>

<p>U-turn: Tyranitar comes in, I turn out. Works every time. Really, though, U-turn is a great momentum-generating move, and since stuff likes to switch in on Xatu that happens to be easy bait for my Dugtrio, it's the perfect fit on this set.</p>

<p>Toxic: I used to have Psychic in this slot, but it wasn't doing much, so I switched over to this. Toxic lets me force out Chansey/Blissey, annoy Politoed /Hippowdon/Tyranitar, and pull off Roost-stalling on a lot of slower, defensive Pokemon that can't Toxic me back due to Magic Bounce.</p>

<p>• Roost: Obvious recovery is obvious. Combined with Rocky Helmet, I can stall out a lot of physical threats. </p>

<p>Heat Wave: Ah, BW2, you're so good to me. Heat Wave + Sun makes for good fun against the plethora of Steel-types that Xatu loves to switch into, including but not limited to Ferrothorn and Forretress. Not to mention, things like Genesect and Scizor always seem to think it's safe to switch into Xatu. One Heat Wave and they're gone for good. </p>

<p>EVs let me outspeed Adamant Breloom, and the rest are poured into HP and Defense so I can stall out physical threats. I can even live Tyranitar's Crunch easily.</p>

<p>Bold Nature doesn't make me sacrifice any important stat to get a nice Defense boost. U-turn may be slightly weakened, but I don't use it for its power, so that's irrelevant.</p>
