<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Okay, so this is the hail-stall team I've been using for the last two rounds that has worked extremely well for me. Peaking at #1 last round (1456) and peaked at 1412 (forget the ranking) this round, as well as getting two of my alts above 1350 this round too. This is probably the most succesful UU team I've ever made in my opinion lol... The team is built around setting up hail, Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes, whittling down the foe's HP, and the use of SubStalling. However, this team is gettling a little 'old' so I decided to post it and see if anyone had any opinions/changes to make it better. Especially changes to better handle the threats I list at the bottom.â€‹</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/465.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Abomasnow</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Snow Warning<br />
EVs: 192 HP / 60 Def / 52 SpD / 204 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Leech Seed<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Grass Knot</p>

<p>EVs and nature provide Abomasnow with 'magic HP number', bulk, especially some special bulk, and the Speed EVs allow him to outspeed all bulky waters (the fastest being Suicune) provided they don't invest (heavily) into Speed. Also, None of the bulky waters can break his substitutes with Scald, Surf, or Ice Beam provided they have no boosts. The moveset allows me to stall out the foe with Substitute while gaining back HP with Leech Seed. Grass Knot is to hit bulky Water-types who give this team trouble such as Suicune and Milotic, while Blizzard is for a powerful STAB. Abomasnow is my primary check to bulky waters and Electric-type Pokemon like Jolteon and Aura Sphere-less Raikou and of course sets up hail to support Froslass and Walrein.</p>

<p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Poison Point<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Toxic Spikes<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Blizzard</p>

<p>The EVs and nature provide Nidoqueen with as much physical bulk as possible. Nidoqueen is my team's much needed Fighting- and Rock-type resist that would otherwise wipe out this team. She also provides the team with much needed Toxic Spike support which allows me to deal with bulky waters that are an extreme nuisance to this team. Earth Power for STAB and Blizzard to hit Pokemon like Staraptor, Donphan, and Zapdos super effectively. </p>

<p><strong>Hitmontop</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Foresight</p>

<p>EVs and nature provide Hitmontop with as much physical bulk as possible which allows him to spin against threats like Donphan and Rhyperior. Hitmontop is an extremely important part of this team, without him Stealth Rock chips off 25% of 4 other teammates. Close Combat for Steel-types like Empoleon and Registeel who give this team a lot of trouble, especially Empoleon and Foresight guarantees a Rapid Spin. Hitmontop is my check to a lot of physical Pokemon like Flygon, Rhyperior, Cobalion, and Snorlax to name a few.</p>

<p><strong>Walrein</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Ice Body<br />
EVs: 220 HP / 36 Def / 244 SpD / 8 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Protect<br />
- Roar</p>

<p>EVs and nature provide Walrein a leftovers number, as much special bulk as possible, and the 8 Speed EVs are kind of random, I just put them there to outspeed other Walreins... Anyways, Walrein provides the team with much needed special bulk support and is the best Pokemon on this team at stalling the foe out. Substitute and Protect allow Walrein to lose no HP from using Substitute and Roar is for set up Pokemon like Snorlax, Suicune, Kingdra, and to just shuffle through and cause damage to the opponent's team. Walrein can take hits extremely well especilly from the special side which is very needed on this team. She can survive pretty much every special attack out there as long as it isn't STABed and backed up by any boosts (LO Zapdos Thunderbolt fails to KO at full HP, although it does do like 80-90%...)</p>

<p><strong>Victini</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Victory Star<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- V-Create<br />
- Zen Headbutt<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Wild Charge</p>

<p>With a Choice Scarf, Victini basically outspeeds the whole tier provided they don't have base 100 Speed at +1 / Choice Scarf. Victini revenge kills so many threats to this team including Mismagius, Roserade, Raikou, Zapdos, Staraptor, Celebi, Durant, Cobalion, Zoroark, Mew, Froslass, Venomoth, and Heracross just to name a few. OHKOing all of them (provided not heavily invested into bulk.) Victini also provides the team with another Pokemon to combat against Steel-type Pokemon who of course give this team trouble. U-Turn and V-Create are really the only moves I use, U-Turn allows Victini to scout and V-Create just has sheer power behind it Zen Headbutt is reliable Psychic STAB to hit Pokemon like Hitmontop and Heracross. Wild Charge hits bulky waters, but I rarely even use the move anyways.</p>

<p><strong>Froslass</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Snow Cloak<br />
EVs: 224 HP / 108 Def / 176 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Spikes</p>

<p>The EVs and nature give Froslass some bulk, a 'magic HP number', enough Speed to outspeed base 100 Pokemon, and the rest was dumped into Defense. Froslass' Ghost-typing provides the team with a much needed Rapid Spin blocker. Taunt is an extremely valuable move to this team. Not only does it prevent the foe from setting up hazards of their own, but more importanly stops set up SleepTalkers from beating my team. Pokemon like Milotic, Snorlax, and Suicune all wall this team with Rest, however if I have Toxic Spikes up I can Taunt them from resting and keep substituting until they faint or miss. With Substitute and Taunt it also completely walls Chansey and prevents it from Heal Bell / Wish passing. Froslass can easily set up three layers of Spikes with Snow Cloak and Substitute. Blizzard is to hit Pokemon like Celebi and Zapdos.</p>
