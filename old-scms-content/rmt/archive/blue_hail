<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hail is the only permanent weather in RU, which means that if you have Snover, your team will almost always have an advantage. The team originally started out as a BlizzSpam team with Glaceon and Jynx and a core that attempted to cover a lot of the metagame's threats. Since then, I've made so many edits that I can't even remember the teambuilding process. The only two that have stayed on the team since the beginning are Snover and Glaceon. It is obvious as to why Snover remained, but Glaceon has stayed because it is such an effective Choice Scarf user, having the highest Special Attack in RU and the hardest hitting Blizzard. It is better than Rotom-F and Jynx in the sense that it is bulkier and can heal through Ice Body. This doesn't sound like much of a difference, but it actually makes Glaceon a lot more effective than its Ice-type rivals. </p>

<p>In short, the rest of the team consists of a core that covers most of the important metagame threats and is able to wear down Glaceon's checks and counters. Through hail, status, Stealth Rock, and Blizzards / Druddigon's high powered attacks, I can usually wear down the opponents team so that Glaceon can sweep late-game. This team is one of the most successful balance teams I've built since my first RMT, so I'm glad to share it with you all. </p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/464.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Snover</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Snow Warning<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpA<br />
Mild Nature<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Protect<br />
- Ice Shard</p>

<p>Snover not only brings the necessary weather to the team, but it also plays the important role of wearing down opposing Pokemon and providing death fodder so I can take less risks. I never lead with Snover against teams with Cinccino and Escavalier for this reason, as it is valuable beyond providing hail. Snover's Blizzard is surprisingly powerful, and helps to wear down Fire-types such as Typhlosion and Emboar, which I don't really have a solid switch in to. Giga Drain is very useful against Water-types that Glaceon struggles against, such as Lanturn (who Snover walls), Poliwrath, and Walrein. Protect not only allows Snover to scout the opponent's move, but allows hail to do an extra 6% to an opposing Pokemon. Ice Shard also allows Snover to pick off weakened foes such as Galvantula and Accelgor. The damage that Snover can do is much appreciated by the rest of the team. When Snover's job is finally done, I can sacrifice it to get Glaceon in safely. Snover's abilities in RU should not be underestimated and it should not be considered a waste of a teamslot on any hail team. </p>

<p><strong>Glaceon</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Ice Body<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Hidden Power Ground<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Frost Breath</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Glaceon is one of the most powerful and effective Choice Scarf users in the tier. It outspeeds everything unboosted up to Swellow, which is very useful. Barely anything can take Glaceon's Blizzards, and the rest of the team handily takes care of the Pokemon that can. Glaceon can use Hidden Power Ground to weaken Lanturn and revenge kill threats like Kabutops and Fire-types, which it has a very easy time doing since this set [used to be] quite unexpected. Shadow Ball gets good neutral coverage on certain cores, and can wear down weakened Slowking and Cryogonal while getting an occasional Special Defense drop. Frost Breath was one of the last changes I made to the team. I was using Baton Pass to act like a pseudo U-turn, but I never really used it since choosing Blizzard was almost always more beneficial. Frost Breath mainly allows me to beat Calm Mind Spiritomb or Cosmic Power Sigilyph in a pinch if they get a lot of boosts. Glaceon has many opportunities to sweep late-game and this is usually how my games end. If you read further, you will see how the rest of the team helps Glaceon acquire these opportunities. </p>

<p><strong>Druddigon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Rough Skin<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe <br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Fire Punch</p>

<p>Druddigon brings a ton of key resistances to the team, as well as Stealth Rock. Through Stealth Rock, hail, Rough Skin, and Druddigon's powerful attacks, Druddigon does an amazing job at wearing down the opponent's team. I can use it to check troublesome Fire and Water types which usually wall Glaceon. Druddigon is the second best Pokemon for wearing down opposing teams, as almost nothing can switch into its Outrage. I use Fire Punch in the last slot because in the early stages of the team, I was weak to Escavalier. I have no problems dealing with Tangrowth and Steelix, so Flamethrower is unnecessary.</p>

<p><strong>Poliwrath</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Water Absorb<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def<br />
Relaxed Nature<br />
- Circle Throw<br />
- Scald<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>

<p>Poliwrath is one of the best Escavalier counters, and unlike something like Rotom, actually walls a significant portion of the physical attackers in RU. Poliwrath helps against Aggron, Durant, Absol, Kabutops, Entei, and Emboar, who would all be a major threat to this team without Poliwrath. Some of the biggest threats to Glaceon, including Escavalier, Cryogonal, and Entei / Emboar, get beaten by Poliwrath, and will be worn down easily because they very rarely carry a recovery move (except for Cryo) or are weak to Stealth Rock. Poliwrath can rack up damage with Circle Throw or burn things with Scald, two very valuable assets to the team. Poliwrath also has good longevity with Rest and Sleep Talk, allowing him to continuously burn with Scald and phaze with Circle Throw. </p>

<p><strong>Spiritomb</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Foul Play<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk<br />
- Will-o-Wisp</p>

<p>Gallade is one of the biggest threats to hail teams, and Spiritomb is one of the few Pokemon that can beat it. With a specially defensive EV spread, it can beat many special attackers in the tier, most importantly Psychic-types such as SubCM Uxie and Slowking. Spiritomb also provides useful resistances to Fighting and Normal type moves, so the team doesn't have to worry about Bouffalant or Medicham as much. Surprisingly, Spiritomb also helps with wearing down Glaceon's checks. Most people don't expect Foul Play, which does quite a bit to Escavalier, Entei, and Emboar. Will-O-Wisp is very useful in crippling physical attackers like Feraligatr, and it also helps to weaken opposing Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Qwilfish. RestTalk adds longevity to the set, allowing it to stay alive in order to beat Slowking, which is one of the most important Pokemon for this team to take down. Spiritomb can also spinblock against Cryogonal, which helps to put pressure on the opposing team. The most overlooked aspect of Spiritomb is its ability Pressure. This team struggles against fully defensive teams with multiple Glaceon counters. Due to the defensive nature of this team as well, Spiritomb can PP stall opposing Pokemon as a last resort. I've had two battles over 100 turns and a couple of other long ones, and Spiritomb won the battle for me in all of them due to its ability. This is what I usually have to do against Walrein as well. </p>

<p><strong>Cryogonal</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 168 Def / 68 SpD / 24 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Blizzard<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Recover</p>

<p>Surprisingly, my hail team was manhandled by Nidoqueen. Cryogonal was thus added to the team and EV'd to beat it. Cryogonal's biggest use besides checking Nidoqueen is Toxic, which allows me to win more easily against Slowking, Alomomola, and opposing Cryogonal. Glaceon can usually win against these Pokemon if they are poisoned. Cryogonal also provides the invaluable Rapid Spin. If the opponent loses their hazard user and Cryogonal gets rid of Stealth Rock, my team will have a huge advantage in that I will be able to switch around much more freely. </p>
