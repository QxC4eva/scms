Overview
########
Pancham is a Fighting-type panda with access to a very powerful move: Parting Shot, which gives Pancham a niche over the various Fighting-types in the tier such as Mienfoo and Timburr. Thanks to Pancham's low Speed, it can almost always bring in a teammate safely into a Pokemon with lowered offenses to allow room to set up. Another niche that Pancham has lies in its ability Scrappy, which allows it to hit Ghost-type Pokemon with its Fighting-type STAB moves. However, not all is well for it. Pancham lacks access to Drain Punch, or any other healing moves for that matter, meaning it gets worn down very quickly. Pancham also is not as powerful as other Pokemon in the tier such as Croagunk. Even with Parting Shot, Pancham is still fairly outclassed by the other Fighting-types in the tier, as mentioned previously. Despite these flaws, Pancham is still a very viable choice for any Little Cup team!

Moves
========
Circle Throw is a great STAB move, as it forces switches to stop setup sweepers and racks up entry hazard damage. Parting Shot is Pancham's signature move that allows a safe switch-in of a teammate to take advantage of the opponent's lowered offenses. Parting Shot is exceptionally great on Pancham because it is very slow, so it almost always ensures that its teammate will switch in safely. Storm Throw is an overall solid STAB move that always lands a critical hit. Stone Edge hits Ponyta and Larvesta, along with Fire- and Flying-type switch-ins.

Set Details
========
The current EV spread allows Pancham to survive Spritzee's Moonblast, along with having a 6.3% chance survive the to OHKO from Abra's Psychic and itemless Fletchling's Acrobatics. A Sassy nature allows Pancham to have the slowest Parting Shot possible. This EV spread gives Pancham the most special bulk possible while also making it all-around bulky. Scrappy is the preferred ability to be able to force out Ghost-types with Circle Throw.

Usage Tips
========
First off, do not ever use Parting Shot on Pawniard ever, as instead of dropping Pawniard's Attack, Defiant negates the effect and boosts Pawniard's Attack to +3. Pancham is good against setup sweepers to force them out and remove their boosts with Circle Throw; Shell Smash users in particular, as most of them are weak to Circle Throw. Try to always use Parting Shot if possible, as it is Pancham's niche and is what makes it usable, and it's also a very low-risk, high reward move. Using Pancham with setup sweepers of your own is recommended, as Parting Shot gives teammates room to set up.

Team Options
========
Many setup sweepers are great teammates; Pokemon like Tirtouga, Fletchling, Pawniard, and others. Practically all setup sweepers really enjoy having the opponent's offenses lowered to allow room to set up. Spritzee is a nice partner, as it can either reliably set up Calm Mind or keep Pancham alive by passing Wishes to it. Tirtouga is one of the best partners, as it can safely set up Shell Smashes after the opponent has been hit by Parting Shot. It also can safely beat Fletchling.

Other Options
########
Pancham has many different options to choose from, such as a Choice Scarf set, which allows Pancham to reach the magical 21 Speed tier. Iron Fist can be used over Scrappy, as it makes Sky Uppercut a very powerful STAB move. Mold Breaker is another cool option for an ability, as it bypasses Sturdy, allowing Pancham to OHKO Tirtouga. Toxic is a neat option to cripple and wear down walls. Crunch can be used to hit Ghost-types if not running Scrappy or for hitting them super effectively. Swords Dance is usable, but Pancham lacks the bulk and Speed to effectively utilize the move. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge if you're concerned about accuracy, however, you miss out on a lot of power. Bulk Up is another viable option as it patches up Pancham's Defense and bolsters its Attack. Finally, Choice Band is usable as it makes Pancham very powerful and Parting Shot is still spammable on these sets, however, the bulk from Eviolite is greatly missed.

Checks & Counters
########
**Flying-types:** Most Flying-type Pokemon can reliably beat Pancham with their STAB moves. Fletchling in particular is a great counter because Gale Wings ensures that Pancham does not have time to use Parting Shot.

**Psychic-types:** Psychic-types can beat Pancham with their STAB moves; Abra is a great example because it handily OHKOes Pancham with Psychic.

**Status:** Will-O-Wisp cuts Pancham's power and longevity greatly. Toxic also wears down Pancham's health quickly, which is very unappreciated.

**Natu:** Natu has a 4x resistance to Pancham's STAB moves, and if it comes into a Parting Shot, Natu gets a free switch and leaves Pancham at -1 Attack.
