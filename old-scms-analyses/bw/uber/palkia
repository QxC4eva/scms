[Overview]

<p>Palkia is an incredibly dangerous and versatile threat in the Uber tier. Its great Dragon / Water typing and decent special bulk allow it to serve as one of the game's premiere offensive Kyogre counters, while its high base 100 Speed allows it to revenge kill a majority of the metagame's top sweepers, including Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Mewtwo. Between its crushing offensive stats, nearly unresisted STAB typing, and brilliant movepool, it can glue many teams together, and tear just as many apart. Do not expect your team to get far if you lack a solid plan for Palkia.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Palkia's trademark set returns for another round in the treacherous Uber tier. With a Choice Scarf attached it reaches 492 Speed and becomes one of the game's premiere revenge killers, able to reliably take out threats such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza, Haxorus, Darkrai, Latias, Latios, and Flame Charge Reshiram. Palkia can fit into virtually any team lacking a revenge killer, reliable Kyogre switch-in, or just a fast, hard-hitting attacker.</p>

<p>Spacial Rend is your most consistent STAB option, dealing solid damage to anything that doesn't resist it, but Draco Meteor can replace it if your team needs the extra power to OHKO threats such as Darkrai outside of rain, or physically defensive Giratina after Stealth Rock. It should be noted, however, that the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor makes Palkia setup bait for several sweepers that it cannot revenge kill after a boost, such as Rock Polish Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus, so make sure you have these threats well covered if Palkia forgoes Spacial Rend. Surf is Palkia's secondary STAB of choice and is easily the most powerful move on the set under the rain, able to 2HKO even Wobbuffet, who normally scoffs at Choice Scarf users. Thunder is a must for dealing with Kyogre and Tail Glow Manaphy, though it is also Palkia's best option for hurting Lugia, and the 30% paralysis rate can really come in handy. </p>

<p>The last slot depends on what you need Palkia to do; Outrage allows Palkia to be a respectable physical threat and can help in dealing with Calm Mind users and Latias, while Fire Blast lets it take out Steel-types that come in to wall Spacial Rend or Draco Meteor, and also receives a pseudo-STAB boost in the sun. Again, Draco Meteor is an option if you do not need the extra coverage or mixed capability, but often find yourself needing a bit more power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are bog standard; max Speed with a boosting nature lets Palkia at least tie with other Pokemon with base 100 Speed, while the Special Attack investment pumps up Surf and Spacial Rend, the two main draws of the set. The last 4 EVs should go into Attack with a Hasty nature if using Outrage, or into HP with a Timid nature should another special attack suit your needs.</p>

<p>Chansey can take any of Palkia's special attacks in stride and even shrug off an Outrage thanks to the Defense boost from Eviolite, all the while stalling Palkia out with Wish and Toxic. Blissey and Lugia are also in much the same vein, only really fearing Outrage and Thunder, respectively. A supportive Dialga can survive even Draco Meteor and easily OHKO back with Dragon Pulse, though it can not switch in directly. Under the sun, Ho-Oh can take whatever Palkia throws at it and either stall it out with Substitute and Roost or OHKO Palkia with Brave Bird. Ferrothorn can come in on anything bar Fire Blast and set up entry hazards, or annoy Palkia or its switch-in with Leech Seed. Choice Scarf Garchomp and Wobbuffet can revenge Palkia with Outrage and Mirror Coat / Counter, respectively. Scizor, although relatively uncommon, can sponge Spacial Rend and use U-turn to either dent Palkia or gain momentum on the switch.</p>

<p>A support Groudon can scare Blissey, Chansey, and most Steel-types off with STAB Earthquake, while also checking Ho-Oh with Stone Edge; it can also lure in and cripple both Lugia and Wobbuffet with Toxic, and defeat Choice Scarf Garchomp one-on-one. Kyogre sets up rain for Palkia and can also check Ho-Oh, Heatran, Scizor, and Lugia with rain-boosted STAB Surf. Steel-types such as Arceus, Forretress, and Ferrothorn can take Dragon-type attacks for Palkia and support the team. Ferrothorn gets a special mention because it not only synergizes well with Palkia, but can also aid it in taking down Kyogre. Rock Arceus and Tyranitar both resist Ho-Oh's STABs and can OHKO it with Judgment and Stone Edge, respectively.</p>

[SET]
name: Specially Based Mix
move 1: Surf 
move 2: Spacial Rend
move 3: Aqua Tail / Outrage
move 4: Thunder / Fire Blast
item: Lustrous Orb / Haban Berry / Life Orb
nature: Hasty
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Kyogre support, Palkia can be a formidable mixed attacker. In the rain, STAB Surf becomes absurdly powerful, especially when further boosted by Lustrous Orb. Spacial Rend complements Surf well, hitting everything commonly seen bar Ferrothorn for at least neutral damage, and easily 3HKOing any Groudon coming in to remove Palkia's rain. Aqua Tail always 2HKOes Bold 4 HP Eviolite Chansey after Stealth Rock, provided the rain is up, but Outrage is a solid replacement that lessens this Palkia's dependence on weather, and lets it beat Ho-Oh in the sun. Running Thunder in the last slot lets Palkia check Kyogre and pairs well with Aqua Tail, but Fire Blast grants it great sweeping coverage rain or shine, and is generally the better option when using Outrage. So long as Palkia is holding Lustrous Orb, Outrage provides a way of 2HKOing even max HP Kyogre after Stealth Rock, while Fire Blast can deal with common Steel-types such as Forretress and Ferrothorn.</p>

<p>The item choice is key in determining how this set will be used. Lustrous Orb is usually the most consistent option, boosting Palkia's STAB Water- and Dragon-type attacks by 20% with no drawbacks. Haban Berry removes Palkia's lone Dragon-type weakness for a turn, and can quickly turn the tides on would-be revenge killers, including opposing Choice Scarf Palkia, Latias, Latios, and Garchomp, as it keeps their Dragon Claw, Dragon Pulse, and Spacial Rend well out of OHKO range. Lastly, Life Orb boosts all of Palkia's moves—as opposed to just its STAB attacks—by a factor of 1.3, but without the ability to bluff a Choice item or thwart potential revenge killers, the set is better used as a wallbreaker or late-game cleaner.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Again, the EV spread is one Palkia is quite familiar with: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Hasty nature is used to maximize Speed without lowering either offensive stat or compromising Palkia's ability to switch into Water-type attacks from Kyogre. Hydro Pump can replace Surf and the power increase is quite noticeable, but the accuracy can let you down, and Surf usually has enough power to get the job done. Note that Hydro Pump does stand a chance to fell physically defensive Ferrothorn in two hits, provided the rain is up and Palkia is holding at least Lustrous Orb.</p>

<p>Ferrothorn is the bane of this set if Palkia lacks Fire Blast; as Life Orb-boosted Surf in the rain maxes at 36.4% against specially defensive Ferrothorn, nothing else even comes close to 2HKOing Ferrothorn while it stalls Palkia out with Leech Seed or sets up Spikes. Ho-Oh is a decent check in the sun, though it must be wary as Outrage usually 2HKOes. Specially defensive Groudon can be a great check as nothing on the set can 2HKO it without a Life Orb boost, thanks to Drought diminishing the power of Surf and Aqua Tail, while Groudon can retaliate with Dragon Claw or Thunder Wave. Darkrai can come in after a kill and put Palkia to sleep with Dark Void. Variants of Lugia with Light Screen can stall Palkia out with Roost and Toxic, but Thunder will eventually paralyze it, meaning it can no longer Roost off its weakness. Lastly, unless Palkia holds a Haban Berry, faster Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Latias, and Latios, as well as Choice Scarf users such as opposing Palkia, Reshiram, and Zekrom, can freely revenge kill Palkia with their Dragon STAB move of choice.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Kyogre support is a must with this Palkia. Rain-boosted Water-type moves are absolutely the crux of the set and are simply too powerful to pass up on something that can utilize them as well as Palkia can; also, without rain present, Palkia stands no chance at beating max Defense Blissey or Eviolite Chansey. Although a specially defensive Ferrothorn is one of the biggest thorns in Palkia's side, it can also be one of its most valuable partners defensively; it can come in on Lugia and most Groudon with impunity, as well as the plethora of Choice Scarfed-Dragon-types that threaten Palkia, and set up on all of them. It can also aid Palkia in taking down opposing Kyogre, which can help keep Palkia's health high for a sweep later. Scizor, Jirachi, and Forretress also synergize well with Palkia and can build momentum with U-Turn / Volt Switch or support the team with entry hazards, status, Rapid Spin, or Wish.</p>

<p>Haban Berry Palkia is one of the most effective offensive lures in Ubers. It can bluff a Choice Scarf and spam Spacial Rend, then either roast the unsuspecting Steel-type with Fire Blast, or drown them with Surf. After seeing that Palkia is not choice-locked, most players will immediately throw out their Dragon-type revenge killer (Choice Scarf Zekrom, Reshiram, and Palkia, as well as Garchomp, Kingdra in the rain, Latias, and Latios), who will fail to OHKO Palkia through Haban Berry and will promptly be dispatched by Spacial Rend or Outrage. This opens the door for an entire host of threats such as Choice Scarf Kyogre and Dragon Dance Rayquaza to steamroll teams with their main checks out of the way.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Hydro Pump / Surf
move 3: Spacial Rend
move 4: Thunder / Fire Blast
item: Choice Specs
nature: Timid 
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Choice Specs equipped Palkia's Special Attack soars to a massive 598, letting its powerful boosted Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump plow through some of its usual checks. Though Dialga and Reshiram may come to mind first when thinking of Dragon-type candidates for running Choice Specs, it is important to note that Palkia has better STAB attacks to work with than Dialga, lacks Reshiram's Stealth Rock weakness, and possesses much higher Speed than both of them.</p>

<p>Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor is every bit as powerful as it sounds, and not many things can avoid the 2HKO. With Kyogre support STAB Hydro Pump gets a huge boost in power and the type coverage complements Draco Meteor fairly well. Spacial Rend is a must for consistency, and the bite it packs alone can be surprising; specially defensive Groudon, Max HP Kyogre, offensive Ho-Oh, and Wobbuffet are all 2HKOed by it with Stealth Rock damage alone. The last slot depends on what you need Palkia to cover; Thunder maims Kyogre and Lugia, but Fire Blast takes out Steel-types, most notably Ferrothorn. Surf can replace Hydro Pump if you are concerned about accuracy, but the power drop can let you down at times.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Don't be tempted to use a Modest nature! Speed is one of Palkia's most deadly assets and the slight increase in power is nowhere near as useful as the ability to outspeed Rayquaza and tie with other base 100s.</p>

<p>Because of the sheer power this set provides, it can be very difficult to counter. Eviolite Chansey is the closest thing to a safe switch-in, but Hydro Pump in the rain can 2HKO it with Stealth Rock and some prior damage, though the chances are rather slim. Ferrothorn can take anything but Fire Blast or repeated rain-boosted Hydro Pumps and stall Palkia out with Leech Seed and Protect, or just set up Spikes. Lastly, Choice Scarf Dialga, Zekrom, Reshiram, Haxorus, Palkia and Hydreigon, as well Garchomp, Latias, and Latios can all freely revenge kill Palkia with their STAB Dragon-type moves, though none of them can dream of switching in.</p>

<p>Thunder Wave Kyogre makes a great partner due to its tendency to draw in and cripple would-be revenge killers, including the likes of Latios, Choice Scarf Zekrom, and Choice Scarf Palkia, as well as its ability to provide rain support. Bulky Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn can switch into the Dragon-type moves that plague Palkia and either set up hazards or build momentum with U-turn, while Palkia can easily switch on Fire-type moves aimed at either of them thanks to its handy 4x resistance.</p>

move 3: Spacial Rend
move 4: Thunder / Fire Blast / Surf
item: Leftovers / Expert Belt
nature: Hasty
evs: 100 Atk / 156 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Considering the many switches Palkia tends to cause, it has plenty of opportunities to set up a Substitute and proceed to wreak havoc. Chansey and Ferrothorn, Palkia's greatest enemies, are 2HKOed by Focus Punch with the given EVs, while Spacial Rend takes a bite out of nearly everything else. Thunder is generally the best choice for the last slot for the purpose of dealing with Kyogre and Lugia, but both Fire Blast and Surf are viable with the right weather support.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leftovers is the preferred item as the gradual healing helps Palkia recover health lost by using Substitute, but Expert Belt can offset the missing Special Attack investment when using Spacial Rend and the coverage move.</p>

<p>A defensive Groudon is one of the best checks to this Palkia, though repeated Spacial Rends wear it down. If Thunder is not in the last slot then Lugia becomes a problem. Scizor can U-turn to break the Substitute and then go to a counter depending on whether or not you began using Focus Punch. Wobbuffet can revenge kill Palkia with the combination of Encore and Mirror Coat while not caring about Focus Punch at all. Forretress is a pain if the sun is out and you lack Fire Blast, as a 50% accurate Thunder or weakened Surf are not all that threatening to it. Lastly, Ho-Oh walls this Palkia to no end in the sun barring a fair amount of luck with Thunder or repeated critical hits from Spacial Rend.</p>

<p>Palkia's usual favored teammates are still relevant here; Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Scizor can tank Dragon-type attacks aimed at Palkia and either set up entry hazards or build momentum with U-turn, while Palkia can easily absorb Fire-type moves in return. Forretress gets a special mention for being able to remove entry hazards, most notably Toxic Spikes, that severely hamper Palkia's staying power, especially when combined with the health lost from Substitute. Wobbuffet can take out many of the Choice Scarf users that threaten Palkia, and can also use Encore and Safeguard to net Palkia a free turn to set up. A defensive Groudon of your own can use Toxic to hamper walls such as Lugia and opposing Groudon who may stand in your way, as well as set up Stealth Rock which aids in punishing the switches this Palkia tends to force.</p>

[SET]

nature: Hasty
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is another take on mixed Palkia, taking advantage of Palkia's physical options to overcome some of its usual counters. Aqua Tail now snags an assured 2HKO on 4 HP / 252 Def Bold Eviolite Chansey under the rain, as well as max HP Tyranitar in sandstorm, which Surf cannot accomplish. With a physical spread and Lustrous Orb backing it, Outrage will 2HKO even the bulkiest Kyogre, meaning Palkia can still reliably check it. Spacial Rend is still preferred for consistency, but Draco Meteor can be used to blast a hole in walls such as Groudon and Giratina. As a plus, the Special Attack drop is not as bothersome as it is on other sets due to this set's physical gearing. Lastly, Fire Blast takes out Steel-types, while Thunder hurts Kyogre without resorting to Outrage, and is also your best option against Lugia and the rare Flying Arceus.</p>

<p>Lustrous Orb is again the preferred option to boost Palkia's already deadly STAB moves without suffering recoil damage, though Life Orb is an option if you want more power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set retains many of the counters from the previous set, namely defensive Groudon, Lugia, and Ferrothorn, if you lack Fire Blast. Faster Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Latias, Latios, and Choice Scarf users including Dialga, Palkia, Reshiram, and Zekrom can all revenge kill Palkia with their STAB Dragon moves. Ferrothorn can come in on walls such as Lugia and set up Spikes; it also has the bulk to survive repeated Dragon assaults while recovering health with Leech Seed. Kyogre, as usual, is an essential teammate to provide rain support; Kyogre also thrives with Chansey and Blissey removed, which this Palkia specializes in accomplishing.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Palkia can run a Choice Band set, but it is largely outclassed by Garchomp who has higher Attack and Speed. A Bulk Up set with Outrage and Aqua Tail is possible, but Dialga makes a better defensive booster and Garchomp again competes with it in the offensive sweeper role. Palkia has access to Dragon Tail but generally has better things to do. Fire Blast can replace Surf on any set if your team favors sunny weather. If Ho-Oh is a major concern, Power Gem can be used to OHKO it, but it serves little purpose elsewhere; in the same vein, Aura Sphere is always an option to 2HKO Extreme Killer Arceus, but the coverage from the moves listed is better.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Palkia is far too versatile to have a strict counter, as it can almost always beat its checks with the right move. That being said, there are a few Pokemon that typically can take it on. Ferrothorn and Chansey are the biggest thorns in Palkia's side as they can take almost anything it has to offer, though the former must be wary of Fire Blast, and Choice Specs and rain-boosted Hydro Pump can threaten both of them with prior damage and hazards. Under the sun, Ho-Oh can take any of Palkia's special attacks and stall it out with Roost or Recover, though Outrage will certainly dent it. Bulky Steel-types such as Scizor, Jirachi, and Steel Arceus can tank Palkia's Spacial Rend and Outrage, and retaliate with U-turn or status. A specially defensive Groudon serves as a great check to any physically inclined set thanks to Drought. Lugia can be a good switch-in, but hates Thunder and does not like paralysis at all. Choice Scarf Garchomp can revenge kill any Palkia not holding a Haban Berry with Outrage. Non-Choice Scarf Palkia is vulnerable to slower Dragon-types wielding a Choice Scarf, such as Zekrom and Reshiram. Dialga is a shaky check, as Palkia cannot OHKO it without the use of Choice Specs, while Dialga can OHKO back with Draco Meteor. In the rain, Kingdra can outspeed any variant of Palkia and KO it with Outrage or Draco Meteor. As with most Choice users, Wobbuffet can trap and revenge kill Palkia with either Counter or Mirror Coat.</p>
