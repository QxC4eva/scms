Cures confusion. One-time use.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If held by a Pokemon, will automatically cure the confusion status condition when inflicted on the holder. Consumed after use. Can also be used forcibly by the trainer in-game. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Ground-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>This item is generally outclassed by Lum Berry because Lum can cure any status ailment, but it can be used on Dragon-types that make use of the move Outrage if you want to be sure that the user will not be confused after using Outrage. However, Lum offers full status protection one time instead of just confusion protection, so it's generally more advantageous to use Lum over Persim.</p>
