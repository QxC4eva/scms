Overview
########

 Sand Veil lets it dodge Fire Blast and other moves in the sand, which can let it get a free Swords Dance or let it get another attack off.

 Amazing Attacking Stats allows it to go physical or special.

 5 Weaknesses prevent it from taking hits well.

 The lack of Offensive Grass types (outside of Chlorophyll abusers) gives it little competition as a Offensive Grass type.

 Fairly Strong Priority in Sucker Punch (Sadly Not STAB).

 Immunity to powder moves is nice.

 Sand Nerf hurts it and Sand Veil뭩 viability.

 Extremely low speed makes it rely on Sucker Punch a little too much, and can be easily played around.

move 4: Drain Punch

item: Life Orb
evs: 36 HP/236 Att/236 Spe

Moves
========

 Swords Dance lets Cacnea reach a huge attack stat of 38 with EV뭩 and Nature

 Sucker Punch, though not STAB, is Cacnea뭩 only priority and is a must with its pitiful speed.

 Bullet Seed lets Cacnea beat Tirtouga through Sturdy and out damages Seed Bomb with 3-5 hits. It also hurts most walls/SP resist hard at +2, including Mienfoo, Snubbull, and Hippo.

 Drain Punch lets Cacnea beat Pawniard and Houndour on the switch in, which resist the Dark/Grass combo and is Cacnea뭩 best move against Murkrow, which feeds on this set.


Set Details
========

Life Orb helps Cacnea guaranteed the OHKO on Slowpoke with +2 Bullet Seed (2 hits). The EV뭩 help Cacnea OHKO Houndour on the switch and almost guaranteed OHKO on Murkrow with +2 Drain Punch + SR. Sand Veil helps Cacnea be the annoying sweeper it is, avoiding crucial moves that let Cacnea sweep much easier. If sandstorm is not on your team, Water Absorb is the better ability, letting Cacnea get switch-in opportunities.

Usage Tips
========

 Bring Cacnea in on something that can뭪 touch it, such as Slowpoke.

 Swords Dance up.

 Sucker Punch is to be used most of the time, as Cacnea is very slow, making it hard to use any other move.

 Bullet Seed lets Cacnea beat most Fighting types and Dark types.

 Drain Punch hits Dark types much harder and gives Cacnea a form of recovery to take priority and LO damage better.

 Cacnea should be used on offensive or balanced sandstorm teams, as the Water resistance, along with the Sand immunity, is very helpful for teams that need one.

Team Options
========

 Abra is an amazing offensive partner with Cacnea, immune to sandstorm thanks to Magic Guard and the ability to beat both Croagunk and Koffing, 2 pokemon that hard wall Cacnea, while Cacnea beats Lileep and most Dark types with Drain Punch.

 Hippo also get a mention for setting the Rocks that let Cacnea OHKO Murkrow, getting up the sandstorm that activates Sand Veil, and taking hits for Cacnea as well.

 Hippo + Lileep create a sandstorm core that can weaken most teams with hazards, walling abilities, and powerful attacks that let Cacnea sweeps much more easily

 Sand Rush Drilbur is another good offensive sandstorm partner, either Cacnea beating most Water and Grass types opens up a Drilbur sweep, while Drilbur's ability to hit every one of Cacnea's weaknesses SE with QuakeSlide opens up a Cacnea sweep.

 Chinchou is a good teammate, taking most Flying, Ice, and Firre Attacks for Cacnea while Cacnea resists both of its weaknesses. A rather slow Volt Switch also brings Cacnea in unharmed.

 Steel types such as Pawniard and Magnemite are good teammates and each have their advantages, such as Knocking Off Eviolites and slow Volt Switch, respectively. Cacnea also resists Ground, but the Fire weakness is compounded.

 Fire types such as Ponyta can take Fire, Ice, and Bug attacks, absorb burns and hand them out, and hit things hard with Flare Blitz. Cacnea also resists the Ground and Water weakness.

 Finally, since Cacnea appreciates Wish support and a cleric for burns or paralysis, Spritzee is a decent teammate as well.

Other Options
########

 Cacnea learns Nasty Plot, but with no priority is easily revenge killed.

 Seed Bomb is a more reliable STAB, but gets out damaged by Bullet Seed with 3-5 hits.

 Cacnea also learns Switcheroo, letting it do Choice sets decently. It can also get Disable, making Switcheroo + Disable an annoying combination.

 Substitute can help Cacnea eventually get a Sand Veil miss, but it ultimately just wastes sand turns.

 Cacnea also gets access to the new move Fell Stinger, giving it a free Swords Dance when it KOs a pokemon, but Fell Stinger is much too weak to KO most pokemon and, again, Cacnea is too slow to pull it off.

 Cacnea also gets GrassWhistle, putting a counter easily out of commission.... if it had better accuracy.

 Cacnea can actually take advantage of its low speed with Payback, dealing good damage to many things. However, now its bulk prevents it from using it effectively.

 Bulky Cacnea is a decent bulky attacker, with Eviolite letting it take most unSTAB'd attacks such as Staryu Ice Beam and Meditite Ice Punch and kill both of them back. However, without Life Orb, Sucker Punch misses on many KOs.

 Finally, Growth gives Cacnea powered Sucker Punch, alo0ng with STAB recovery in Giga Drain, but Sun is required. 

Checks & Counters
########

 Poison types wall its STAB and Drain Punch, making them effective counters. Especially Croagunk resist all the moves on the set and Koffing can Will-O-Wisp to make Cacnea useless. However, Will-O-Wisp has really shaky accuracy considering Sand Veil.

 Pokemon that can outspeed and take a Sucker Punch do well against Cacnea, including Mienfoo, Scraggy, Pawniard, and Swirlix.

 Flying types that can take a Sucker Punch, such as Murkrow and Vullaby wall Cacnea and kill it easily, despite the fact its suppose to be based off of a Scarecrow.

 Most Dark types, such as Pawniard and Houndour, can easily beat Cacnea, but must watch out for Drain Punch on the switch.

 Cottonee encores Swords Dance or Sucker Punch, takes all hits easily, and can U-Turn to a sweeper.

 Fire types are known as the bane of Grass types, and Cacnea's no different. Larvesta, Ponyta, and Growlithe all deal with Cacnea with bulk, Will-O-Wisp, U-Turn, Intimidate, or combinations.
