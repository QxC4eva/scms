<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Huge Power doubles the wielder's Attack stat.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Huge Power is an absolutely amazing ability. It is the sole reason that <a href="/bw/pokemon/azumarill">Azumarill</a> is usable in any competitive environment, as it takes its normally meager Attack and doubles it to become one of the highest Attack stats in the game. Huge Power will normally be the only ability worth considering on any Pokemon that's lucky enough to get it.</p>
