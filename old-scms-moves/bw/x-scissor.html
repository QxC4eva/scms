<p>Deals damage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>X-Scissor is the third most powerful physical Bug-type move in the game, after Megahorn and Attack Order. Unlike those, though, it has a wide distribution, as a TM move in the 5th Generation. While perhaps less popular than U-turn, it will not force the user out, making it a better option for Pokemon with setup moves, such as Swords Dance. However, do note that Technician Scizor will prefer Bug Bite, as it has a higher Base Power factoring in the Technician boost.</p>
