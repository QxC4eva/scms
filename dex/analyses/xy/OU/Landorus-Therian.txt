Overview
########

With a plethora of strong physical threats roaming around the OU metagame, Landorus-T establishes itself as a solid check to many of the most popular Pokemon in the tier. Landorus-T's massive base 145 Attack is still amongst the highest in the tier, punching holes in opposing teams with its powerful Ground-type STAB attacks. Its ability, Intimidate, is perhaps its greatest asset, giving Landorus-T the ability to switch into many physical attackers and soften their assaults. Its defensive typing is also useful, granting it a key resistance to Fighting-type attacks and key immunities to Electric- and Ground-type attacks, as well as an immunity to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes and neutrality to Stealth Rock. Landorus-T also has access to boosting moves such as Rock Polish and Swords Dance, granting it the ability to sweep or wallbreak.

However, Landorus-T’s Ground / Flying typing results in susceptibility to common Ice- and Water-type attacks, which in turn makes it weak to certain priority moves, namely Ice Shard and Aqua Jet. Its base 91 Speed is fairly mediocre and results in Landorus-T finding it hard to keep pace with common Pokemon in the tier. Landorus-T’s offensive options are both few and unreliable; Earthquake is somewhat predictable and easy to switch into, and its coverage moves either have accuracy issues or are rather situational.

Offensive Pivot
########
name: Offensive Pivot
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Stone Edge / Knock Off
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers / Rocky Helmet
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Landorus-T has access to Stealth Rock, enabling it to set up a key entry hazard for teams in need of support throughout the entire match. Earthquake is Landorus-T's primary STAB option and hits opposing Pokemon hard, even without investment. U-turn gives Landorus-T the ability to work as an effective pivot, scouting potential switch-ins and creating momentum for its teammates. The last move directly correlates to specific checks that need disposing of. Stone Edge allows Landorus-T to be a decent Talonflame and Mega Pinsir check, while hitting Defog users like Zapdos and Mandibuzz hard and threatening common switch-ins such as Charizard and Kyurem-B. Rock Slide is an effective alternative to Stone Edge if you want the improved accuracy, but hits for noticeably less damage than Stone Edge against certain threats. For example, Rock Slide cannot 2HKO physically defensive Togekiss, while Stone Edge comfortably 2HKOes without Stealth Rock. Knock Off is an excellent support move, removing items such as Skarmory's Leftovers, Chansey's Eviolite, and Choice Scarf from some opposing checks, while potentially 2HKOing other would-be checks such as Trevenant, Bronzong, and Gourgeist-S. Hidden Power Ice may seem like an odd choice given Landorus-T's massive Attack stat, but its good base 105 Special Attack allows Hidden Power Ice to hit Gliscor, opposing Landorus and Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite hard. Stone Edge isn't the only Rock-type move Landorus-T can put to good use. Smack Down pressures common Defog users such as Zapdos and Skarmory by making them vulnerable to Earthquake. It also pressures common switch-ins such as Rotom-W. Rock Slide with 64 Attack EVs can also be used, as it retains the OHKO on Mega Pinsir and is generally more powerful than Smack Down. Both moves are more accurate than Stone Edge, but much less powerful.

Set Details
========

When acting as an offensive pivot, Landorus-T needs all the bulk it can receive from EV investment while retaining the capacity to combat certain threats in the metagame. Full investment in HP and Defense with an Impish nature works in conjunction with Intimidate to ensure that Landorus-T has enough bulk to switch into strong physical attackers. 4 EVs in Speed allow Landorus-T to outrun Jolly Azumarill. 96 Speed EVs are an option for outpacing Mega Tyranitar. If one opts for Hidden Power Ice, a Lax nature can be used, allowing Landorus-T to retain physical bulk and Special Attack in exchange for a small Special Defense drop. Leftovers gives Landorus-T its only form of health recovery, something it lacks outside of Wish support. Rocky Helmet is a viable alternative to Leftovers, tacking on extra damage to physical attackers, especially Talonflame, and punishing U-Turn users. It can also bluff a Choice Scarf with it.

Usage Tips
========

As the title suggests, this set gives Landorus-T the ability to be one of the best offensive pivots in the metagame, utilizing its key immunities and resistances in conjunction with Intimidate to switch in on opposing Pokemon and force the opponent to switch to a Landorus-T check, as they risk taking heavy damage or giving Landorus-T an easy opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. As a result of this, Landorus-T creates a domino effect, enabling teammates to switch in right after and eliminate opposing Pokemon that Landorus-T can't handle by itself. U-turn plays a vital role in this, dealing additional damage while giving teammates a free opportunity to switch in with potentially little consequence. The offensive pivot set can be used in all stages of battle effectively, but it finds its greatest use in the early and middle portions of the game, where it can find opportunities to set up Stealth Rock as often as possible and create momentum for its teammates. Once Stealth Rock is up, Landorus-T should focus on utilizing its powerful STAB Earthquake to punch holes in opposing teams or U-turning to scout switch-ins and provide setup opportunities for teammates. Keep an eye out for Landorus-T checks as the game progresses, using Landorus-T's coverage move of choice when an expected check or counter switches in. Removing checks early on could mean all the difference for Landorus-T later on in the match.

Team Options
========

Rotom-W is the perfect partner in crime for this set, resisting both of Landorus-T's weaknesses and using Volt Switch to create an effective VoltTurn core. Rotom-W is also equipped to dispatch most of Landorus-T's checks as well, including opposing Ground / Flying Pokemon and physical walls such as Skarmory and Hippowdon. Similarly, bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Mega Blastoise can switch in on resisted attacks and provide support for Landorus-T and the rest of the team. Wish users such as Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Chansey are very helpful for Landorus-T, granting it another form of recovery as the match progresses. This set forces many switches throughout the duration of a match and chips away at opposing Pokemon with U-turn, so entry hazards support is always a boon. While Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock on its own, Spikes support from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory can greatly help out with racking up damage throughout the match.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Superpower / Knock Off
ability: Intimidate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 140 HP / 156 Atk / 212 Spe
nature: Adamant / Naughty

Moves
========

Earthquake is Landorus-T's strongest attacking option, nailing opposing Pokemon for good damage. Stone Edge compliments Earthquake very well, hitting opposing Flying-types that are immune to Landorus-T's STAB move of choice, forming the well-known EdgeQuake combo. U-turn gives Landorus-T a fast method of both finishing off weakened foes and switching out to favorable match-ups, particularly when faced with unexpected switch-ins. The last move of choice, once again, relies upon which check you wish Landorus-T to combat. Knock Off nails Gourgeist for high damage and hinders potential switch-ins. Hidden Power Ice provides coverage against opponents that resist the EdgeQuake combo, such as Breloom, as well as coverage against Gliscor and Garchomp. Superpower hits checks Ferrothorn and Mega Gyarados a bit harder than other moves, as well as hitting common Air Balloon users such as Heatran and Excadrill. It is especially important for Mega Gyarados, as OHKOing Mega Gyarados with a Dragon Dance boost under its belt can mean the difference between a win and a loss. Explosion is an option in the fourth move slot, as it is considerably stronger than a super effective Stone Edge or neutral Earthquake, so it can get some surprise kills. It also retains momentum quite well, something all Choice Scarf users struggle with. However, using Explosion forfeits a coverage move, and using it when you need Landorus-T for later is a bad idea.

Set Details
========

While base 91 Speed by itself is middling, attaching a Choice Scarf to Landorus-T enables it to play the role of a fearsome revenge killer as well as a powerful cleaner. 212 EVs in Speed allow it to outpace Mega Manectric, an important target. 140 EVs in HP help Landorus-T take hits upon switching in. The rest of the EVs are placed into Attack in order to maximize Landorus-T's damage output. A Naughty nature should be used for sets that include Hidden Power Ice, and an Adamant one for any set with a different coverage move.

Usage Tips
========

Thanks to Intimidate, this set has a fairly easy time switching into most neutral physical attacks, and gets free switches into Electric- and Ground-type attacks, granting it the ability to strike quickly and often. Furthermore, Landorus-T's typing and access to Intimidate grant it the ability to combat some of the most common priority attacks in the game, such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, Lucario's Extreme Speed, and Scizor's Bullet Punch, allowing Landorus-T to differentiate itself from other users of Choice Scarf, which normally struggle against priority users. As with most good Choice Scarf users, Landorus-T plays an effective role as a revenge killer, but thanks to its massive Attack stat and Intimidate, which often forces switches, it is just as well-versed mid-game as it is late-game. The ability to predict switch-ins is vital, as the correct selection of Stone Edge or a another coverage move could quickly spell the end of a check, opening a clean-up opportunity with Earthquake later in the match. A fast U-turn should never be neglected either; backed with Landorus-T's massive Attack, U-turn can quickly knock out weakened foes and allow for a quick switch-in, generating offensive momentum. However, when U-Turn knocks out a foe, it gives the opponent switch advantage. While it might be tempting to abuse a fast and powerful Earthquake or a strong Stone Edge, keep in mind that Choice Scarf locks Landorus-T into one move; Earthquake's predictability and Stone Edge's accuracy issues can be exploited by smart players, so using this set to the best of its ability requires smart decision-making and paying careful attention to the opposing team.

Team Options
========

As this set lacks any form of recovery, the removal of Stealth Rock is a great asset for Landorus-T, allowing it to switch in multiple times without the fear of repeated entry hazard damage. Rapid Spin users such as Starmie and Mega Blastoise pair well with Landorus-T, resisting Water- and Ice-type attacks while drawing in Electric- and Ground-type ones. You can opt to use a Defog user, such as Scizor, Latias, or Latios, but keep in mind that the Choice Scarf set also appreciates entry hazards of its own due to the switches that this set can cause. Wish support from Sylveon or Chansey is also welcome, giving opportunities to switch in as the match progresses.

Double Dance
########
name: Double Dance
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Stone Edge
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers / Earth Plate
evs: 48 HP / 252 Atk / 208 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

With access to two great boosting moves in Rock Polish and Swords Dance, Landorus-T can run an effective set that utilizes both moves, allowing it to deal with a variety of opposing playstyles. Rock Polish doubles Landorus-T's Speed, enabling it to outpace practically every Pokemon in the tier. This is useful against fast offensive teams that could normally outspeed Landorus-T and KO it. Swords Dance, on the other hand, doubles its already massive Attack, making it an effective wallbreaker that can deal with even the bulkiest of checks. Earthquake and Stone Edge provide excellent coverage by themselves, allowing neutral hits on most Pokemon outside of Breloom and Chesnaught. A boosted STAB Earthquake will put a dent in nearly anything, however, and most things that resist or are immune to Earthquake are dispatched handily by Stone Edge. Knock Off can be used instead of Swords Dance, as sometimes, Landorus-T doesn't need a Swords Dance boost to sweep the opposing team, and Knock Off covers key threats such as Gourgeist, Latias, and Latios, that aren't OHKOed by the EdgeQuake combination.

Set Details
========

The primary role of this set is to sweep, so it's mandatory to switch in on something that ensures a boosting opportunity. The choice of which boosting move to use entirely depends on the structure of the opposing team. Use Rock Polish if the opposing team is more offensive, preying on their lack of investment in Defense and upending their normal Speed advantage. Use Swords Dance if the opposing team is more defensive or stall-based, punching massive holes in bulky threats that would normally take Landorus-T's attacks with ease. While scoring a Rock Polish and a Swords Dance at the same time is tempting, Landorus-T often cannot afford the time it takes to set up both. Focusing on one move or the other is often more beneficial than risking taking a massive hit from a check or being phazed out. This set is built for late-game use, gaining an advantage as the last Pokemon standing where it cannot be phazed out by walls like Skarmory and Hippowdon.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support could mean the difference between an OHKO and a 2HKO for this set, so teammates that can set them up reliably are a plus; Ferrothorn and Skarmory are great choices for this role. While double dance Landorus-T seems like a juggernaut, there are certain threats that can switch in and hinder its sweep even after a Rock Polish or Swords Dance boost. Gliscor, Skarmory, Chesnaught, Hippowdon and opposing Landorus and Landorus-T can come in fairly easily and either deal heavy damage or force Landorus-T out. Greninja makes an excellent offensive partner, utilizing its Protean ability to defeat almost all of these physical threats with ease due to their low Special Defense and weaknesses to Water- and Ice-type attacks. Offensive lures are also great pairings with this set, creating offensive synergy while also dealing with specific checks that hinder a sweep. Ice Punch Lucario and Technician Breloom are good examples of lures that draw in particular threats and dispatch of them before they can react.

Other Options
########

With Landorus-T's base 145 Attack stat, a Choice Band set can be very effective, but its low Speed stat and predictability really let it down in the long run. A set using just one of either Rock Polish or Swords Dance can be used similarly to the double booster set, dropping the second boosting move in favor of a coverage move, but a set like this runs into issues against either offensive teams or defensive teams, depending on which boosting move is dropped. Gravity is an interesting and effective support move, turning checks like Skarmory and Zapdos into easy prey. Substitute eases switch-in prediction while also giving Landorus-T some safety against super effective moves, particularly strong priority moves. With the XY sleep mechanics being reverted to the old standard, a Sleep Talk set has gained some viability, giving Landorus-T both reliable recovery and a way to prevent status. However, its unreliable attacking options and lack of a phazing move leave much to be desired compared to other RestTalk users. An Assault Vest can be used to turn Landorus-T into a solid mixed tank with a spread of 248 HP / 56 Atk / 204 SpD with and an Adamant nature. This allows Landorus-T to take some impressive hits, such as +1 Life Orb Modest Volcarona's Fire Blast and Life Orb Thundurus-T's Hidden Power Ice after 2 previous switches into Stealth Rock. With this spread, Landorus-T is also only 4HKOed by Life Orb Gengar's Shadow Ball. This spread also deals with Togekiss, Espeon, Latios, Starmie, and Mega Gardevoir. However, it also loses the recovery of Leftovers and ability to use Stealth Rock to support its team. Soft Sand can be used to give Landorus-T a boost to Earthquake, but it will really miss the passive recovery from Leftovers or the extra damage dealt with Rocky Helmet.

Checks & Counters
#############

**Opposing Flying / Ground Types**: Gliscor and opposing Landorus are among the most common switch-ins to Landorus-T, having the bulk to take most physical attacks thrown at them, and crippling Landorus-T with Toxic and Hidden Power Ice, respectively. However, Landorus-T can use Hidden Power Ice as well to dispatch of these checks quickly.

**Skarmory**: Skarmory is similar to Gliscor and Landorus in that it is immune to Earthquake and has massive physical bulk, yet is without the 4x Ice weakness. Skarmory will eventually fall to boosted Stone Edges, though, as well as Gravity, which allows Landorus-T to deal heavy damage with its powerful STAB Earthquake.

**Rotom-W**: Rotom-W is immune to Earthquake and can either burn Landorus-T or OHKO with Hydro Pump, but it takes decent damage from Landorus-T's coverage moves and also dislikes Gravity.

**Breloom and Chesnaught**: Breloom and Chesnaught are the only relevant Pokemon that resist the EdgeQuake combo, but Breloom is rather frail and is hit hard with Hidden Power Ice or boosted Earthquakes.

**Gourgeist-S and Gourgeist-XL**: Gourgeist-S and Gourgeist-XL resist Earthquake, have access to Will-O-Wisp, and have good overall bulk, but both must be wary of Knock Off.

**Faster Threats**: Base 91 Speed is pretty average, so faster threats such as Greninja and Kyurem-B as well as common Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-W and Keldeo can outspeed Landorus-T and take it out.

**Super Effective Priority Moves**: Landorus-T's typing also leaves it weak to priority attacks such as Ice Shard and Aqua Jet, so Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Azumarill can revenge kill it effectively.
