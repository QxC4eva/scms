[Overview]

<p>In the Spikes-centric metagame that is UU, the ability to set up Spikes as well as to spinblock is invaluable. Froslass's niche is that she can do both. Her amazing Speed allows her to set up many layers of Spikes quickly, while blocking the opponent's setup with Taunt. Her great offensive typing lets her check both offensive threats such as Zapdos and Flygon and defensive threats such as Gligar with a super effective STAB move. However, poor offensive and defensive stats can let Froslass down, and she also has a mediocre defensive typing that leaves her weak to Stealth Rock, as well as Houndoom's and Weavile's Pursuit. In spite of these flaws, Froslass is one of the best Spikes users in the metagame.</p>

<p>Froslass utilizes her blazing base 110 Speed to quickly set many layers of Spikes. Her Ghost typing provides immunities to Fighting- and Normal-type attacks, which in turn allows her opportunities to switch into battle and prevent the opponent from clearing the Spikes with Rapid Spin. Froslass can further use her Speed to Taunt opposing Pokemon, preventing them from laying hazards or boosting their stats. STAB Ice Beam gives Froslass some offensive presence, and allows her to OHKO Gligar, Flygon, and  2HKO Zapdos. Furthermore, it prevents Froslass from being useless when faced with a faster Taunt user, such as Azelf. Shadow Ball can 2HKO Azelf and usually OHKO Chandelure after Stealth Rock damage. Pain Split is Froslass's most reliable form of recovery, and can simultaneously heal Froslass and weaken a Pokemon with more HP. Alternatively, one could again take advantage of Froslass's great Speed by using Destiny Bond when she is at low health, KOing the opposing Pokemon as well.</p>

<p>The EVs maximize Froslass's Speed so she can lay hazards as quickly as possible. The 248 EVs in HP increases her bulk while keeping her HP on a Stealth Rock number. The final 8 EVs in Special Defense ensure that Download Pokemon such as Porygon2 will get a less preferable Attack boost when switching into Froslass. Froslass's ability, Cursed Body, has great synergy with her Ice / Ghost typing. She has several immunities and resistances, and Cursed Body sometimes disables the only move an opponent has to damage her, allowing her to get more Spikes layers. Thunderbolt can be used in the fourth slot to grant Froslass great offensive coverage and lets her deal more damage to Blastoise, a common spinner. However, Froslass cannot even manage to 3HKO Blastoise, so the move doesn't have much merit. The best teammates for Froslass are offensive Pokemon that take advantage of the passive damage dealt by Spikes. Darmanitan, Heracross, Yanmega, and Sharpedo are just a few of the many Pokemon who appreciate Spikes damage. Froslass also likes being paired with a phazer, as forcing the opponent to switch will rack up Spikes damage. Swampert and Empoleon can use Roar to phaze and can set up Stealth Rock to deal even more passive damage.</p>

<p>Even with Team Preview, Froslass can still function well as an effective dedicated lead. Again, Froslass can use her above-average Speed to set many layers of Spikes, giving her team an advantage at the start of the match. Taunt prevents opposing Pokemon from setting up hazards and furthers the advantage of Froslass's team. Destiny Bond allows Froslass to KO an opposing Pokemon when she faints, ensuring both teams have the same number of Pokemon remaining. Ice Beam and Shadow Ball are reliable STAB moves that allow Froslass to deal damage after Spikes are set, or if a faster Pokemon Taunts her.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread maximizes Froslass's Speed and Special Attack. This allows her to lay Spikes quickly and hit a few important Pokemon hard--most notably, it lets her score a 2HKO on specially defensive Xatu as it tries to come in to bounce Spikes. It also achieves an OHKO on offensive Zapdos and Stallbreaker Crobat after Stealth Rock, should she get a chance to hit them with an Ice Beam later in the match. Focus Sash usually allows her to lay two layers of Spikes, and almost always get at least one. Cursed Body can sometimes disable a Pokemon locked into one move with a Choice item and help Froslass get more Spikes layers. Thunder Wave can be used to spread paralysis and further support Froslass's team. Pain Split can be used after her Focus Sash activates to deal a lot of damage to the opposing Pokemon while healing Froslass. Sweepers who can take advantage of the extra Spikes damage are the best teammates for Froslass. Darmanitan, Heracross, Yanmega, and Sharpedo are all good options. Even though Froslass blocks Rapid Spin with her Ghost typing, another spinblocker such as Cofagrigus or Chandelure is a good choice to keep the Spikes in place after Froslass faints. Chandelure and Offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus can also take advantage of Froslass's Spikes layers, using the passive damage to get past potential counters.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Froslass is a very one-dimensional Pokemon and doesn't have too many other options. However, she can try an offensive set. Froslass has great offensive coverage with Thunderbolt beside her STAB Ice Beam and Shadow Ball. A Choice Specs set can even use Trick to cripple a wall. However, Froslass is often let down by her lackluster Special Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Dark-types including Weavile, Bisharp, and Houndoom resist Froslass's STAB attacks and can use Pursuit to ensure Froslass is KOed. Azelf can Taunt Froslass before she sets up Spikes, and takes very little from Ice Beam. Xatu can bounce back Froslass's Spikes, but takes a lot of damage from Ice Beam. Froslass is setup bait for Calm Mind Raikou, but her Taunt ensures it can only get one boost. Cobalion resists both of Froslass's STABs and can OHKO with Iron Head, or even set up Swords Dance if Froslass doesn't use Taunt. Victini, Darmanitan, Arcanine, and Rotom-H can all switch into Froslass with impunity and OHKO with their STAB Fire moves. Blastoise and Hitmontop commonly use Foresight, allowing them to use Rapid Spin despite Froslass's immunities.</p>
