Overview
########

Latios has always been a premier special attacker, something that has not changed with the advent of XY. While Latios struggles to beat some of the newly introduced Fairy-type Pokemon, it still has respectable Special Attack and Speed stats in addition to a wide movepool. Latios also makes for a good offensive user of Defog, allowing it to play more of a team support role, something it has never really been able to do in the past. While the introduction of Fairy-type Pokemon to the metagame has diminished Latios's capabilities as a sweeper, it is still a fearsome threat that should not be taken lightly.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Thunderbolt / Earthquake / Hidden Power Fighting
move 4: Defog / Roost
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Hasty

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is Latios's strongest and hence main STAB attack. Psyshock pairs well with Draco Meteor, getting STAB and good neutral coverage while doing physical damage, hurting special walls such as Blissey. The choice for the third move is entirely dependent on your team, as each coverage option allows Latios to beat a different threat. Earthquake allows Latios to hit Pokemon such as Heatran, Bisharp, and Tyranitar, with the only real drawback being Latios having to use a Hasty nature. Thunderbolt not only offers good neutral coverage, but can be used to hit otherwise troublesome threats such as Azumarill and Togekiss. Hidden Power Fighting is useful for hitting nearly every Pursuit user, as well as targeting otherwise good checks such as Mega Tyranitar. With Hidden Power Fighting, Latios trades its all around good coverage for the ability to hit specific threats.

Surf lets Latios do super effective damage to Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon such as specially defensive Hippowdon and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Fire can also be used for Scizor and Ferrothorn, both of which resist Latios's STABs. Roost allows Latios to heal itself, while Defog allows Latios to support its team better by removing entry hazards from the field.


Set Details
========

The EVs focus on letting Latios deal as much damage as possible while maintaining its crucial Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed threats such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Infernape. A Life Orb is chosen for a similar reason, giving Latios as much damage output as possible without locking its move selections. However, Leftovers is a viable alternative if Defog is used, as Life Orb Latios with no healing lacks longevity.

Usage Tips
========

Latios works best as a hit-and-run attacker, largely due to the Special Attack drops from Draco Meteor. This also makes the best use out of Latios's fairly limited longevity, allowing it to be a relevant force throughout the match. When using Latios, it is important to be careful of using Draco Meteor too much, as many powerful threats can easily set up on a -2 Latios.

Team Options
========

The checks and counters to Latios vary greatly depending on its coverage moves; hence, its partners vary greatly as well. Nevertheless, Sylveon reliably checks all sets. As a result, Pokemon such as Excadrill, Volcarona, and Zapdos make for good partners, as they all threaten Sylveon. Latios pairs well with Pokemon that can lure special walls, making Keldeo a good partner as well.


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Surf / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Trick / Hidden Power Fire
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

This set transforms Latios into an incredibly potent revenge killer, outspeeding nearly every boosting sweeper in the metagame. Draco Meteor is Latios's most powerful attack and the attack often most used when revenging. Psyshock gets good neutral coverage in conjunction with Draco Meteor, taking care of troublesome threats such as Keldeo, Mega Venusaur, and Gengar.  Surf beats Fire-types such as Heatran, Entei, and Talonflame, while Hidden Power Fire beats Scizor and Genesect. Trick allows Latios to cripple walls that it has trouble breaking through. If using Latios in the rain, Thunder can be used to better hit Azumarill, Togekiss, and Mandibuzz.

Set Details
========

As this Latios is a potent revenge killer, the EVs focus on maximizing both Latios's Speed and Special Attack stats so that it can be as fast as possible and hit as hard as possible.

Usage Tips
========

As a revenge killer, Latios should only come out sparingly so as to maximize its longevity. Overuse of Draco Meteor can potentially lead to an opposing threat setting up easily against Latios, so Latios needs to be careful about its choice of moves. Trick should also be used fairly conservatively, as even when using it cripples an opposing wall Latios loses its ability to revenge many popular boosting sweepers.

Team Options
========

This revenge killer greatly appreciates partners with momentum attacks, such as U-turn and Volt Switch, which allow it more opportunities to switch in. Latios struggles to take down Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Togekiss without Tricking away its Choice item, making Zapdos and Rotom-W excellent partners. Given its typing and the fact that it is Choice-locked, Latios lures many Pursuit users. As such, Pokemon such as Mega Lucario, which can set up against the Pursuit users mentioned earlier, also make for excellent partners.

Dual Screen Support
########
name: Dual Screen Support
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Memento
move 4: Draco Meteor / Psychic / Hidden Power Fighting
item: Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

The combination of Light Screen and Reflect significantly decreases the damage dealt by foes, which gives Latios's fellow offensive teammates more opportunities to switch in and potentially set up and sweep. Memento is an equally important component of the set; in exchange for Latios, it lowers the opposing Pokemon's offenses even further, which forces it to either switch out or deal pathetic damage to your chosen sweeper as it sets up. Memento can also be used as a last-ditch effort to cripple offensive foes if Latios becomes disposable in battle or doesn't have time to set up both screens.

The last slot is dedicated to a single attack. Even without any Special Attack investment, Draco Meteor still deals large amounts of damage to frail Pokemon. Draco Meteor also allows Latios to fake an offensive set, which can potentially give Latios more opportunities to set up screens or pull off Memento in the face of greedy foes. Psychic is a more consistent option that checks a fair amount of OU threats such as Mega Venusaur, Terrakion, and Keldeo. While it may seem tempting to use Psyshock to hit special walls such as Sylveon and Blissey, it will not deal significant damage to them without investment, Life Orb, or Choice Specs; Psychic will usually deal more damage against Psyshock's usual targets anyway. Hidden Power Fighting is an extremely specific option that gives Latios a chance to OHKO Bisharp, a threat that is otherwise problematic thanks to Pursuit as well its ability, Defiant, nullifying Memento's Attack drops. It should be noted that combined with Reflect, Hidden Power Fighting makes one of the few Latios sets that can actually beat Bisharp somewhat comfortably. Outside of this, however, it provides horrible coverage and power for a single moveslot.


Set Details
========

252 HP and Speed EVs with a Timid nature make Latios as bulky and fast as possible. The Speed is required so that Latios can set up screens without taking a lot of damage from slower attacks. However, some investment in bulk can be run in order to set up screens more reliably. Notably, maximum HP investment guarantees that Latios can survive Greninja's Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam and have a chance to check it. Light Clay is used to increase the amount of time Reflect and Light Screen stay on the field.

Usage Tips
========

When creating your team, keep in mind the pros and cons of using Latios as your dual screens user. In a nutshell, Latios has access to Memento, decent defensive typing, and relatively higher offense than Azelf. Additionally, Latios's notoriety for being a huge offensive threat can scare off threats and force switches, which definitely comes in handy when setting up screens. On the other hand, Latias has greater bulk and has massive supportive utility with Healing Wish, Klefki has arguably better bulk and typing and can also check threats with its priority Thunder Wave in a pinch, while Azelf has access to Stealth Rock and Taunt, which are enormous positives that Latios does not have.

This set should typically be used early-game to allow Latios's teammates to set up as soon as possible. It can even be used as a lead, though in most cases you should definitely not use Memento right away, as Latios can always come in again and set up screens and/or use Memento. You should also typically use Memento on Defog users to prevent them from removing the screens right away. Exercise caution when using it against teams with Defiant Bisharp and try not to waste it in vain on weak walls such as Chansey and Skarmory.

Team Options
========

This set is designed to be used on hyper offensive teams with multiple setup sweepers, so it doesn't require that much support. However, it has a bad matchup against threats such as Bisharp and Tyranitar, so it should ideally be paired up with offensive Pokemon that can comfortably set up against them. Mega Tyranitar, Mega Pinsir, Landorus, Keldeo, (Mega) Gyarados, and (Mega) Scizor are all Pokemon capable of doing this, as long as your chosen sweeper can avoid being fatally injured by a surprise Ice Beam, Fire Blast, or Rock-type attack from opposing Tyranitar.

Latios may struggle against threats that boost their Speed while it sets up, as this set can't do significant damage against the likes of Volcarona, (Mega) Gyarados, and Dragonite. Talonflame, especially the Swords Dance variant, can check Volcarona in a pinch, and while Dragonite, Gyarados, and Mega Gyarados are a little difficult to manage, either Reflect or Memento can hinder their incoming physical attacks. Simply adding physically defensive Clefable, Mamoswine, or Choice Scarf users to your team should be able to take care of them. Other than the sweepers mentioned above, you can pretty much use anything else, as long as you do not make your team defensively vulnerable to a single threat or type of attack.

Although this set doesn't benefit much from Stealth Rock support by itself, providing it is still very helpful as its typical offensive teammates appreciate the extra pressure, and Latios unfortunately lacks it. It is advised to set them up in advance instead of wasting turns after the screens are set up. Fast and offensive users of this move, such as Garchomp and Focus Sash Terrakion, ensure that Stealth Rock is set up quickly without compromising momentum. Both of the aforementioned Pokemon also have access to Swords Dance, so it is entirely possible to switch them in later and attempt a sweep with screens set up.

Other Options
########

A Calm Mind set is usable, but is generally outclassed by Latias due to Latios's lack of longevity. Similarly, a fully defensive set making use of Defog and Heal Block suffers from Latios's lack of longevity and would be better used by Latias. Latios can also make use of a Dragon Dance set, but due to its innately low Attack stat, such a set is better done by other popular Dragon-types such as Dragonite. Latios can facilitate a teammate's setup with a dual screens + Memento set, but it is fairly outclassed by Deoxys-S in this role.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: If Latios lacks Trick, special walls such as Chansey and Sylveon are able to reliably wall Latios. Fairy-types do exceptionally well, as Latios lacks a reliable way to damage them.

**Offensive Checks**: Latios's checks and counters vary depending on the coverage moves it chooses. Azumarill and Togekiss do well against Latios if it is lacking Thunderbolt, while Scizor does well if Latios lacks Hidden Power Fire.

**Pursuit Users**: Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Mega Scizor make for good counters to Latios, as they can take a hit and prevent Latios from switching out.
