<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. The user recovers half of the HP lost by the target, rounded up. If Big Root is held by the user, the HP recovered is 1.3x normal, rounded half down. If the target has the ability Liquid Ooze, no HP will be restored and the user will take damage equal to the amount it would otherwise have healed instead.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Leech Life should not be used competitively. Its Base Power is far too low to merit use, and there are several stronger Bug-type options available.</p>
