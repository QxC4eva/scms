<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boosts the user's Defense by two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Iron Defense is an excellent move for Baton Pass teams, where it can be used to quickly gain Defense boosts. It is extremely easy to reach +4, or even +6 Defense using this move. Scizor is the best user of this strategy, and is able to pass Attack and Speed boosts as well. For the most part, however, Acid Armor Vaporeon outclasses any Iron Defense user, as Vaporeon can also pass huge Wishes for the team, and has excellent bulk to boot.</p>
