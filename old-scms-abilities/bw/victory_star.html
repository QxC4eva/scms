Increases the accuracy of the wielder and allies on its side of the field by 10%.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increases the accuracy of all moves used by the wielder (and its allies, in multi battles) by 10%. This is a multiplicative increase, not additive, meaning if a move has 50% accuracy before Victory Star, it is brought to 55% (0.5 * 1.1) total accuracy afterward.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/pokemon/victini">Victini</a> will often use lower-accuracy moves, such as <a href="/bw/moves/v-create">V-create</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/fire_blast">Fire Blast</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/overheat">Overheat</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/thunder">Thunder</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/focus_blast">Focus Blast</a>, in order to gain much-needed power, and thus can almost freely use moves that other Pokemon would be hesitant to use. Be warned, however, that even a Victory Star-boosted Focus Blast is still less accurate than an unboosted <a href="/bw/moves/stone_edge">Stone Edge</a> or <a href="/bw/moves/hydro_pump">Hydro Pump</a>. Victini has no other abilities, although in double or triple battles, this can be effective on Pokemon with <a href="/bw/abilities/hustle">Hustle</a>.</p>
