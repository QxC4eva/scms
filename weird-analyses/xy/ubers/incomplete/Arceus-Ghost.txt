Overview
########
Wielding a Spooky Plate, Arceus' spectral incarnation remains a stellar Arceus form and a top-tier threat in Ubers. Steel-type Pokemon now no longer resist Ghost-type moves, increasing the potency of Ghost as an offensive typing and augmenting Ghost Arceus's prowess as both a physically- and a specially-based setup sweeper. Defensively, Ghost Arceus can take advantage of its neutrality to most types and excellent base 120 / 120 / 120 defences to run a viable support set that still retains significant offensive presence, handling Pokemon like Mewtwo with relative ease. With its typing giving it immunities to Normal and Fighting-type moves, in conjunction with the move Will-O-Wisp getting an accuracy raise from 75% to 85%, Ghost Arceus also checks some of Ubers' best physical attackers in Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Kangaskhan, and Extreme Killer Arceus-Normal. In addition, Ghost Arceus can prevent hazard removal through Rapid Spin, a move that has decreased in usage with the Defog buff but is nonetheless still viable in Ubers. Lastly, Ghost Arceus can use its typing to switch out of Shadow Tag unhindered, rendering it incapable of being trapped by another top-tier threat in Mega Gengar. However, Dark-types such as Darkrai and the newly-introduced Yveltal significantly inbihit Ghost Arceus's potential and can easily exploit it to gain momentum. Still, all things considered, it must be reinforced that Ghost Arceus remains a versatile and very threatening Pokemon.

Calm Mind
########
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Judgment
move 3: Recover
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Focus Blast / Thunder
item: Spooky Plate
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Calm Mind boosts Ghost Arceus's Special Attack and Special Defence each by one stage; at +1 Special Attack, Judgment hits most neutral targets very hard, making this set a formidable mid-to-late-game cleaner. Judgment is Ghost Arceus's reliable, powerful STAB move. Recover aids Ghost Arceus in setting up multiple Calm Mind boosts. Will-O-Wisp allows Ghost Arceus to check physical threats like Groudon and Mega-Kangaskhan, even as it sets up. In conjunction with its max HP EVs, Ghost Arceus can also burn Extremekiller Arceus-Normal and switch out to a relevant teammate relatively unscathed. Note that with its respectable natural bulk, possible Calm Mind boosts, and lack of weaknesses to most common offensive types, running Will-O-Wisp can make Ghost Arceus very difficult to break with both Physical and Special attacks, enhancing its ability to accrue multiple boosts (watch out for opposing status inducing moves though - see Usage Tips). Also, with the buff to Ghost typing, forgoing a coverage move becomes much less of an issue. Focus Blast can be run for hitting Arceus-Normal super effectively, and landing a stronger hit on Ferrothorn and Heatran, possibly preventing them from using a status inducing move - or in Heatran's case, Roar; however, its rather high 30% miss chance, along with the fact that Steel-type Pokemon are now neutral to Ghost-type moves, make it a less desirable option. Alternatively, Thunder can be run over Focus Blast as it hits important targets in Kyogre, Yveltal, and Ho-Oh significantly harder, potentially killing them before they can damage you. Keep in mind though that Thunder has similar accuracy to Focus Blast, and that running it means you miss out on running Will-O-Wisp / Focus Blast, which might be more useful for your team. Rain support from Kyogre is recommended if Thunder is run.

Set Details
========
Maximum HP preserves Ghost Arceus's natural bulk, allowing it to comfortably take moderately powerful hits as it sets up, such as from Palkia in neutral weather. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature allows Ghost Arceus to outspeed everything below its speed tier, and Speed tie with other Arceus formes. An alternative spread of 112 Speed with a Timid nature outspeeds everything up to Jolly Garchomp, and maximum Special Attack EVs are run to allow Judgment to hit as hard as possible from the get-go. The remaining 144 EVs are invested in HP in order to let Ghost Arceus take hits a little better as it sets up. A third possible set would be 252 Special Attack / 252 Speed for maximum speed and initial power. This set is more oriented toward posing an immediate threat, while 252 HP / 252 Speed increases Ghost Arceus's ability to take hits while accruing multiple boosts.

Usage Tips
========
If you see weakened threats, pick them off with Judgment. Also, use Judgment to ensure opposing sweepers vulnerable to it, such as Mewtwo, don't set up on you. Basically, don't be hesitant to spam Judgment. Secondly, it is effective to actively make aggressive double switches. If the opponent is likely to switch to their Mewtwo, don't be afraid to double into Ghost Arceus. Ghost Arceus can take most unboosted hits comfortably, so one should not be too worried about the occasional mispredict (again, watch out for status, though).
On the other hand, don't be too eager to set up Calm Mind rashly early-to-mid game. While being gifted with natural bulk, Ghost Arceus is no damage sponge. For example, an unboosted Ghost Arceus might be able to set up a Calm Mind and come out on top of a skirmish with an Adamant-natured Groudon, but it will accomplish this with at most 24% of its HP to spare, leaving it prone to being revenge killed by threats it could otherwise beat, such as Mewtwo or Aegislash running Shadow Sneak. That aside, this set also loathes status, as mentioned above. Burn / Poison limits its longevity greatly, and Paralysis gimps its great speed. This makes it unwise to set up on threats you can ultimately kill but which will cripple you with status in the process, limiting your staying power and sweeping potential. Examples include Ferrothorn and Heatran. Also, be very wary of Yveltal and Darkrai - both are Pokemon that can rapidly snatch momentum away from you. Yveltal can switch into a Judgment and proceed to threaten your team massively with its possible Life Orb-boosted dual STAB moves. While Darkrai is too frail to be switching into Judgment repeatedly, it can take one and threaten to put something to sleep or set up.

Team Options
========
Make sure Dark-types like Yveltal and Darkrai are adequately dealt with. Fairies pair well with Ghost Arceus. Xerneas can take hits directed at it, as well as rid it of status with a bulky cleric set. Other Fairies like Sylveon and Clefable are also viable teammates as they too, provide type synergy and cleric support. However, do note that Fairies are both friend and foe to Ghost Arceus; it is crucial to have a reliable answer to a boosted Geomancy Xerneas at as it can set up alongside and overpower this set. Scizor can use Bullet Punch to pick off Xerneas that have taken prior damage from Judgment. Pokemon like Bronzong and Jirachi can also reliably handle Geomancy Xerneas, but note that these compound the team's Ghost-type weakness. Ho-Oh is problematic for this set as its powerful dual STAB moves outdamage unboosted Ghost Arceus and prevent it from setting up - have teammates that can set up Stealth Rock reliably, such that Ho-Oh loses 50% of its total HP upon each switch-in. Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor are good Stealth Rock setters that can also check Ho-Oh with their physical bulk when the need arises. Note though that both cannot switch into Brave Bird / Sacred Fire repeatedly and the best way to keep Ho-Oh in check is really to make sure Stealth Rock stays up - a Judgment at +1 Special Attack from 0 SpA Ghost Arceus will always kill 248 HP Ho-Oh after it takes Stealth Rock damage and a round of Life Orb recoil. Thirdly, Ghost Arceus is vulnerable to powerful Scarfers after it has gotten a kill - Scarfed Zekrom is a threat that can be dealt with by the aforementioned Landorus-T / Gliscor. Groudon can also be run if its lack of a Ground immunity is not an issue, and if teammates can take advantage of the Sun it provides. Scarfed Kyogre is less of a threat if Ghost Arceus has gotten at least one Calm Mind boost; however a Water Spout at full or near-full hp is nonetheless incredibly threatening - Palkia is a good teammate to handle Kyogre. Finally, it would be pertinent to mention that this set's usage over another Arceus forme should be well-justified. For example: this set checks Mewtwo, so it would be a good addition to teams that are weak to Mewtwo. On the other hand, this set might not be the best addition to teams already vulnerable to opportunistic Dark types like Darkrai. Notably, this set's draws over another Calm Mind Arceus form should be evaluated. For example: if a team were weak to Mega Kangaskhan, running this set over a Calm Mind Arceus-Electric would be a good decision.

Swords Dance
########
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Shadow Force
move 3: Shadow Claw
move 4: Brick Break
item: Spooky Plate
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spd
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Swords Dance instantly doubles Ghost Arceus's attack, skyrocketing its sweeping potential. Augmented by the Ghost buff, Shadow Force hits like a nuke, and at +2 Attack will kill virtually all Pokemon who do not resist or are immune to it, especially after Stealth Rock. Shadow Claw prevents Substitute / Protect users, such as Substitute Ho-Oh, from taking advantage of Shadow Force. With the buff to Ghost-typing, running two Ghost-type moves is very viable - akin to running mono-attacking coverage on the Calm Mind set. Brick Break in the last slot allows Ghost Arceus to hit Normal-types like Chansey and Kangaskhan, that are immune to Ghost Arceus's STAB moves. It also hits Ferrothorn super effectively, and allows Ghost Arceus to come out on top of Extreme Killer Arceus-Normal. Recover can be run as move 3 or move 4, but it is not recommended, as running it in either slot will give you sub-optimal coverage. This set achieves to pull off a quick, brutal sweep late-game, making Recover an inferior option, as opposed to it on Calm Mind Ghost Arceus who aims to stay healthy while possibly accruing multiple boosts. Extreme Speed can be run over Shadow Claw, it hits pretty hard at +2 Attack and can pick off annoying, fast but frail threats like Deoxys-A, Darkrai, and Blaziken, as well as weaknened Scarfers. Note though, that even after a Swords Dance, un-STABed Extreme Speed is still a relatively weak move that does not hit anything super effectively, and is generally outclassed in usefulness by the listed moves. Stone Edge can be run as move 3 to nail Yveltal and Ho-Oh; - notably the physically defensive variant - this is situationally useful and should only be run if one's team dearly needs these Pokemon out of the way.

Set Details
========
Maximum Attack maximises damage output. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature allows Ghost Arceus to at least speed tie with other Arceus formes; this is very important as they can threaten a burn with Will-O-Wisp. An Adamant nature can be run as it achieves certain notable KOs, such as a guaranteed KO after Stealth Rock damage with a boosted Shadow Force against 252 HP / 0 Defence Arceus formes. Note that on teams with Sticky Web support, it is highly advised to use an Adamant nature as it allows Ghost Arceus to become a phenomenal wallbreaker.

Usage Tips
========
Try only to reveal and use this set late-game, after the opponent's Arceus form has been revealed, any Scarfer(s) have been taken down, and the team generally weakened to a level where this set can clean up. One of the main contributing factors to this set's effectiveness is the element of surprise - try not to foil your opportunity. However, if the opponent's Scarfer is likely to stick around, - for example: if he is saving his Kyogre for a late-game sweep - the best course of action would be to sneak Ghost Arceus in whenever opportunities present themselves - either by double switching, or on weaker hits - and spam Shadow Force, or otherwise attempt to do as much damage as possible. Again, be very wary of Dark-types like Yveltal and Darkrai. Don't spam Shadow Force if they are healthy, as they can take a hit and force you to relinquish momentum.

Team Options
========
Make sure Dark types can be reliably handled - again, Fairies make good partners. Secondly, have a plan for Geomancy Xerneas, as with the Calm Mind set. Thirdly, make sure Stealth Rock can be set up, reliably and repeatedly. This is instrumental as Ghost Arceus can achieve many notable KOs at +2 Attack with Stealth Rock up (see Set Details). Sticky Web support is huge for this set - it ensures Scarfers cannot revenge kill it, and provides it a lot more room to maneuver around the opponent. There is a chance that this set will lose to Extreme Killer Arceus-Normal one-on-one, and if so, there needs to be a reliable contingency plan. Support Groudon with Roar can phaze Extreme Killer in a pinch, and can also set up Stealth Rock for the team. On more offensive teams, Ditto is a good option to revenge-kill a boosted Extreme Killer. Also, evaluate the effectiveness of using this over another Arceus set. This set is especially good at heaping immediate offensive pressure on the opponent, and is a good fit on teams that need an opportunistic wallbreaker / sweeper, but the opportunity cost of using it is that you forgo the advantages another Arceus set might provide.

Support
########
move 1: Judgment
move 2: Recover
move 3: Defog
move 4: Will-O-Wisp
item: Spooky Plate
evs: 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 Spd
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Judgment is the obligatory STAB move. Recover ensures Ghost Arceus has staying power and does not get whittled down by attacks. Defog provides team support by wiping hazards from the field, and Will-O-Wisp neuters physical attackers / checks physically based setup sweepers. Notably, Will-O-Wisp, in conjunction with the Def EVs, allow this set to check Extreme Killer Arceus-Normal.

Set Details
========
Max HP EVs and 144 Defence EVs allow Ghost Arceus to better stomach Mewtwo's Psystrike. 112 Speed EVs with a Timid nature outspeeds everything up to Jolly Garchomp.

Usage Tips
========
As with the other threats, try not to let Dark-types like Yveltal and Darkrai switch in on you. Also, avoid switching in on strong special attacks, such as from a Palkia you know has Choice Specs equipped. However, if need be, and users of such attacks have been weakened and are slower than Ghost Arceus, it can switch in, take a hit, and pick off the threat. Thirdly, Ghost typing is much more offensively potent than most other Support Arceus types - take advantage of this by spamming Judgment. If the opponent is switching out his Pokemon, using Judgment twice is in many cases better than using Defog + Judgment, especially when the opponent's hazard setter can set up hazards again with relative ease.

Team Options
========
This section mirrors that of Calm Mind Ghost Arceus, really. One thing to add would be that Support Ghost Arceus is a very reliable defogger - notably, it cannot be trapped by Mega Gengar, so teammates such as Ho-Oh, that benefit greatly from the absence of hazards, are much appreciated.

Other Options
########
An anti-lead set with Magic Coat, Judgment, and Extreme Speed can be used to combat common leads like Deoxys-A / Deoxys-S. Flamethrower or Fire Blast can be run on the Calm Mind, Support, and anti-lead sets to roast Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Scizor. Note though, that with Ghost-type attacks hitting Steel-type Pokemon neutrally this generation, Fire-type coverage has decreased significantly in importance. Stone Edge can be run on the Support set to nail Ho-Oh and hit Yveltal harder, as can Toxic to cripple stallmons, or Thunder Wave to cripple setup sweepers - Ghost Arceus can take most +1-boosted hits and retaliate by crippling it's foe with paralysis.

Checks & Counters
########
**Dark-types**: Most notably, Yveltal and Darkrai, can switch in on Ghost Arceus's STAB Judgment and threaten it hugely with STAB Dark Pulse, or in Darkrai's case, put it to sleep with Dark Void and possibly proceed to set up. Other Dark-type Pokemon like Arceus-Dark and Mandibuzz with Toxic also prevent Ghost Arceus from sweeping, or else limit its longevity with status, as their STAB moves are super effective on Ghost Arceus. Tyranitar is less of a threat as Ghost Arceus commonly carries Will-O-Wisp, but it should not be ignored. Mega Gyarados also deserves a mention as it can harass Swords Dance Ghost Arceus in the interim; regular Gyarados can lower Ghost Arceus's Attack with Intimidate, following which it Mega-evolves to gain a resistance to Ghost-type moves and possibly proceed to set up with Dragon Dance and inflict significant damage before going down.

**Kyogre**: Specially Defensive Kyogre can phaze the CM set; Kyogre in general can deal heavy damage to all sets with its Rain-boosted STAB moves.

**Xerneas** As with Kyogre, Specially Defensive Xerneas can phaze the CM set, or cripple it with moves like Thunder Wave if it chooses to run that. In a one-on-one situation, Geomancy Xerneas can boost and come out on top of all sets.

**Unaware**: The two main users of this ability in Ubers, Clefable and Quagsire, are big thorns in Ghost Arceus's side, as they check the Calm Mind and Swords Dance sets respectively by ignoring any boosts Ghost Arceus might have gained, and wearing it down with Toxic damage coupled with self-recovery.

**Ho-Oh**: Ho-Oh can cripple most sets with its STAB moves, especially under Sun. Sacred Fire's 50% burn rate is also really nasty. If running Substitute, it can really mess around with the Swords Dance set if it does not run both Shadow Force and Shadow Claw.

**Chansey and Blissey**: These blobs counter the Calm Mind and Support sets, by virtue of their enormous Special Defence and access to Toxic.

**Status**: Ghost Arceus loathes status of any sort; Paralysis gimps all its sets, and Burn / Poison limit its longevity greatly, deterring it from spamming Judgment / setting up.

**Scarfers**: The threatening ones are Zekrom and Kyogre, the latter especially if it is at high health. Choice Scarf Genesect with a Attack boost from Download can pose a threat with Iron Head and its 30% flinch rate.

**Kyurem-W** Choice Specs Kyurem-W is very dangerous to Support Ghost Arceus - it threatens to OHKO with Draco Meteor (62.5% chance) after Stealth Rock damage. This is compounded by the fact that it can switch in after Ghost Arceus has used Defog, and has a respectable 125 base HP and 100 base Special Defence with which it can stomach uninvested Judgment rather comfortably.

**Groudon** Physically defensive Groudon checks the Swords Dance set to an extent; it can stomach a Shadow Force even at +2 Attack, and proceed to phaze Ghost Arceus with Roar, undoing its efforts in setting up. Note though that especially with Will-O-Wisp, it is fighting a losing battle against the Calm Mind and support sets.

**Mega Gengar**: Can revenge kill most sets with Shadow Ball. However many boosts they might have attained, Calm Mind / Swords Dance Ghost Arceus is still threatened by Destiny Bond. Note that it can switch out of Shadow Tag though, just that its sweep will be interrupted.

**Priority**: Although Ghost Arceus is immune to priority in Extremespeed, Shadow Sneak from the likes of Giratina and Aegislash can pick it off if it has been significantly weakened. Sucker Punch from the aforementioned Yveltal, Mega Kangaskhan, and even lesser-seen Pokemon like Bisharp can do the same - this is mitigated if Ghost Arceus has Will-O-Wisp, though.
