<p>Alright well the site is up and running once again, and we are just about ready for Round 1. There are some great divisions this year, and I am excited for the chaos and excitement of the qualifying round of the World Cup. Let's get to it! Remember: Fight For Your Country!!</p>

<p>I would like to welcome everyone to the World Cup of Pokémon VI. Signups and team formation have already been completed, and this year the competition appears to be stiffer than ever, with over <strong>500</strong> people registering for the tournament, up from the 430 users who signed up last year. I would like to wish good luck to all teams and I look forward to a great tournament.</p>
