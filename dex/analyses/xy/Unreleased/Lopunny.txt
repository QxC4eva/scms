move 4: Ice Punch / Thunder Punch / Substitute 

Lopunny is back and ready to dish out the pain with its new Mega Evolution. Its newly available High Jump Kick is a staple for the set and is an absolute nuke, especially considering the STAB boost it picks up in the transition. Return is the secondary STAB move that nails Fighting-resistant Pokemon. Healing Wish is invaluable for bulky offense and balance teams, as it gives a teammate a chance to come back out swinging after Mega Lopunny's usefulness has expired. Ice Punch hits Gliscor/Gligar as well as Dragon-types hard, Thunder Punch handles Gyarados, and Substitute can be used to avoid status moves or take advantage of an opponent's switch. The absolute best part of Mega Lopunny's offensive prowess is the addition of the Scrappy ability, which allows it to spam High Jump Kick freely regardless of any Ghost-types the opponent may have.
