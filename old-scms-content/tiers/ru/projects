<h2>Projects</h2>

<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?p=4420876">The RU Forum Ladder</a></strong> is a tournament-like project that promotes competition. In it, RU players will be ranked from Rank 1 to Rank 5. Each player has the opportunity to move up a rank based on how much they win. This is a great way to prove your skill and get involved in the community!</p>
<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3471289">Project RarelyUsed</a></strong> is a project to come up with and test creative movesets, standard movesets with a twist, and underrated movesets and Pokemon. The Set Database includes these sets and Pokemon that have been tested and are viable in the tier.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3471259">RU Teambuilding</a></strong> is a project designed to help new players build teams by finding good Pokemon to fit the roles that their team needs. Experienced RU players post good, standard sets for Pokemon and explain why they work, which Pokemon they work well with, and what counters that set. In addition, it also helps show new players what isn't very good. Each set is organized in the first post by its role so players can easily find a Pokemon that suits their team's needs.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3473198">Research Week (#12)</a></strong> is a project that looks at underrated Pokemon. Every 1-2 weeks, four Pokemon are designated to be researched, and players can discuss and post sets that they think are good or creative. Players who do well on the ladder with these Pokemon or make sets that complete one of the challenges in the first post will receive prizes. The current research week Pokemon are Stoutland, Misdreavus, Swanna, and Basculin.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3469588">RU Pokemon of the Week (#14)</a></strong> is a project that picks one RU Pokemon each week to study.

<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3472160">The Rarely-Rarely Used Contest</a></strong> aims to increase discussion and use of those Pokemon that fall below 3% usage in the monthly stats. Players pick two or more lesser used threats to build a team around and ladder with, and a hall of fame will be kept for those that find success!</p>
<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3473183">It Will Rain - RU Collaboration Challenge</a></strong> is a project with multiple goals: to publish a guide to rain offense on-site, to promote discussion on the Rain Dance strategy, and to experiment with various strategies by completing ladder challenges using rain teams.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3473124">The RU Viability Ranking Thread</a></strong> is a project to discuss how viable, or usable, each relevant Pokemon in the metagame is. Each Pokemon will be put into one of five ranks which will tell how good the Pokemon is in RU. The ranks of each Pokemon are discussed by <strong>you</strong>, so if you think a Pokemon's rank should be changed or if a certain Pokemon should be added to the list, feel free to post your thoughts!</p>
