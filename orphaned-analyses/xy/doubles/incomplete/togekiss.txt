**Offensive Type Advantage**:
Steel-types such as Heatran, Mawile, Jirachi, Bisharp, Excadrill, Aegislash, Scizor, and Genesect
Electric-types such as the Thundurus formes, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Rotom-C, and Manectric
Ice-types such as Cloyster and the Kyurem formes
Mega Gengar
**Miscellaneous**
Spread moves can make its support useless, if not downright counterproductive
**Utility Moves**
Taunt shuts down supportive variants while encore can be pretty annoying
