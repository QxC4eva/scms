[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of -4. Base Power doubles if the user was hit with an attack that would deal damage to it, even if zero damage was dealt after the attack hits, this turn other than Pain Split.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Revenge is very rarely used, mostly because of the existence of Close Combat, Brick Break, and Hi Jump Kick, which are at least as powerful as Revenge. The negative priority and the necessity of moving second prevent this move from being very helpful for most Pokemon. However, a slow Fighting type using Bulk Up, such as Hitmontop, can use it to avoid the Defense drops of Close Combat and the possible crash damage of Hi Jump Kick.</p>
