Monthly Art Contest #22: Minimalism
[head]

[page]

<p>Oftentimes, dedicated artists will pour hours into their work to get down all the right details. From lines to shading and everything in between, an attention to minute details is what makes an artist great. However, artists who can convey a lot in their art pieces with very subtle nuances and few features also have their own merit. That's where the minimalism theme in this Monthly Art Contest comes in. After all, less is more, right?</p>
