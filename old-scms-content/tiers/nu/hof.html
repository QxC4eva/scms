<h2>NeverUsed Premier League II</h2>
<p>Winner: <strong>FLCL</strong> and the <strong>Viritolic Vileplumes!</strong></p>

<p>NeverUsed Smogon Premier League II is a smaller SPL, hosted on the NU forums. NUPL draws out some of the most competent NU players from every generation, as NUPL II featured XY, BW, and DPP as playable formats. FLCL and the Vileplumes, after losing to the Ainsleys in Week 5, came back to beat them in the finals, taking on the honor of being the winners of the second installment of NUPL.</p>
