<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder uses a damage-dealing Ice-type move, then the holder consumes this item and the power of that move is increased by 50%. One-time use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>In single battles, Ice Gem is not typically a useful item, unfortunately. While the one-time boost to Ice-type attacks is nice, most Pokemon using Ice-type attacks would rather have the more reliable power of Life Orb or Choice items.</p>

<p>Typically Gems are more valuable in the VGC and similar environments, and Ice Gem is often used here to boost the power of Ice-type attacks such as Icicle Crash from Pokemon such as Mamoswine. The one-time power boost can come in very useful in such a fast-paced metagame, especially as it comes without any drawbacks. In addition, it can be of great use to hail-based offensive teams, in order to boost the power of Blizzard from Pokemon such as Rotom-F, Froslass, and Lapras.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Occur randomly in Dust Clouds.</p>
