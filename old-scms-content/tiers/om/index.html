<h2>Introduction to the Other Metagames Hub</h2>

<div class="intro">Welcome to the Other Metagames hub! This hub is a bit different from the rest of the tier hubs that you may be familiar with; each metagame that gets sufficient popularity will have its own page. In these pages, anything regarding the tier can go there, such as mini threat lists, projects, articles, and more. This is the place to be if you're interested in all of the wacky metagames Smogon has to offer. If you want to talk about the different other metagames, join us on the forums or on IRC on #othermetas. We also have a room on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown!, which you can find <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/othermetas">here</a>! If you aren't used to IRC and you want to join us at #othermetas, find out more about IRC <a href="/irc/">here</a>.</div>

            <p><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" style="float:left; margin-right:15px;" /><a href="/forums/threads/.3521887/">Classic Hackmons</a> wins OMotM for Ferbruary! After coming in second for OMotM January, Classic Hackmons takes the win with an astounding 46 votes. In this metagame, all Pok&eacute;mon can have any ability, any move, and as many as 252 EVs in every single stat. Furthermore, Pok&eacute;mon are able to be used without their Mega Stones / Orbs in their Mega / Primal formes, and you can use more than one! There are no clauses in this metagame, and there are no bans whatsoever. This metagame comes from hacking in-game and has since gained a very popular community. This great community is what pushed Classic Hackmons into victory this month! This metagame is able to be played on the <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/">main Pok&eacute;mon Showdown!</a> server, and be sure to come by the <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/othermetas">Other Metagames room</a> to discuss Classic Hackmons!

            <p><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" style="float:left; margin-right:15px;" /><a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/oras-fu-winner-of-omotm.3519286/">FU</a>, a tier below PU, has been elected as OMotM! FU, like PU, does not stand for anything. (that you know of!) There's been a bit of confusion, but this discussion takes place in the OM room, not the PU room, contrary to popular belief. Anyways, this tier is full of a variety of new and wonderful surprises and is now able to be played on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! now!</p>

<p>In other news, Eevee General and The Immortal have been elected as new OM leaders! Hollywood, our previous OM leader, has stepped down in this position and has given it to Eevee and Immortal, two dedicated and fantastic mods. Congratulations to both of them!</p>

            <p><img src="/competitor/articles/interview_unf.png" alt="unfixable" style="float:left; margin-right:15px;" />With ORAS right around the corner, one can expect to see a lot of new ideas and creative metagames popping up. In order to get us hyped for ORAS, we've began hosting some new projects! Firstly, the <a href="/forums/threads/.3491902/">Seasonal Ladder</a> is back up and running by popular demand! Joim is back to the website and has recently added this to the main server. Next, the Community Create a Team thread is back up and can be found <a href="/forums/threads/.3521773/">here</a>. This time around is PU and the thread is currently in nomination stage; why not go post some sets? Next, I'm bringing us some ladder challenges with the <a href="/forums/threads/.3520835/">spice up your life challenge</a>, bringing you creative ways to have fun on the ladder and earn points! Finally, in preperation for ORAS, a general ORAS OM discussion thread has been opened up; check it out <a href="/forums/threads/.3519986/">here</a>! That's all for today, but I'll be sure to update this with ORAS news when it comes!</p>

The ladder should be up on <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/">Pok&eacute;mon Showdown!</a> shortly, but until then feel free to come by the <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/othermetas">Other Metagames room</a> to discuss it! This is a metagame in which all Pokemon with stats under 350 are doubled, Ubers are also allowed. Pawniard and Spritzee are also banned.</p>

    <div class="news"> 
        <div>
            <p><img src="/smog/issue33/jap_treecko.png" alt="Hollywood" style="float:left; margin-right:15px;" />Untouched nearly since its inception in BW, the OM Hub is in need of some major reworking, which The Eevee General and I are currently doing! Over the next week or so, we hope to have the hub up and running with completely up-to-date indexes, information, and metagames.</p>

<p>Once we finish with these updates, we'll be looking for help writing articles and other various pieces for the hub. There will be more information available when this time comes, so keep a lookout in the OM subforum for ways you can help out!</p>

    <div class="title"><p>Hollywood is leader!</p></div>
    <div class="news"> 
        <div>
            <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3PTvn0A.png" alt="Eevee General" style="float:left; margin-right:15px;" /> Arcticblast's leadership has officially ended, though his presence won't be forgotten. He led Other Metagames during a time of huge growth: from a secluded section of the forums to a burgeoning area filled with many new, popular metagames. He will be missed, but you might still see him from time to time, visiting the part of the site that he once cultivated before he passed it on to its next leader.</p>

<p>Hollywood was already a well-known mod in Other Metagames and across the Smogon forums before taking over. He was running a few metagames and contributing to the development of many more through the submissions process--who better else than him for the new leadership position? It's Hollywood's position and influence in other parts of the site that will take Other Metagames to the next level. Expect more inclusion with other site projects and a stronger image presented for players who normally wouldn't think twice about visiting our threads. We're paving ahead, so come along for the ride!</p>
