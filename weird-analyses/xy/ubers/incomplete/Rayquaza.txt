########

- Its base 150 Attack and base 150 Special Attack give it immediate power and make it an excellent mixed attacker
- Excellent boosting moves in Swords Dance and Dragon Dance, which augment its sweeping capabilities
- Handful of devastating moves in its arsenal, including Draco Meteor and V-Create, as well as access to powerful priority in the form of Extreme Speed, though some were nerfed in the shift to XY
- 105/90/90 defensive stats are fairly poor, and the lack of bulk is compounded by a weakness to Stealth Rock (it's immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes though!), though this is manageable due to the Defog buff
- Average base 95 Speed means it can be revenged by a handful of Choice Scarf users even after a boost
- Outrage is no longer spammable, and can even make Rayquaza a liability at times due to Fairy-types
- Rise of bulky support Arceus with Will-O-Wisp hurts Rayquaza, and Xerneas makes Rayquaza sad
- Air Lock not longer as important due to weather nerf, and by extension, decrease in popularity of Excadrill, Omastar, Kabutops, and other weather-reliant sweepers, though prevents Steel-types from walling Rayquaza in rain


Swords Dance

########

Name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Extreme Speed
move 4: V-Create
ability: Air Lock
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves

========

- Swords Dance brings Rayquaza’s attack to 798 with a Jolly nature and 876 with an Adamant one, giving it incredible wallbreaking prowess
- Dragon Claw is a reliable STAB move that deals heavy damage when boosted, though max HP Arceus avoids the OHKO even with Stealth Rock in place
- Extreme Speed is a solid utility move, as priority allows Rayquaza to dent faster Pokemon that can KO Rayquaza such as Palkia and Timid Kyurem-W and has a chance to KO frailer Pokemon such as Darkrai and Mewtwo at +2
- V-Create is Rayquaza's way of dealing with Steel-types such as Skarmory and Steel Arceus and neutral Arceus formes, and a boosted V-Create will take a hefty chunk out of Fairy-types that attempt to come in on Dragon Claw (V-Create is generally an acceptable move to throw out)
+2 252+ Atk Life Orb Rayquaza V-create vs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Xerneas: 463-545 (101.5 - 119.5%)

Set Details

========

- Maximum Attack with an Adamant nature bestows upon Rayquaza excellent wallbreaking power, and maximum investment in Speed allows it to outrun slower walls, minimally invested / uninvested base 90s, etc.
- A Jolly nature can be run to speed tie with Kyurem forms and opposing Rayquaza, as well as outspeed max Speed base 90s but this comes at the cost of power
- Life Orb is used for the boost in power
- Earthquake can be run over V-Create, as the set is easily checked and phazed out by Heatran, but Rayquaza will sorely miss the power of V-Create
- Outrage can be run over Dragon Claw for the extra power, though Dragon Claw is usually enough, but will give Fairy-types a free turn if not used carefully

Usage Tips

========

- Stealth Rock support is almost mandatory to ensure KOs with Extreme Speed, as well as break the occasional Sturdy or Focus Sash
- This Rayquaza set focuses on acting as a wallbreaker, ripping through Chansey, Giratina, and other bulkier walls that the team may struggle against

Team Options

========

- Reliable entry hazard users are wonderful partners to Rayquaza, as Rayquaza can easily force switches and capitalize on residual damage to ensure KOs
- Rapid Spin support is very much appreciated, as poor bulk, Life Orb recoil, and residual damage from Stealth Rock will lead quickly to a KO'd Rayquaza
- Faster Fairy-types are excellent teammates, as they can deal with faster Dragon-types such as Palkia that Rayquaza fails against one-on-one
- Steel-types such as Aegislash and Steel Arceus are great teammates for Rayquaza, as they resist Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon moves-, and a STAB move can heavily damage the Fairy-types that Rayquaza hates
- Pokemon such as Zekrom and Kyurem-W that can deal with Lugia are appreciated, as it can phaze Rayquaza out while not taking too much damage if Multiscale is intact
- If not running Earthquake, Ground- and Fighting-types that can deal with Heatran are helpful too


Mixed Attacker

########

name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Fire Blast / Earthquake
move 4: Extreme Speed
ability: Air Lock
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty / Naive

Moves

========

-Draco Meteor hits Groudon and Lugia much harder than Dragon Claw
-Dragon Claw is your more reliable than the alternative
-Fire Blast hits Steel types like Steel Arceus and other Steel types
-ExtremeSpeed can KO any Pokemon that are at low health
-Earthquake can also be used if you want to lure in Heatran and Dialga who otherwise wall this set pretty well

Set Details

========

-Max Special Attack is used so you hit the Pokemon you lure in as hard as possible
-Life Orb is used for the extra damage, but if you want to use this as a lead then a Focus Sash could also be helpful
-A Mild nature lets you almost always OHKO Groudon if have rocks up
252+ SpA Life Orb Rayquaza Draco Meteor vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Groudon: 367-433 (90.8 - 107.1%) -- 81.3% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock

Usage Tips

========

- The purpose of this set is to lure in and KO threats to the team, so you need to predict what will come in or whether to just go for the kill
- Hide Draco Meteor until you have to use it, also try and break Lugia’s Multiscale before using Draco Meteor

Team Options

========

- Stealth Rock support is almost mandatory to ensure KOs as well as break the occasional Sturdy or Focus Sash
- Rapid Spin support is suggested over Defog support as Rayquaza needs hazards to secure crucial KOs and Stealth Rock damage will quickly take its toll
- Steel-types such as Aegislash and Steel Arceus are great teammates for Rayquaza, as they resist Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon moves-, and a STAB move can heavily damage the Fairy-types that Rayquaza hates
- Blissey / Chansey as well as other Thunder Wave users are beneficial to cripple would-be revenge killers to Rayquaza such as Palkia
- (Mega) Scizor can be a decent partner since Rayquaza’s going to lure and kill off Fire-types and Scizor has priority Bullet Punch that will kill Kyurem-W and Fairy-types and can utilize a slow U-turn to allow Rayquaza to switch in unscathed


Dragon Dance

########

name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Air Lock
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty

Moves

========

- Dragon Dance allows Rayquaza to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame outside of Deoxys-S and grants it extra power
- Outrage is extremely powerful, though due to its locking effect, Dragon Claw is an worthy alternative as a reliable STAB move
- Fire Blast hits Mega Scizor, Grass Arceus, Steel Arceus, Ferrothorn reasonably hard
-Earthquake provides alternative coverage for the likes of Dialga, Aegislash, and Heatran, and allows Rayquaza to hit Fairy-types on the switch

Set Details

========

- Max Attack and Speed allow it to sweep to its maximum potential
- A Hasty nature is used so that Rayquaza can speed tie with other base 95s without gimping the power of Fire Blast, and gives Genesect an Attack boost, meaning that without prior damage, Rayquaza has a chance to survive an Ice Beam
- Life Orb is used for a needed power boost, and due to Rayquaza's frailty, the HP loss isn't too critical
- Iron Tail can be used to smash Fairy-types after a boost

Usage Tips

========

- Rayquaza’s incredibly frail so it should only switch in after something as been KO'd or by means of U-turn or Volt Switch
- Spamming Outrage if the opponent's Arceus forme has not been revealed isn't a good idea unless you are in an emergency situation, as Steel and Fairy Arceus can easily switch in and beat you.
- With this set, Rayquaza functions best as a late-game sweeper, and bringing it in too early to eat SR and LO damage may hurt you later in the game, as Rayquaza can be picked off by priority after switching into SR twice.

Team Options

========

- Stealth Rock support is almost mandatory to ensure KOs as well as break the occasional Sturdy or Focus Sash
- Rapid Spin support is suggested over Defog support as Rayquaza needs hazards to secure crucial KOs and Stealth Rock damage will quickly take its toll
- Steel-types such as Aegislash and Steel Arceus are great teammates for Rayquaza, as they resist Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon moves-, and a STAB move can heavily damage the Fairy-types that Rayquaza hates
- Blissey / Chansey as well as other Thunder Wave users are beneficial to cripple would-be revenge killers to Rayquaza such as Palkia


Other Options

########

- Outrage can be run for increased power over Dragon Claw, but the locking effect can lead to Rayquaza getting KO'd or set up on
- Flamethrower can be run over Fire Blast for consistency, but the power loss is notable and Fire Blast is not terribly inaccurate
- Iron Tail destroys Fairy Arceus and Xerneas at +1 after Stealth Rock (+1 252 Atk Life Orb Rayquaza Iron Tail vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Arceus-Fairy: 406-478 (91.4 - 107.6%) -- 50% chance to OHKO)
- Tailwind is usable on the mixed set and supports the team
- Dragon Tail is kinda usable to stop overeager set-up sweepers but Rayquaza is usually too dangerous to set up on anyway
- Substitute can be used to block status, but most Pokemon will just attack Rayquaza and KO it instead of attempting to status it
- A Focus Sash or Lum berry can be used to ease set up
- Choice items can add immediate speed or power as well as some surprise factor but the freedom to switch moves is appreciated as Rayquaza's common moves all have immunities


Checks & Counters

########

- Choice Scarf revenge killers like Palkia, Kyurem, Terrakion etc
- Bulky physical walls that don't care about Fire Blast, namely Lugia, can tank a hit and phaze Rayquaza out
- If Rayquaza doesn’t carry Earthquake then you can’t really hit Heatran hard enough before it burns you or phazes you out
- Fairy Arceus, Wallceus, and Rock Arceus shut Rayquaza down, while Xerneas, Palkia, and naturally faster threats can KO it if unboosted
- Rayquaza is fairly difficult to counter, due to its obscene power, set up moves, and excellent movepool
