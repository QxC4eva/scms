<h2>Quaza's Washington DC JAA Story</h2>

<p>Yes, this is me writing my warstory here.</p>

<p>I arrive in the mall on 10:15 AM, and go around to get Celebi and the top 20. I don't notice the line, so I cut right in front of it. No one notices. I get a Careful Celebi, frown, and then run back to the Tournament area when the 12 and under just started.</p>

<h2>12 and Under Matches</h2>

<p>There were a lot of very kidlike matches here. I saw a Rock Tomb Mewtwo, a level 31 Gloom (honestly), and someone with a level 61 Glalie. Most of the people don't have Lv.100s. I also saw many starters and Blast Burn, Hyper Beam, etc.</p>

<h2>12 and Under Finals</h2>

<p>The finalists (forgot the other guy's name, for now I'll refer to him as Kid, the other is Teague) start out with Rayquaza and Kyogre, a complete mirror match. Teague's Kyogre is faster than his clone and his Drizzle goes out first. Kid's Rayquaza, however, is faster than Teague's and OHKOs it with Ice Beam.</p>

<p>Teague sends out Swampert. Teague's Kyogre strikes Kid's Kyogre with Thunder for ~48%. The crowd boos at this, and Kid lashes back with a Thunder of his own for ~51%.</p>

<p>Rayquaza Thunderbolts Kyogre, leaving it paralyzed with 16 HP. Kyogre is paralyzed and can't move. Kid's Kyogre uses Thunder... but misses due to Air Lock sapping the rain. Swampert Ice Beams Rayquaza, leaving it with ~112 HP.</p>

<p>Teague sends out Lugia.</p>

<p>Rayquaza Body Slams Kyogre for the KO. Kid's Kyogre Surfs and does ~20% to Lugia and ~25% to Swampert. Swampert Ice Beams Rayquaza for the KO</p>

<p>Kid sends out Mewtwo</p>

<p>Mewtwo charges a Solarbeam. Lugia uses a CH Shadow Ball on Mewtwo taking it down to ~35% HP. Kyogre Thunders Lugia for ~52%. Swampert Earthquakes and KOs Mewtwo and leaves Kyogre hanging with 45 HP.</p>

<p>Kid sends out Lugia.</p>

<p>Teague's Lugia Shadow Balls Kid's Lugia for ~20% and gets a Special Defense drop. Kyogre Thunders Lugia and leaves it hanging with 5HP. Swampert KOs Kyogre with Earthquake.</p>

<p>Teague's Lugia Shadow Balls Kid's Lugia for another 20%. Kid's Lugia Aeroblasts Swampert. Swampert Ice Beams Lugia for ~35%.
***Kid's Lugia has Leftovers***</p>

<p>Teague's Lugia Shadow Balls, leaving it with 49 HP (after Leftovers). Kid's Lugia Psychics Swampert for the KO.</p>

<p>Teague's Lugia Shadow Balls Kid's Lugia for the KO</p>

<p>I got this match on video. I might upload it later, but a few minutes later we have to stand in line for the signups. My friend was there (he is quite stupid tbh). He wanted to battle me, and I said until the match finishes. Later on, I found out he wanted to battle me with a team with 999 stats.</p>

<p>I walk around; I see someone named Justin Hill which I think is Justin8649. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<h2>The 13+ Battle Begins</h2>

<p>So, I am paired up against someone named Matt.</p>
