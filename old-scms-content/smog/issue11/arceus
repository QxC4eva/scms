<h2>Introduction</h2>
 
<p>Sporting base 120 stats across the board plus a ton of moves to  choose from, Arceus can do almost anything! Arceus has another quality  that makes its already incredible versatility even more over-the-top:  Multitype. With this ability, Arceus can become any single type in the  game as long as it holds the corresponding plate! Because of this,  Arceus is so multifaceted that it's essentially the equivalent of 17  Pokémon in one, all with a 100 Base Power special STAB. There are  generally 3 different kinds of Arceus (Swords Dance, Calm Mind, and  support), but note that there are many Arceus sets that don't fall into  any of these three categories.</p>
 
<p>Arceus has only been released at level 100, meaning the only  way to give Arceus EVs is through Vitamins, which cap at 100 EVs per  stat. These EV restrictions are not programmed into Shoddy, so Arceus is  currently banned. However, the beast will be usable in Shoddy 2, and is  currently usable on the Pokémon Online battle simulator.</p>
 
<h2>Pokémon That Are More Useful in the Arceus Metagame</h2>
 
<p>In the Arceus metagame some Pokémon become more viable due to  their ability to handle multiple Arceus sets; Skarmory is one of the  most prominent examples of this. Skarmory has great typing in any tier,  and although Skarmory is good in a metagame without Arceus, it usually  has major competition for a teamslot with Forretress, and Forretress  nearly always wins because of Rapid Spin. Now, Skarmory is a lot more  useful because it can wall nearly all physical variants of Arceus thanks  to Roost. The only way a physical Arceus set can take down Skarmory is  if it includes Overheat in its moveset, which limits its coverage  against other Pokémon. If a physical Arceus lacks Overheat, Skarmory can  come in, set up Spikes, and Whirlwind Arceus away when it's done. Even  though Skarmory aims to wall physical Pokémon, it is still better to EV  it in Special Defense to allow it to take the powerful special  Dragon-type attacks of Ubers better.</p>
 
<p>Ho-Oh is another example of a Pokémon who was extremely good  pre-Arceus, but has become more useful with Arceus's introduction into  the metagame. With its 106 HP and 154 Special Defense stats along with  only 3 weaknesses, Ho-Oh has the ability to switch in and check nearly  every Calm Mind Arceus set that does not carry Thunder or a super  effective Judgment. This ability is amplified if Ho-Oh is provided with  sun support, draining Thunder's accuracy down to 50% while essentially  eliminating its Water-type weakness. Once in, Ho-Oh takes advantage of  the fact that Calm Mind sets usually lack a way to boost Defense with  powerful Brave Birds and Sacred Fires, the latter of which can burn  Arceus, a deadly effect. A +1 neutral Judgment will never OHKO the  standard Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock, meaning it may go down, but it will  probably take Arceus with it.</p>
 
<p>Latias is more useful with Arceus on the loose because Calm  Mind Arceus needs a critical hit to beat it, unless its STAB hits Latias  for super effective damage. Against Arceus, Latias needs to have  Thunder to come out on top, because if they both possess equal Calm  Minds, all it takes is one untimely full paralysis to spell the end for  Arceus because Dragon Pulse 3HKOes it. It is due to this 3HKO that  Thunder is needed for Latias to take down Arceus. It may seem unreliable  to rely on full paralysis, but it is nearly impossible to run out of  Thunder PP without first paralyzing Arceus, even in the sun! Arceus fail  to 3HKO a Latias with 154 HP investment with Ice Beam, meaning Latias  has ample time to paralyze Arceus.</p>
 
<p>With its great set of resistances, Heatran can handle multiple  Arceus sets. Any Arceus set that doesn't carry Fighting-, Ground-, or  Water-type attacks will struggle to bring the lava-loving Pokémon down.  Heatran can also Taunt Arceus to prevent it from boosting its stats or  healing, and then proceed to whittle away at Arceus's health with Toxic  or sun-boosted Flamethrowers. It can also phaze Arceus's Calm Mind  boosts away with Roar. Heatran's 91/106/106 defenses are nothing to  scoff at either, especially when complemented by its 130 base Special  Attack.</p>
 
<p>Blissey can handle many Calm Mind sets; however, she must be  careful not to run into an Arceus set with Substitute or Refresh, as  both nullify Blissey's only way of hurting Arceus: Toxic. With Blissey's  massive Special Defense and HP, Arceus needs +6 Special Attack to 2HKO  the Egg Nurse, and even then Blissey will be able to stall out a  poisoned Arceus by spamming Softboiled or Wish + Protect. However,  Blissey loses to Steel-, Poison-, and Fighting-type Arceus sets; the  former two are immune to Toxic, while the latter only needs 2 Calm Minds  to 2HKO Blissey.</p>
 
<p>Garchomp is slightly better in a metagame with Arceus. Since  Arceus has a limit of 100 EVs per stat, including Speed, Jolly Garchomp  will always outspeed Arceus. This gives Garchomp a huge advantage, being  able to use Choice Band to revenge nearly every Arceus set with  powerful Dragon- and Ground-type attacks. Alternatively, most of the  time Garchomp can take at least 1 attack from Arceus and set up a Swords  Dance in its face, then proceed to obliterate it with a Life Orb  Outrage.</p>
 
<h2>The Main Sets</h2>
 
<h3>Calm Mind</h3>
 
<p>Arceus's most commonly used set is undeniably Calm Mind. Every  single Arceus type (bar Psychic) brings something unique to that type in  the form of an extremely durable setup sweeper with reliable recovery.  Each type also has a dependable 100 Base Power STAB in the form of  Judgment, which changes its type alongside Arceus. Calm Mind sets also  have the ability to use just one attack&mdash;Judgment  normally&mdash;and simply use Recover to restore health alongside  Substitute or Refresh in the last slot to block status. It is also worth  noting that even with the EV restriction, Arceus can make 101 HP  Substitutes. Recover is a staple on nearly every single Calm Mind set;  although some types can successfully run Calm Mind + 3 attacks, it is  usually better to run Recover to capitalize on Arceus's amazing natural  bulk. The most common thing for these sets to run is 2 attacks,  including Judgment for STAB and a second attack to cover important  Pokémon that resist said STAB. For instance, Electric Arceus will  commonly use a set composed of Calm Mind / Judgment / Ice Beam / Recover  to obtain near perfect coverage. Finally, Iron Defense is sometimes  used alongside Calm Mind to create a near unbreakable tank; for  instance, Steel Arceus with Iron Defense can even set up on non-Roar  Groudon!</p>
 
<h3>Swords Dance</h3>
 
<p>The second most used Arceus set is Swords Dance. With Swords  Dance Arceus can use its bulk to obtain multiple boosts in a short  period of time and raise its Attack to astronomical levels, but this  comes with a catch. Arceus has no physical form of Judgment, and its  physical movepool is rather lackluster, meaning only a few types can  successfully run a Swords Dance set. Swords Dance also doesn't increase  any of Arceus's defensive stats, meaning it is easier to strike down  with powerful attacks. For this reason some Swords Dance sets opt to use  Cosmic Power alongside Recover to attempt a slow and steady set-up,  eventually resulting in an unstoppable offensive juggernaut.</p>
 
<h3>Support</h3>
 
<p>The final type of set Arceus can make use of is support. Arceus  has an excellent support movepool and the stats to back it up. It can  make use of sets that take advantage of Dual Screens, phazing, Stealth  Rock, and walling&mdash;the list goes on. While using these moves,  it can boost its defense stats to near-unbreakable levels with Cosmic  Power and keep itself healthy with Recover. It is worth noting that sets  such as "bulky Water Arceus" that can be duplicated by others (in this  case, Sleep Talk Kyogre) are generally a bad idea, as you can only use  one Arceus on your team, and it's important the set you pick uses Arceus  to its full potential.</p>
 
<h2>The Best of the Best</h2>
 
<p>This section will talk about a few types and why they are  considered to be "the best of the best". When reading this, please note  that this section is based off opinion, and the type you think is the  best may not be here.</p>
 
<p><strong>Dark</strong> &ndash; Dark may seem  inferior to the other types here, as it can only do one thing; however,  it does it very well. Dark Arceus is arguably the best mono-attacking  Calm Mind Arceus set. The bonus of running only one attack is that  Arceus can now run either Substitute or Refresh to eliminate troublesome  status. Its STAB has excellent coverage in the Uber tier, only resisted  by two Ubers in total, neither of which can do much once Arceus has a  Calm Mind or two under its belt. Over Ghost, Dark Arceus has the  advantage of nothing being immune to its STAB. To make the deal even  sweeter, Arceus is immune to Wobbuffet's Mirror Coat, meaning it isn't  easily shut down if Wobbuffet switches in before it gets too many Calm  Minds.</p>
 
<p><strong>Electric</strong> &ndash; At first  glance Electric may seem to be just another type, but if one takes a  closer look, they will find Electric is a cut above the rest, as it  boasts one of the best Calm Mind sets in comparison to other Arceus  types. This is due to the fact Electric Arceus achieves near perfect  type coverage with its STAB and Ice Beam, only resisted by Magnezone,  Shedinja, and Lanturn, none of which can do significant damage to  Electric Arceus. Electric typing also provides Arceus with only one  weakness, Ground, and the only Ground-types seen in Ubers are hit for  super effective damage from Ice Beam. Lastly, Electric Arceus is one of  the few Calm Mind Arceus sets that can beat Ho-Oh without taking a  significant beating.</p>
 
<p><strong>Fighting</strong> &ndash; Fighting  Arceus is great because it too receives near perfect neutral coverage  with just two attacks; however, unlike Electric, it can also run a  Swords Dance set that has perfect coverage. For its Calm Mind set, it  usually runs Dark Pulse and Judgment as the main attacks, as Dark  Pulse's flinch chance is more valuable then Shadow Ball's Special  Defense drop. For Swords Dance sets it uses Shadow Claw and Brick Break,  a combination which hits many Ubers for super effective damage. In  addition to its coverage, Fighting is also an amazing defensive type. A  resistance to Stealth Rock, coupled with only two weaknesses to types  that are rarely used (Flying and Psychic), as well as handy resistances  to Rock, Bug, and Dark.</p>
 
<p><strong>Ghost</strong> &ndash; Ghost Arceus has  a lot of valuable perks over the other types. Ghost typing grants  Arceus useful immunities to Normal- and Fighting-type attacks, as well  as the ability to block Rapid Spin, which makes it easy to fit on  offensive and stall teams alike. Ghost Arceus attains perfect coverage  in two moves, Shadow Force and Brick Break or Judgment and Focus Blast,  making it quite a potent Swords Dance or Calm Mind sweeper. Ghost Arceus  is also a capable lead; only Darkrai, Kyogre, and Tyranitar leads can  defeat it. Furthermore, Ghost Arceus is very adept defensively and is an  excellent addition to stall teams. Although Giratina is bulkier, Ghost  Arceus boasts Recover and lacks Giratina's Dragon and Ice  weaknesses.</p>
 
<p><strong>Normal</strong> &ndash; Normal Arceus  is extremely deadly if you are unprepared for it, its most dangerous set  being Swords Dance. With Swords Dance, Arceus can unleash hell upon the  opponent's team with its powerful STAB ExtremeSpeed, coming off a  healthy 120 Attack stat. Normal Arceus also has the ability to choose  its item, meaning it can hold Leftovers for recovery, a Life Orb for raw  power, or even something like Light Clay if it wants to run a Dual  Screen set! It can also hold a Choice Band to make a decent revenge  killer, with ExtremeSpeed tearing through weakened teams. Normal Arceus  is the most versatile of all the types due to its sheer  unpredictability.</p>
 
<p><strong>Steel</strong> &ndash; Steel Arceus is  hands down one of the best types. It boasts 11 resistances, including a  coveted Dragon-type resistance, with only 3 weaknesses. Most other  Steel-types possess one problem or another&mdash;not enough Special  Defense, no recovery, weak attacks&mdash;but Arceus has none of  these problems and thus makes a great addition to any team. Steel Arceus  is most adept at making use of Calm Mind sets, it often makes use only  one attack (usually Judgment) with Roar over a coverage move so it can  beat Pokémon like Latias who attempt a Calm Mind war. Swords Dance is  another option for Steel Arceus; with Iron Head for a reliable STAB, it  can use Swords Dance in conjunction with Cosmic Power and Recover to set  up on almost everything safely. Finally, Steel Arceus can make use of a  support set, such as dual screens or a tankish set, due to its great  bulk and ability to switch into many different attacks.</p>
 
<h2>Sample Team</h2>
 
After reading this you are hopefully interested in the Arceus metagame, so a sample team is provided below:
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/376.png" alt="" /><br />
Metagross @ Lum Berry<br />
Clear Body<br />
252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD<br />
Adamant Nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Meteor Mash<br />
- Bullet Punch<br />
- Explosion</p>
 
<p>Metagross aims to help the team start on the right foot. It has  the ability to limit Deoxys-S to one layer of entry hazards with Meteor  Mash + Bullet Punch, which also lets it beat Darkrai thanks to its Lum  Berry. It can also set down Stealth Rock, which aid this team's sweepers  and phazers alike. Explosion allows Metagross to strike huge damage to  any nearly any Pokémon caught in its way. When using this team, it is  better to not Explode Metagross early in the game, as it can double as a  Dragon resist later on.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/227.png" alt="" /><br />
Skarmory @ Leftovers<br />
Keen Eye<br />
252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe<br />
Careful Nature (+SpD, -SpA)<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Brave Bird<br />
- Roost<br />
- Whirlwind</p>
 
<p>Skarmory acts as this team's check to most physical Arceus  sets, and also sets up Spikes, which are very useful in Ubers. Roost  allows Skarmory to set up on a wide variety of things and Roost away any  damage taken later. Whirlwind allows Skarmory to phaze out Pokémon that  have obtained a boost or two, while making the opponent's Pokémon take  damage through entry hazards. Brave Bird may seem odd on a defensive  Pokémon, but it's a 120 Base Power STAB with few resistances. Skarmory  also serves as an invaluable Steel-type for this team, taking powerful  Dragon-type attacks.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/382.png" alt="" /><br />
Kyogre @ Choice Specs<br />
Drizzle<br />
216 HP / 252 SpA / 40 Spe<br />
Modest Nature (+SpA, -Atk)<br />
- Water Spout<br />
- Surf<br />
- Thunder<br />
- Ice Beam</p>
 
<p>Choice Specs Kyogre is a valuable addition to this team as an  extremely powerful hitter that is also able to check quite a few  Pokémon. Kyogre gives stall teams a run for their money, 2HKOing even  Blissey. Water Spout tears through teams without a proper Kyogre  counter. Surf is there for when Kyogre is at lower health and Water  Spout is no longer as powerful. Thunder and Ice Beam round off Kyogre's  coverage, hitting Water- and Dragon-types, respectively. Kyogre's bulk  should not be underestimated, either, as it will very rarely die in one  hit, and can check Pokemon such as Rock Polish Groudon. Kyogre also  serves as a valuable Ho-Oh check, canceling out the sun and outspeeding  the standard Ho-Oh set.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/380.png" alt="" /><br />
Latias @ Soul Dew<br />
Levitate<br />
160 HP / 96 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Thunder<br />
- Recover</p>
 
<p>Latias is very useful for checking many different Calm Mind  Arceus sets, as well as the ever-threatening Kyogre. Calm Mind is  crucial on this Latias, as it allows her to boost alongside the  aforementioned threats to avoid being squashed by their boosted attacks.  Dragon Pulse is there for STAB and taking out other Dragon-type  Pokémon. Thunder hits the Steel-types that resist Dragon, and sends  Kyogre to a watery grave. Maximum Speed is very useful as it allows  Latias to at least speed tie with opposing Latias and Latios, which can  be game-breaking. Latias also serves as a great check to most rain-based  teams (Kingdra needs to lock itself into Outrage to kill it).</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/498.png" alt="" /><br />
Arceus @ Spooky Plate<br />
Multitype<br />
100 HP / 100 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Timid Nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Judgment<br />
- Thunder<br />
- Recover</p>
 
<p>Arceus's purpose on this team is two-fold. It acts as a  valuable spin blocker so Skarmory and Metagross's turns spent setting up  hazards do not go to waste, but it also serves as a threatening setup  sweeper. With Ghost-type Judgment, the many Psychic-types of Ubers are  sent running for cover, with Thunder hitting the types that resist Ghost  for neutral damage. Calm Mind and Recover make Arceus a nearly  unbreakable tank as it sets up. A +Speed nature is crucial on this  Arceus (as it is with all Arceus sets bar Normal) to allow it to  outspeed max +Speed base 90s.</p>
 
<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/450.png" alt="" /><br />
Garchomp @ Choice Scarf<br />
Sand Veil<br />
4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Stone Edge</p>
 
<p>Garchomp gives this team a great revenge killer, as well as an  immunity to Thunder and its pesky 30% paralysis chance. Outrage is used  for power, and Garchomp can easily clean up with it once the opponent  has been weakened. It may seem odd to use Dragon Claw on a set with  Outrage, but it's necessary if Garchomp doesn't want (or need) to lock  itself into a move. Dragon Claw lets Garchomp eliminate things like  Palkia and Rayquaza with ease. Earthquake compliments Garchomp's Dragon  attacks by hitting the Steel-types that resist it (bar Skarmory and  Bronzong) for super effective damage. Stone Edge rounds off the set by  shooting down Ho-Oh.</p>
 
<p>Only use this team if you are really at a loss for team  building, and even then, the best way to learn about a metagame is to  build your own team and try out new things for yourself! It is also  important to note that just because you can use Arceus, doesn't mean  every team needs it to be successful. For example, Jibaku's well known  "Vulcan Fury" team (which can be viewed in the Rate My Team archive)  functions exceptionally well in the Arceus metagame.</p>
 
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
 
<p>As of right now, Arceus's effects on the metagame are  widespread. It's like adding 16.5 (Psychic Arceus is awful, so let's  just call it half of a Pokemon) Pokémon to a metagame that only had 24  to begin with! There is also the interesting subject of "what will  happen when an Arceus with no EV limit is released?". While we obviously  can't know for sure, there will most likely be a huge metagame shift,  and the Ubers metagame will become largely centralized on  Arceus.</p>
 
<p>After reading this article, if you still need more help, don't  worry&mdash;there are resources available to everyone. There is an  Ubers Simple Question Simple Answer thread where most, if not all, of  your questions can be answered! Finally, it is important to note that  because of Species Clause, you can only use one Arceus per team, so it  is of the upmost importance that you don't waste it on a gimmicky  set.</p>
