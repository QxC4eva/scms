<h2>Description</h2> 
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance of poisoning the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Poison Sting is one of the worse moves in the entire game. Ridiculously low power, extremely awful coverage, and miserable distribution are reason enough not to use this move, if any other were needed. If you want to use a physical Poison-type move, then Cross Poison, Poison Jab, and Gunk Shot are all available. Don't bother using it, simply put.</p>
