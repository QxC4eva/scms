[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Restores 25% of the holder's max HP when the holder is hit by a super effective attack. Consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Enigma Berry is one of those event items of little use. Certainly, you recover HP after taking a super effective hit, but this is small compensation for having to take the super effective hit in the first place—which is almost guaranteed to do more than 25% if it's from a moderately powerful attacker—and if your Pokemon is defensive enough to take this hit comfortably, Leftovers is probably a better idea regardless. If you really must soften a super effective hit, use a type-resistance Berry, or failing that, a Sitrus Berry. Anything but Enigma Berry, really.</p>
