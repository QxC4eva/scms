[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user goes to sleep for two turns, restores all HP, and is cured of burn, paralysis, and poison. Fails if the user has full HP, is already asleep, or if another effect is preventing sleep.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Though Rest's effects are phenomenal, the two-turn sleep it requires is usually far too long for competitive use when used alone. To remedy this, the move is often paired with elements such as Sleep Talk, Chesto Berry, or the abilities Hydration and Natural Cure. Rest is quite a potent recovery move in these cases, but should never be used on its own. When combined with the aforementioned elements, the strategy is usually referred to as RestTalk and ChestoRest for the former two.</p>

<p>Even though the downturns of sleep is somewhat debilitating, Rest is still one of the best moves in the game, and it, or one of its equivalents (Roost, Recover, Heal Order, Milk Drink, or Slack Off), is almost mandatory for any defensive Pokemon. The move is somewhat worse than in past generations because of the BW sleep mechanics resetting the sleep counter when the user switches out. Therefore, Rest users are most commonly paired with a cleric to heal the user of sleep as they switch out. While Rest is one of the best moves in the game for very bulky Pokemon, it is still highly outclassed by the aforementioned equivalents since they offer instant recovery without the downturns of sleep. They should always be used over Rest when available, and Rest will only be seen on Pokemon without said equivalents.</p>
