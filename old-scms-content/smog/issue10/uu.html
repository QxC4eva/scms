<h2>History of UU Offense</h2>

<p>At the beginning of D/P, offense was a very challenging style of play. The most offensively inclined Pokémon were physical Fighting-types, and stall could easily answer that with Pokémon such as Rotom and Nidoqueen. The lack of effective wall-breakers, Pokémon with potent offensive synergy, and general power made stall the more effective playstyle. However, as soon as the original BL Pokémon were dropped down, UU began to see a large amount of Pokémon who could just tear through most of the metagame. Staraptor, Gallade, and Honchkrow were eventually banned because they made switching in and countering so difficult. Despite these bans, UU was left with Pokémon such as Blaziken, Nidoking, Magmortar, and other heavy hitters who could 2HKO most of stall. Stall was still quite hard to beat, however, since these Pokémon are by no means durable and require prediction to use effectively. Eventually, Donphan and Dugtrio dropped in from OU; these two Pokémon helped offense quite a bit, especially Dugtrio. Since Dugtrio has the unique ability to reliably trap and KO Chansey and Registeel, many special sweepers such as Mismagius and Raikou were quite effective in tandem. After this, Rhyperior, Porygon-Z, and Alakazam (three of the most powerful Pokémon that UU has ever seen) dropped out of OU. With a Special Attack stat stat of 135, Adaptability, Nasty Plot, and Recover, Porygon-Z was quickly booted for beating stall too easily. However, Rhyperior and Alakazam still remain, boasting some of the hardest hitting moves seen in the current metagame.</p>

<h2>What Is UU Offense?</h2>

<p>"Kill or be killed" is the perfect saying to describe UU offense in a single phrase. UU offensive teams are, in the most simple definition as possible, a team made to KO all of the opponent's Pokémon before the opponent KOes all of your Pokémon. Even with such a simple definition, UU offense is one of the broadest styles of play in any metagame. The offensive combos found in many offensive UU teams keep constant pressure on an opponent and eventually break through their defenses and enable a sweep. "Offensive synergy" is often used in conjunction with or in the absence of "defensive synergy" on these teams. Let's take a look at these concepts in greater detail.</p>

<h3>Pure Offensive Synergy versus Offensive + Defensive Synergy</h3>

<p>Offensive synergy is exactly what it sounds like: two or more Pokémon that help each other sweep. Two Pokémon have both offensive and defensive synergy if they can set up on each other's weaknesses. For example, Nasty Plot Houndoom and Swords Dance Toxicroak have great offensive and defensive synergy. Houndoom sets up on most Grass-, Fire-, Psychic-, and Ghost-types while Toxicroak sets up on many Water-, Poison-, Fighting-, and Rock-types. As you can see, they cover a very broad range of Pokémon. It is also apparent that for this case, defensive synergy plays a large role in the presence of offensive synergy because each of these Pokémon are using their respective resistances and immunities to set up on the other Pokémon's weaknesses. "Pure offensive synergy" generally leaves you open to some threats, but it can create a relialble win condition under the right battle conditions.Using Pursuit Absol to remove Ghost-types along with Choice Band Tauros to sweep is an example of a combination with offensive synergy and no defensive synergy. Neither can switch into the other Pokémon's weakness(es), but one greatly improves the chances of the other sweeping - much more so than Houndoom and Toxicroak. An offensive team will often need to use both of these types of offensive synergy in order to be successful.</p>

<h2>Styles of Offense</h2>

<p>As briefly mentioned in the introduction, there are many types of offense - which often results in some silly labeling of teams. Even though these teams still follow the general rule of "kill or be killed", the playstyles themselves are quite different when you break them down.</p>

<h3>Standard Offense</h3>

<p>Standard offense is simple and effective. It generally runs a powerful offensive core, possibly with a defensive pivot. An example of an offensive core would be Venusaur, Arcanine, and Azumarill. They can all switch into their partners' counters and deal major damage to switch-ins. Teams generally rely on using offensive and defensive synergy to keep pressure on the opponent rather than luring out and beating the opponent's counters as soon as possible. Alongside a strong offensive core, standard offensive teams generally carry Stealth Rock on a defensive pivot such as Registeel, Regirock, Donphan, or even Chansey.</p>

<p>Standard offensive teams obviously need to do more than simply switch and attack; they need the ability to create some sort of win condition. With standard offense, wall-breakers are necessary. When paired with a fast and powerful sweeper, wall-breakers can quickly put the opponent in a very difficult situation. For example, if an offense player switches Blaziken into a defensive Pokémon such as Chansey, the opponent will either have to sacrifice Chansey, or risk another Pokémon be KOed. This will generally make a defensive team weak to certain sweepers. For example, Swellow can sweep if Blaziken nails Spiritomb or Omastar with Fire Blast or Superpower respectively. While this prepares offensive teams for stall, they still need a way to stop other offensive teams from sweeping. The best way to do this is to run a revenge killer, usually by means of a Choice Scarf or priority. A good Choice Scarf Pokémon will hit most of the common sweepers hard enough so that they will no longer be threatening to your team.</p>

<h4>Example of a Standard Offensive Core</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/3.png" alt="" /><br />
Venusaur (M) @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Overgrow<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Synthesis<br />
- Sludge Bomb<br />
- Leaf Storm</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/59.png" alt="" /><br />
Arcanine (M) @ Life Orb / Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flash Fire / Intimidate<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- Thunder Fang / Will-O-Wisp<br />
- ExtremeSpeed<br />
- Morning Sun</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/184.png" alt="" /><br />
Azumarill (M) @ Choice Band / Leftovers<br />
Ability: Huge Power<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Aqua Jet<br />
- Return / Double-Edge<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Waterfall / Substitute</p>

<p>These Pokémon are part of what's referred to as a "FWG (Fire, Water, and Grass) core", which is the most popular type of standard offensive core. These Pokémon both have great offensive and defensive synergy with each other. Venusaur can switch into bulky waters that Arcanine has trouble with, while Azumarill and Arcanine switch into various Fire- and Ice-type attacks. If they are too frail for your liking, certain Pokémon can be made slightly more durable by with Leftovers as their held item, but the the added power of Life Orb (or Choice Band) is generally worth it.</p>

<h4>Examples of Defensive Pivots</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/392.png" alt="" /><br />
Torterra (M) @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Overgrow<br />
EVs: 212 HP / 80 Atk / 216 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Wood Hammer / Stone Edge<br />
- Synthesis</p>

<p>Torterra is a great Pokémon for switching into Earthquake and Stone Edge, two attacking types that a FWG Core has trouble with. Torterra can then set up Stealth Rock and deal major damage with Earthquake and Wood Hammer.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/379.png" alt="" /><br />
Registeel @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 100 Atk / 156 SpD<br />
Careful nature (+SpD, -SpA)<br />
- Iron Head<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Explosion / Shadow Claw</p>

<p>Registeel is one of the bulkiest Pokémon around, and most offensive teams really appreciate the paralysis and Stealth Rock support that Registeel brings to the table. It also packs Explosion, which can turn the tide in any match if it hits a bulky Water-type or some sort of wall.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/350.png" alt="" /><br />
Milotic (M) @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Marvel Scale<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 248 Def / 8 Spe<br />
Bold nature (+Def -Atk)<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Recover<br />
- Toxic<br />
- Surf</p>

<p>Milotic is a good defensive pivot because it checks an enormous amount of Pokémon in the UU metagame. This helps offensive because it allows you to focus more on sweeping power rather than revenge killing threats. However, you'll need another Pokémon to set up Stealth Rock.</p>

<h4>Example of a Standard Offensive Wall-Breaker</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/257.png" alt="" /><br />
Blaziken (M) @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Blaze<br />
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Mild nature (+SpA, -Def)<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Vacuum Wave<br />
- Hidden Power Grass</p>

<p>A textbook example of a UU wall-breaker is Life Orb mixed Blaziken. It can switch into Pokémon such as Chansey and Registeel and then almost assuredly 1-2HKO any member of a defensive team with few exceptions. Blaziken, like most wall-breakers, is fairly slow and has a hard time sweeping other offensive teams.</p>

<h4>Example of a Standard Offensive Late Game Sweeper</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/434.png" alt="" /><br />
Mismagius (M) @ Leftovers / Life Orb<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Thunderbolt / Hidden Power Ground</p>

<p>Mismagius can pull off a sweep against offense, stall, and balance once her counters are weakened enough by a team's core. With high Speed, Special Attack, and great coverage, this is no surprise.</p>

<h4>Examples of Standard Offensive Revenge Killers</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/3.png" alt="" /><br />
Venusaur (M) @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Overgrow<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Leaf Storm<br />
- Sludge Bomb<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>Venusaur can easily revenge kill major Speed-boosting threats such as Rhyperior and Torterra. It can also deal with faster sweepers like Swellow, Alakazam, and Mismagius.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/484.png" alt="" /><br />
Rotom @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Hidden Power Ice<br />
- Trick</p>

<p>Rotom, like Venusaur, can easily revenge kill many Pokémon that have a +2 Speed boost, including some Rain Dance sweepers. Rotom can also work well against stall because of Trick.</p>

<h3>Dual Screen Offense</h3>

<p>Dual Screen offense, or DS offense, is known for using a Stealth Rock lead that also carries Reflect and Light Screen. Behind these screens, many set-up Pokémon have an easy time getting their respective boosts. This is one of the simplest teams to build, since it's basically a team of sweepers that set up and beat different threats.</p>

<p>DS offense is effective because it takes advantage of Reflect and Light Screen that last for 8 turns. Once the screens are set up, the lead either Explodes, U-turns, or switches out to the preferred sweeper. The early game set up sweepers are generally attack boosters to ensure that they cause some serious damage. A DS offense team will often use 2-3 Swords Dance or Nasty Plot Pokémon, along with 1-2 Rock Polish or Agility Pokémon. The role of the Swords Dance and Nasty Plot Pokémon is to weaken the opponent's team to the point where the Speed-boosting Pokémon can sweep. Additionally, DS offense teams generally carry an "insurance screener" that can set up screens in the middle of a match if the team doesn't win early enough.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this style of play is a pretty big gamble. You need your opponents to not be using: Taunt, sleep-inducing moves, Roar, phazing moves, or Brick Break to work effectively. Paralysis is also detrimental, but not as much as one would think. Most of the heavy hitters don't mind, since they can usually take an attack and hit back more than twice as hard.</p>

<h4>Example of Dual Screen Offense Lead</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/485.png" alt="" /><br />
Uxie @ Light Clay<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Reflect<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Light Screen<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>The most popular Dual Screen lead by a large margin is Uxie. Uxie is bulky, has Stealth Rock, Dual Screens, and the ability to U-turn out and set up another set of screens later on.</p>

<h4>Examples of "(Special) Attack Boosters"</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/229.png" alt="" /><br />
Houndoom (M) @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 96 Atk / 188 SpA / 224 Spe<br />
Hasty nature (+Spe, -Def)<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Dark Pulse<br />
- Sucker Punch / Beat Up</p>

<p>Houndoom can set up Nasty Plot and destroy most of the metagame with relative ease. It can run Beat Up to get through Chansey if it wishes.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/359.png" alt="" /><br />
Absol (M) @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Night Slash<br />
- Superpower</p>

<p>Absol, like Houndoom, can set up +2 and destroy most of the metagame. Absol is also very hard to revenge kill due to Sucker Punch, which makes it that much harder for any offensive team to stop.</p>

<h4>Example of a "Speed Booster"</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/469.png" alt="" /><br />
Rhyperior (M) @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Solid Rock<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Rock Polish<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Megahorn</p>

<p>Rhyperior can absolutely plow through a weakened team, especially when such checks as Milotic and Tangrowth are weakened. Rhyperior can also take many priority and Choice Scarf attacks with ease thanks to the protection of Dual Screens.</p>

<h3>"Hyper Offense"</h3>

<p>The term "hyper offense" frustrates many users, but this is really the best known name for this playstyle. A hyper offensive team is generally very similar to a Dual Screen team. In fact, a Dual Screen offensive team <em>is</em> a hyper offensive team. Hyper offensive teams generally refer to teams that use reckless offense and focus fire on a certain wall in order for another Pokémon to sweep. Hyper offense can also use Pokémon like Pursuit Houndoom with Choice Band Tauros, who have no defensive synergy but help create a win condition fairly quickly. Dugtrio is also a very effective trapper for Pokémon such as Swellow.</p>

<p>Hyper offensive teams are also famous for using "lures". A lure is a Pokémon that quite literally lures in and severely weakens specific Pokémon on the opponent's team if they are present. For example, if Kabutops was to set up Swords Dance as Tangrowth came in, he would deal a large amount of damage to Tangrowth even though he faints in the process. This opens the door for Pokémon such as Rock Polish Torterra, who are only countered by Tangrowth. With Tangrowth unable to take a Stone Edge after Kabutops does upwards of 80% damage to it, Torterra can generally come in and set up a sweep. Lures can also be Pokémon who use Explosion to beat a counter they generally wouldn't. For example, one could use Regirock with Passho Berry to lure in Milotic and OHKO it with Explosion as it easily survives a Surf.</p>

<p>Rain Dance teams, Sunny Day teams, and Trick Room teams are all forms of hyper offense as well. They constantly put pressure on the opponent until they eventually break through a wall and sweep. Rain Dance does this particularly well with its powerful Water-type sweepers.</p>

<h4>Examples of Hyper Offensive Combos</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/257.png" alt="" /><br />
Blaziken (M) @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Blaze<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- Low Kick<br />
- ThunderPunch</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/59.png" alt="" /><br />
Arcanine (M) @ Life Orb / Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flash Fire / Intimidate<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Flare Blitz<br />
- Thunder Fang / Will-O-Wisp<br />
- ExtremeSpeed<br />
- Morning Sun</p>

<p>Blaziken can come in on a resisted attack and set up a Swords Dance. The opponent will generally send in their bulky Water-type to stop it; however once Blaziken has a Swords Dance, nothing can stand in its way. This means that the Water-type will generally be sacrificed and Blaziken will then likely be revenge killed. After this occurs, Arcanine can come in and abuse its high Speed and power to sweep late game. With its main counter removed, there isn't much a team can do to stop Arcanine.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/229.png" alt="" /><br />
Houndoom (M) @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Hasty nature (+Spe, -Def)<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Thunder Fang<br />
- Fire Blast</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/128.png" alt="" /><br />
Tauros (M) @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Double-Edge / Return<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Pursuit / Payback</p>

<p>This underrated combo involves a very simple and effective strategy. Choice Band Tauros is sent in on an immunity or revenge kill to lure out a Ghost-type. This means one can switch in Houndoom, one of the best Ghost-type trappers in the metagame, and trap that Ghost-type. With that Ghost-type removed, Choice Band Tauros can spam his boosted Double-Edge, which is a very hard move to take even when resisted.</p>

<h4>Examples of Hyper Offensive Lures</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/377.png" alt="" /><br />
Regirock @ Passho Berry<br />
Ability: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Rock Polish / Stealth Rock</p>

<p>One of the most surprising lures is a Pokémon who is generally defensive but packs a resist berry and Explosion. Milotic or Slowbro will generally switch into Regirock quite easily, but they will regret it after they eat an Explosion to the face. This will open up a team to various Fire- and Water-type threats.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/469.png" alt="" /><br />
Rhyperior (M) @ Passho Berry / Rindo Berry<br />
Ability: Solid Rock<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Megahorn</p>

<p>This is another great bulky Water- and Grass-type lure. Rhyperior can set up a Swords Dance on the switch, survive the 4x super effective attack, and OHKO the would-be counter with Megahorn or Earthquake.</p>

<h3>Spikestacking Offense</h3>

<p>Spikestacking offense is exactly what it sounds like: a team that sets up Spikes. Most Spikestacking teams run a user of Spikes and Stealth Rock along with some sweepers who take advantage of these hazards. The most effective Spikestacking teams in the current metagame usually carry suicide leads such as Qwilfish or Omastar to set up as many entry hazards as possible before they die. Qwilfish is particularly effective because it can use Explosion on a possible Rapid Spinner, whereas Omastar has the advantage of setting up both Stealth Rock and Spikes. In addition to the lead and sweepers, many Spikestacking teams run a defensive pivot that can set up Stealth Rock, and either use Explosion or Roar to prevent Rapid Spin and spread damage respectively.</p>

<p>With Spikestacking teams, keeping the pressure on a opponent is very important. If the foe has to keep switching to deal with your Pokémon, you're eventually going to wear them out. This is why Spikestacking teams work well with standard offensive cores and wall-breakers. Certain wall-breakers in particular make sure your opponent does not have a chance to Rapid Spin. These Pokémon can be described as "Anti-Rapid Spin" Pokémon.</p>

<p>There are specific Pokémon that can abuse Spikes substantially well in comparison to others. Pokémon with U-turn, such as Swellow and Ambipom, work exceptionally well with Spikes. After a couple of U-turns, Pokémon like Rhyperior and Aggron will not be able to take Swellow's Facade anymore and allow Swellow to sweep. Another Pokémon who really benefits from Spikes is Moltres. Modest Moltres can 2HKO Chansey with Fire Blast with both Spikes and Stealth Rock on the field. Timid Moltres needs Spikes and Stealth Rock to 2HKO most variants of Milotic.</p>

<p>Keeping pressure on an opponent is important, but sometimes it's just not possible and they'll send out a Rapid Spinner on the revenge kill. This is why Ghost-types are so important when using Spikestacking teams. With a suicide lead, you're not likely able to get Spikes up more than once, and without a Ghost-type, it's easy to lose those initial Spikes. Rotom, Mismagius, and Spiritomb are quite useful on Spikestacking offense teams because not only do they deal with Rapid Spinners, they can also sweep or Trick Choice items onto stall teams.</p>

<h4>Examples of Suicide Leads</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/211.png" alt="" /><br />
Qwilfish (M) @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Poison Point<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Explosion<br />
- Waterfall / Aqua Jet</p>

<p>Qwilfish is fast, can Taunt to prevent opponent's setup, and can reliably set up Spikes against most common leads. On top of this, it can Explode on Rapid Spinners.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/139.png" alt="" /><br />
Omastar (M) @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Swift Swim<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk)<br />
- Surf<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Hidden Power Grass</p>

Omastar, while slower and lacking Explosion, can reliably set up both Spikes and Stealth Rock without using another dedicated Stealth Rocker. Omastar also is quite powerful with 349 Special Attack, not many Rapid Spin users enjoy switching in. A Ghost-type is more important with Omastar though, in case they switch into Spikes, Stealth Rock, or a resisted attack.

<h4>Examples of "Anti-Rapid Spin" Pokémon</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/146.png" alt="" /><br />
Moltres @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk) / Modest nature (+SpA, -Atk)<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Roost<br />
- Air Slash<br />
- Hidden Power Grass</p>

<p>Moltres 2HKOes almost every Rapid Spinner with Fire Blast and a followup coverage move. It also OHKOes many Rapid Spinners, with Hidden Power Grass (Kabutops), Air Slash (Hitmontop), and Fire Blast (Donphan).</p>

<h4>Examples of Spikes Abusers</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/146.png" alt="" /><br />
Moltres @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid nature (+Spe, -Atk) / Modest nature (+SpA, -Atk)<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Roost<br />
- Air Slash<br />
- Hidden Power Grass</p>

<p>Moltres is not only one of the best Anti-Rapid Spin Pokémon; it is also one of the best Spikes abusers. With Spikes in play, three-fourths of Moltres' original switch-ins can no longer switch in.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/277.png" alt="" /><br />
Swellow (M) @ Toxic Orb<br />
Ability: Guts<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly nature (+Spe, -SpA)<br />
- Quick Attack<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Facade<br />
- Brave Bird</p>

<p>Swellow, with U-turn, can eventually bypass almost all its counters. It goes from approximately 25 viable switch-ins to about 5 after 1-2 U-turns with Spikes and Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<h3>Bulky Offense</h3>

<p>Bulky offense, often confused with balance, uses slow, bulky, heavy hitters. These "tanks", such as Torterra, Rhyperior, and Arcanine (with slightly defensive EVs), are great at abusing the their ability check many threats while also dishing out major damage. Bulky offense generally uses paralysis from a defensive Pokémon or two in order to sweep. These teams stay away from fast and frail revenge killers, and focus more on taking a hit and OHKOing back. A bulky offensive team generally relies on Pokémon with Calm Mind as opposed to Nasty Plot and Leftovers as opposed to Life Orb. For example, a standard offensive team might use Choice Scarf or Life Orb Rotom, while a bulky offense team would lean towards a Substitute + Will-O-Wisp Rotom. Mismagius would generally run a SubCM set rather than a Nasty Plot + Taunt set.</p>

<h4>Examples of "Tanks"</h4>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/469.png" alt="" /><br />
Rhyperior (M) @ Leftovers / Choice Band<br />
Ability: Solid Rock<br />
EVs: 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Megahorn<br />
- Rock Blast / Substitute</p>

<p>Rhyperior can switch into a ton of offensive Pokémon, including Swellow, and nail the switch with an incredibly hard Choice Band boosted attack. It can also set up a Substitute and proceed to dismantle many offensive teams. It can also plow through stall, making it an excellent addition to any bulky offense team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/dp/392.png" alt="" /><br />
Torterra (M) @ Life Orb / Leftovers<br />
Ability: Overgrow<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant nature (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Wood Hammer<br />
- Synthesis / Substitute</p>

<p>With excellent resistances and bulk, Torterra makes a great addition to bulky offense. It can switch in quite easily, and bring the pain with its excellent Attack stat and powerful STAB moves.</p>

<h2>How Offense Does Against Other Teams:</h2>

<h4>Vs. Stall</h4>

<p>The most concerning style of team for offense to play against is generally stall. If your team cannot break through most defensive cores, you're going to automatically lose to any competent stall player. While most offensive teams use wall-breakers to tear down certain defensive Pokémon, these wall-breakers are often stopped cold by other members of the stall team. Double switching, one of the most critical techniques when playing offense against stall, is where after making one switch, you predict the opponent's next switch-in and make your own switch accordingly. For example, if I send in Moltres out against a stall team, they'll almost certainly send in Milotic or Chansey. If I then immediately bring out a physical Venusaur, the foe is put in an awkward predicament. Will you use Sleep Powder? Will you use Power Whip? Sludge Bomb? Are you special or physical? It's hard for a stall team to get out of this scenario without losing something in the process. Risk-taking is critical in beating a conservative stall player with an offensive team.</p>

<h4>Vs. Balance</h4>

<p>Balanced teams give offensive teams a lot of trouble, as they generally won't have the time to set up. It's difficult finding an opportunity to switch in your heavy hitters against a balanced team that packs their own heavy hitters. Against balance, it's important to get Stealth Rock (and Spikes if possible) up as soon as possible and then keep the pressure on. Since you'll generally be more threatening than them, you will need to make sure that they don't get a chance to set one of their sweepers up before you wear down their defenses. This is especially critical because offensive teams mostly lack the defensive checks that balanced teams carry.</p>

<h4>Vs. Other Offensive Teams</h4>

<p>Offense vs. offense tends to make for the most fast-paced and exciting matches around. The key in these matches is to know when and what to sacrifice. If the opponent brings Rotom in as their only check to your Swellow, you should sacrifice another one of your less-valuable Pokémon and bring in a Pursuiter to open up a sweep. One Pokémon can bring you back from the brink of annihilation if the opponent's checks to it are gone. Speed is key against other offensive teams.</p>

<h2>Why Use Offense?</h2>

<p>Offense allows you to dictate the pace of the match. Stall can't slow down a match if you are carrying a couple set up sweepers with Taunt or hard-hitting attacks. Additionally, with the addition of D/P items, Pokémon, and moves, it has grown much harder to cover every threat defensively. With stall, there's always going to be a chance that the opponent has one of the Pokémon you can't deal with. With offense, you simply "kill or be killed", regardless of what your opponent does.</p>

<p>The most important reason to run offense is that it's fun. Stall tends to be slow-paced and boring, while offense focuses on beating something's face in, which is very entertaining. If you're a ballsy player who wants to play a fast-paced match, give offense a try!</p>
