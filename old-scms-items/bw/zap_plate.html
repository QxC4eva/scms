[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hold item that increases the Base Power of all Electric-type moves by 20%. When held by a Pokemon with the Multitype ability, the holder's type will change to Electric.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Electric Arceus is an incredibly potent offensive threat, despite being somewhat lackluster as a defensive Pokemon due to its lack of resistances. STAB Electric-type moves are incredibly potent in Ubers, and when backed by Ice Beam, Electric Arceus gains the BoltBeam attacking combination, allowing it to lay waste to many other Pokemon with just a Calm Mind Boost. However, Electric Arceus will often find itself struggling to fight off special walls such as Blissey.</p>

<p>However, it is generally useless aside from Arceus, as most other Electric-types find the power boost from Zap Plate to be too menial.</p>

<h2>Location</h2> 
<p>Abyssal Ruins, 1F.</p>
