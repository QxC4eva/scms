Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Superpower / Earthquake
move 4: U-turn
ability: Sheer Force
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========
- Flare Blitz is Darmanitan's most powerful STAB; along with the boost from Sheer Force, it hits everything not resistant to it hard.
- Rock Slide covers Dragonite, Gyarados, and many opposing Fire-types.
- Both Superpower and Earthquake hit Tyranitar and Heatran, with them hitting one over the other for more damage.
- U-Turn gains momentum, scouting for switches in order to switch in a more favorable matchup; this is especially useful for a Choice wielder.

Set Details
========
- Choice Scarf defines it's role as a revenge killer.
- EV spread is standard for Darmanitan, maxing out Atk and Spe.
- An Adamant nature is preferred for this set, as Darmanitan wants as much power it can get.
- However, a Jolly nature allows Darmanitan to outspeed and revenge kill neutral-natured base 100 Speed threats at +1, such as Mega Charizard X.

Usage Tips
========
- With a Choice Scarf, Darmanitan is great at coming in for revenge kills, KO'ing normally faster, frailer Pokemon.
- Late-game, it can potentially clean up the opponent's team once they've been significantly weakened.
- Bear in mind that if the opponent has set up Stealth Rock and or additional hazards, it may be wise to keep Darmanitan out of the fray unless it can come in on a Pokemon it can threaten, or if hazards have been removed.

Team Options
========
- A good spinner or Defogger is necessary, as Darmanitan's role as a revenge killer means that it will be switching out frequently, and Stealth Rock and recoil damage will make short work of it otherwise. Starmie, Mega Blastoise, Latias, and Scizor are adept at this and share decent synergy with Darmanitan.
- Teammates that can soften bulky Water-types for Darmanitan are appreciated, with Celebi, Kyurem-B, and Mega Venusaur being suitable.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Superpower / Earthquake
move 4: Earthquake / Superpower / U-turn
ability: Sheer Force
item: Life Orb / Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========
- Flare Blitz is it's most powerful STAB, packing a ridiculous punch.
- Rock Slide provides additional coverage against various Fire and Flying-types that resist Flare Blitz, and Sheer Force increases it's power output near that of Stone Edge.
- Superpower and Earthquake both hit Tyranitar and Heatran, with the former ensuring the OHKO on Tyranitar, and the latter ensuring the OHKO on Heatran.
- U-Turn is usable to maintain momentum.

Set Details
========
- A Life Orb is standard for the power boost, but with a Choice Band, Darmanitan refrains from additional recoil and gains even more power, albeit being restricted to a single move.
- Adamant is once again preferred for maximum wallbreaking potential, and outspeeds up to positive-natured Gyarados, though Jolly lets it outspeed up to positive-natured base 100s.

Usage Tips
========
- Use it as a wall breaker, since STAB Flare Blitz threatens many Pokemon, while it's coverage moves hit most Pokemon that Flare Blitz doesn't.
- Decent Speed lets it outpace most, if not every, relevant defensive threat.
- U-turn may cause your opponent to think you're using a Choice Scarf.

Team Options
========
- Per usual, a Rapid Spinner or Defogger is crucial in order to make the most out of Darmanitan's longevity without being neutered by entry hazards.
- Darmanitan is sufficient at punching holes mid-game, so sweepers that can clean up weakened teams with ease, such as Dragonite, Gyarados, and Suicune, make good teammates.
- As with the Choice Scarf set, teammates capable of handling Water-types that may be a burden to Darmanitan are still appreciated.
