Overview
########
Hippopotas has great bulk and a good support movepool&mdash;but its main niche lies in setting up sand. Its unique ability and utility moves in Stealth Rock, Slack Off, and Whirlwind grant it a spot on certain teams. The nerf to sand has not been kind to it, however, and makes Pokemon that utilize sand, such as Drilbur, less potent when used in tandem with Hippopotas. Regardless, Hippopotas has a somewhat solid niche&mdash;that of a sand setter&mdash;and it should not stray away from said niche.

Moves
========
eq is stab and does good dmg to most stuff
slack off provides recovery
sr is for support i mean duh
whirlwind lets hippo phaze stuff like sd gar so it wont become setup bait
Set Details
========
evio for max bulk; lets it take on attackers such as mixkrow better
spread for fuckign over sun
rock slide is cool to hit murkrow and uhhhhhhhhhhhh fletchling ?_?
smooth rock is an option to allow stuff like drilbur to wreck shit
special bulk screws over vulpix, seriously fuck sun >:(
Usage Tips
========
Hippo should be brought in as weather control and also to check physical attackers; dont bring it in on every physical attacker as it gets worn down easily and cant heal later otherwise
Bringing it in on sun sweepers that use chloro might seem dumb but good prediction and you can shut down their annoying antics if they are running solarbeam. also vulpix hates an eq even after will-o
dont use sr often when there is a likely defogger such as vullaby or dumb shit like that lol
use whirlwind against setup sweepers often, but if you are against something that has a choice of either setting up or hitting you and bringing you to really low health, slack off best option
against physical attackers that dont set up and cant 2hko hippo, use eq to wear em down
Team Options
========
VULLABY; overcoat fuck yeah + gud synirgy
lileep gets sandstorm boost and takes water attacks
keep in mind that above 2 mons compound ice weakness so waters w/ ice beam are a bitch so something like munchlax is cool<---worn down by sand tho
pawniard can deal with snover though it's kinda irrelevant ?_?
gligar and drilbur utilize sand(sand veil and sand rush respectively), making them good partners.
something that deals with gligga; archen bronzor etc are solid
Other Options
########
ice fang but doesnt ohko gar either and fucking berry juice boost >_> loses thus
crunch 4 missy but not much else
stockpile ?_?
sand force so that you can use it as a bulky mon but kinda redundant w/ niche >_> never ever use pls
Checks & Counters
########

**Snover**: remove weather kill shit etc.
**Flying types**: NATU bad at countering hippo, is it (horrible pun) Gligar sds. eq. hit hard hippo, hippo cant do much back except phaze. Mantyke can destroy poor hippo with water stab and eq doesnt do anything. vullaby can taunt hippo and wear it down w/ air slash and knock off. archen defogs and hits hard, but cant 2hko. still it can set up its own rocks =)
**Misdreavus**: Will-O-Wisp, NP and attack, TAUNT... While phazing hurts, missy has ways of getting around it
**Tesshido**: fuk ferroseed, leech seed, spikes, does shit, takes eq for breakfast
**Water-types**: slowpoke uses scald, ggwp, toxic sucks tho; staryu uses water stab, ggwp, also natural cure 4 toxic :D; Carvanha is like fuk u one of the few physical attackers that effortlessly get past hippo but eq hurts
