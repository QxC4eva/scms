<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When a Pokemon connects with a contact move against the wielder, there is a 30% chance of burning it. Flame Body has a separate chance of activation on each hit of a contact multi-hit move, and can status a Pokemon multiple times if the first status is removed by the effect of <a href="/bw/items/lum_berry">Lum Berry</a> or similar items. Flame Body is prevented by <a href="/bw/moves/safeguard">Safeguard</a>, but not by <a href="/bw/moves/substitute">Substitute</a>.</p> 

<p><When the wielder is in the party the Egg counter goes down by two (not one) every 255 steps. This causes Eggs to hatch in half their usual number of steps if they have an even initial Egg count and half + 255 if they have an odd initial Egg count.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Flame Body is a strange cushion against physical assaults. Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/volcarona">Volcarona</a> typically use Fighting-type assaults as an opportunity to switch in, and a lucky Flame Body activation can cripple the opponent should they lack <a href="/bw/abilities/guts">Guts</a>, giving your Pokemon a golden opportunity to set up. It should not be chosen on Pokemon such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/heatran">Heatran</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/magmortar">Magmortar</a> who have more reliable abilities like <a href="/bw/abilities/flash_fire">Flash Fire</a> or <a href="/bw/abilities/vital_spirit">Vital Spirit</a>, respectively, but it's not too bad on Pokemon stuck with it. Flame Body works best on Pokemon that have high Defense and can easily switch into physical contact attacks in order for Flame Body to activate effectively. It should also be noted that burning a <a href="/bw/moves/fake_out">Fake Out</a> user with the aid of Flame Body is absolutely hilarious.</p>
