<p>Welcome to our third Puzzle Page here at The Smog! As always, we're open to feedback; if there's some type of puzzle you'd like to see included next issue, or if you have a gripe with this issue's puzzles, feel free to send a VM to Level 51 or air your opinion in the feedback poll or release thread.</p>
<p>Once again, congratulations to the six astute users who won prizes last issue! 8-BIT Luster and xfix showed that their ears clearly have the mettle of a truly seasoned Pok&eacute;mon master, while Obvious Power, Anty, and ethan06 came away tops in their Pok&eacute;mon-related knowledge, with perfect scores on the parameter puzzles! Finally, RitterCat performed arguably the most impressive feat of the six, submitting a completely correct crossword grid in just over 24 hours after the issue's release! We'll be contacting RitterCat about his custom avatar shortly.</p>

<h2>Parameter Puzzles</h2>
<p>Your challenge for these questions is to obtain the given list of Pok&eacute;mon from the "/dexsearch" command on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! using the correct number of parameters as shown! Note that "all" does not count as a parameter and that the exclusions mentioned are included in the total number of parameters. Can you figure out which parameters were used to obtain these results?</p>
<p>Simply type "/dexsearch" on Pok&eacute;mon Showdown! for a quick introduction on how the command works. The first three users to send in all 15 correct answers will earn themselves a custom title on the Smogon Forums; failing which, the first three users with the highest scores will earn these custom titles instead!</p>
