Scatters coins.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. In-game, if the user of the move wins the battle, money equal to five times the user's level is collected after the battle concludes. Holding the item Amulet Coin or Luck Incense doubles the amount of money recovered.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Due to its pitiful 40 Base Power, Pay Day is not a very good move at all. In addition, the only Pokemon that could possibly abuse it with STAB is Snorlax, but it has access to much better Normal-type moves in the form of Body Slam and Return anyway.</p>
