Monthly Art Contest #3: Stark Contrast
[head]

[page]

<p>With the previous two themes being fairly restrictive&mdash;or, from a positive perspective, more focused&mdash;the MAC then leaped out into the world of variety with its third theme: 'Stark Contrast'. The premise was to create a piece with two noticeably different colors. It seemed that this was a chance for some of Smogon's most professional (and, in many cases, actual professionals) to shine, and it was a close fight for the top spot!</p>
