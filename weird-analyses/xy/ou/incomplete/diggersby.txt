
Overview
######
Pros:

    Obscene attack thanks to Huge Power
    Decent Base 78 Speed outspeeds most walls, and has Agility to boost this
    Powerful Physical STABs in Frustration and Earthquake
    decent coverage options in Stone Edge and Wild Charge

Cons:
#####

    Normal STAB isnt the greatest
    Hard to set up due to average at best bulk
    It's speed, while ok, isnt great for a sweeper without an agility boost

Swords Dance
########
name: sweeper
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Return
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Quick Attack
ability: Huge Power
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spd
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
=====

    Swords Dance boosts Diggersby's Attack to astronomical levels and allows it to sweep
    Return is a powerful STAB with neutral coverage
    Earthquake is a great move to have, and pairs good with Return
    Quick Attack is priority, while weak, but is nice to pick off frail attackers
    Agility can make a double dance set that can destroy weakened offence teams, but Priority is usually preferred

Set Details
======

    Obvious ability is obvious
    Life Orb boosts Diggersby's power even higher. Silk Scarf can also be used to boost REturn and Quick Attack while keeping longevity
    Evs are simple, letting Diggersby use its decent speed to the fullest
    Adamant or Jolly can be used on either set, it is up to preference on power or speed

Usage Tips
======

    Should come in on set-up bait such as Forretress
    Swords Dance should be saved for late game, until walls such as Skarmory and Mega Aggron are gone, as well as priority from Lucario and Talonflame
    If you are carrying double set-up, Agility should be used against more offensive teams, wheras Swords Dance can be setup against Stall teams that Diggersby already outspeeds

Team Options
======

    Pokemon that can take care of Ghost types such as Trevenant and Gengar help: Charizard and Talonflame are quite good against both
    Skarmory is a huge problem; Heatran can help with this and provide Stealth Rock support and deal with Talonflame, who is a thorn in Diggersby's side
