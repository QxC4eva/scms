<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Changes the user's type to match that of the target. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute. When used against a Pokemon with Illusion, it will copy the target's actual type, and not the Illusion's. This move fails against Pokemon with Multitype.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Reflect Type is an obscure move with low distribution that is really only featured on a specialized, and somewhat gimmicky, Latias set. This set consists of Reflect Type with Calm Mind and Recover to boost up and attempt a bulky sweep that is augmented by the Steel typing Latias copies from common switch-ins, namely Ferrothorn and Jirachi. With the superior Steel typing, a couple of Calm Minds under its belt, and Levitate as an ability, Latias becomes nigh impenetrable. However, the set is a bit gimmicky because it's dependent on your opponent carrying a Steel-type that Latias can set up against, and Reflect Type takes up a moveslot that could be used instead for another coverage move.</p>
