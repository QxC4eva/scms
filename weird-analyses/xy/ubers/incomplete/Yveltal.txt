Overview
########

    Incredible versatility-can run both offensive and defensive sets with great effect
    Powerful offensive stats and possesses a STAB combo that is not resisted by much
    Dark Aura means its Dark-type moves hurt. Yveltal also possesses the strongest Sucker Punch in the game
    Oblivion Wing and Roost grants it almost unmatched sustain.
    Can cover uninvested stats through Foul Play, Oblivion Wing, and Sucker Punch.
    Resists Ghost
    Not a base 90 Speed Uber
    Has some annoying weaknesses.
    99 base Speed isn’t exactly awesome.



Taunt + 3 Attacks
########
name: Taunt + 3 Attacks
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Oblivion Wing
move 3: Dark Pulse
move 4: Sucker Punch / Foul Play / Focus Blast
ability: Dark Aura
item: Life Orb
nature: Rash / Mild / Naive / Hasty
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Dark Aura boosted Sucker Punch hurts and can easily deal >50% to many Ubers. Examples include Kyogre, Palkia, and Mewtwo.
    Taunt can give walls a hard time and can combo into Sucker Punch. First move on the set because it's very strong in the current stallish metagame.
    Oblivion Wing is a hard hitting coverage STAB that gives Yveltal an unreal amount of sustain.
    Either Dark Pulse or Foul Play can work here. Dark Pulse deals more consistent damage against the likes of Dialga, Giratina, Groudon, and some Arceus formes.
    Foul Play heavily damages Ho-Oh and still deals a lot of damage to most of the same enemies that Dark Pulse hits. Running both can be a viable option
    Focus Blast hits TTar who otherwise walls this set. Also chunks Dialga, Normal Arceus, and Rock Arceus quite nicely


Set Details
========

    Rash / Mild will provide you with the most power. Choose the nature based on your team’s needs.
    Naïve / Hasty ensures that Yveltal will outrun +Speed base 90s and 95s.
    Between Foul Play and Sucker Punch, Yveltal can creatively tweak its EV spread. For example, putting a lot of investment in Defense makes it a decent check to Extremekiller and Mega Mewtwo X.


Usage Tips
========

    Just kill things
    Try not to be predictable with Sucker Punch. Thankfully, Yveltal isn’t reliant on it.
    Strong at all points of the game, and can likely survive for that long.


Team Options
========

    Aegislash covers most of Yveltal’s weaknesses and counters Xerneas.
    Mega Gengar can trap and kill Fairyceus.
    If you don’t have Foul Play, a Ho-Oh counter such as Rock Arceus can help immensely
    A Zekrom check is appreciated. Groudon, Dialga and Ground Arceus are fair options.
    Defog support to get rid of Stealth Rock.



Special Tank
########
name: Special Tank
move 1: Foul Play
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Roost
ability: Dark Aura
item: Leftovers
nature: Calm
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpD / 8 Def

Moves
========

    Taunt grants it an additional utility as a wallbreaker.
    Toxic cripples Fairyceus and Xerneas, as well as things like Ho-Oh, Lugia, etc.
    Foul Play punishes enemies for trying to take advantage of Yveltal’s uninvested Defense stat. As a bonus, Yveltal is immune to Psystrike.
    Roost is mandatory for sustain – Oblivion Wing will not recover enough to make it a dedicated staller
    Sucker Punch can be an option somewhere. It is still extremely powerful even without investment, easily OHKOing Mega Mewtwo Y.


Set Details
========

    Strong enough to stall out certain special attackers such as Palkia, Dialga, and weakened Choice Scarf Kyogre. It is also not 2HKOed by Mega Mewtwo Y’s Ice Beam, making Yveltal an excellent check to it. (maybe throw some calcs?)
    EV spread maximizes special bulk. 248 HP instead of 252 HP to minimize Stealth Rock damage.


Usage Tips
========

    Try to predict Ho-Oh, Xerneas, and Fairy Arceus switch ins with Toxic
    Get used to understanding its tanking limits. Yveltal can easily stall a weakened Scarfogre out of Drizzle turns, but don’t try to stall Kyurem-W. For numbers sake the SpDef variant has approximately 3.3% more special bulk than 248 HP / 0 SpD Ho-Oh.
    Avoid getting Toxiced at all costs because it will completely nullify your stalling ability. Be careful when sending Yveltal in on Aegislash.


Team Options
========

    Nothing really different from the previous one, but due to the defensive nature of this set, more defensive teammates synergize better. Blissey is an example (Wish/Aroma support).

Physical Tank
########
name: Physical Tank
move 1: Foul Play
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Toxic / Sucker Punch
move 4: Roost
ability: Dark Aura
item: Leftovers / Rocky Helmet
nature: Bold / Impish
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD

Moves
========

    Taunt grants it an additional utility as a wallbreaker.
    Foul Play helps this set define its role - it allows Yveltal to punish powerful physical attackers, while using its respectable physical bulk to tank them.
    Toxic cripples Fairyceus and Xerneas, as well as things like Ho-Oh, Lugia, etc.
    Roost is mandatory for sustain – Oblivion Wing will not recover enough to make it a dedicated staller
    Sucker Punch can be an option somewhere. It is still extremely powerful even without investment, easily OHKOing Mega Mewtwo Y.


Set Details
========

    Is physically bulkier than 252/252+ Skarmory
    It can check Mega Mewtwo X and various forms of Swords Dance Arceus. Notable ones include Ground, Normal, and Ghost.
    Rocky Helmet can put +2 Extremekiller into Foul Play kill range if it decides to use Extreme Speed.



Usage Tips
========

    You may need to predict switch ins with Taunt or Toxic. However, since this set is designed to be bulky, you'll find yourself switching in often, so you have a lot of chances to punish.
    Don't try to stall out special attackers with this set, unless you know that they'll be doing less than 50%.
    Avoid getting Toxiced as it completely kills your stalling ability.
    Relatively straightforward set


Team Options
========

    As a designated counter to certain Pokemon, it is best that you don't build your team around this Yveltal. Rather, you should fit Yveltal in based on your team's needs. Need a Ghost resist? Extremekiller giving you trouble? Throw this in.
    A cleric such as Xerneas or Blissey are decent partners to help remove surprise status conditions that can fatally ruin this set.



Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Oblivion Wing
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Foul Play / Hurricane
move 4: U-turn / Toxic / Focus Blast
ability: Dark Aura
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Modest
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    Oblivion Wing grants it a longer lifespan than most Scarfers.
    Dark Pulse is pretty spammable and can flinch your way to victory (hi there Melee_Mewtwo)
    Foul Play can revenge kill high attack targets such as Swords Dance Groundceus and Ghostceus
    U-turn can scout for things but don’t expect it to hurt. Toxic can catch certain enemies by surprise.


Set Details
========

    Modest nature is recommended Scarf Yveltal isn’t particularly strong and appreciates the extra power. Yveltal still outruns most of the relevant scarfers without the +Speed.
    Faster than +1 base 90s and 95s, and Speed ties with Scarf Genesect if you go Timid. Can revenge kill DDRay.
    Revenge kills all Mewtwo formes.
    Spammable moves in Dark Pulse and Oblivion Wing means it is not very easily punishable.


Usage Tips
========

    If your team needs a Ghost-resisting Scarfer that can take on Mewtwo, SD Groundceus, and Rayquaza, Scarf Yveltal can work for you.
    Spammable moves makes it a solid cleaner, so look for the lategame.


Team Options
========

    Don’t build around Scarf Yveltal – bring Scarf Yveltal based on your team’s needs.
    Nothing really different from the earlier sets.


Other Options
########

    Substitute / Disable can cause a lot of headaches. Substitute in general can synergize with Sucker Punch and Oblivion Wing, so it’s not a bad pickup on the mixed set.
    Assault Vest is a viable pickup for Yveltal as it has the power and bulk for it. Furthermore, it can sustain with Oblivion Wing. You do lose the ability to Taunt, however.
    Weakness Policy can be very frightening if successfully pulled off. Yveltal is probably one of the best Pokemon in the game at using this item due to its high stats, recovery from Oblivion Wing, and the ability to destroy Scarfers with Sucker Punch.
    Choice Specs Yveltal deals a lot of damage (its Dark Pulse is roughly as strong as that of +2 Darkrai), but not being able to Sucker Punch freely hurts this set somewhat. It can however potentially 2HKO Ho-Oh with Dark Pulse.
    A Specially Defensive version of the tank set is viable. Instead of specifically checking certain threats, it aims to use the combination of its special bulk and Foul Play to form a sturdy, general wall.
    Steel Wing dumpsters Carbink.



Checks & Counters
########

    Fairyceus, Clefable, physically defensive Ho-Oh and Xerneas are probably your best counters, but they all despise Toxic. Refresh Fairy Arceus and Clefable hardcounter Yveltal.
    Tyranitar destroys it if it lacks Focus Blast.
    Zekrom and Kyurem-W can hit it with SE STABs but keep in mind that Dark Pulse and Sucker Punch will hurt.
    Specsogre kills defensive Yveltal.
