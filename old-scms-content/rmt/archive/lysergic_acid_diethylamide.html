<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I'm not one to ladder too much, I mainly get on to mod the server and to pass time, I will do a few matches, and then one day I decided to check my ladder ranking and that's when I realized...."Hey, I am actually pretty high up on the ladder". I'm still rising on the ladder with this team, but decided that I would go ahead and post this. </p>

<p>(this team is offensive, with obviously fragile pokemon. Aside from adding toxic spikes to aide Lilligant, it's hard to find a replacement. Don't be like "omg weak to stall", "omg weak to dragon", etc. I'll just have your post removed)</p>

<p>impress. It's very easy to gain a sweep using Lilligant. I am making this RMT to showcase a fun offense Sun team that is different from a lot of the others, and to showcase a different type of synergy used with such a fragile team.</p>

<p>Much like my Rain Offense team, despite having some defensive motives, this shares the same goal. Get quick kills, or put my team in the position to where I can sweep with one of my two set up sweepers. Of course the team has it's weaknesses, but every team does, and each threat can be played around.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/38.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Ninetales</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Drought<br />
EVs: 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Roar<br />
- Flamethrower</p>

<p>Honestly, Ninetales is terrible. I only use this set for a couple of reasons. It's good for breaking up sub hydra's, it's good for getting status on Tyranitar switch ins, which is important because this team revolves around getting Hydreigon and Lilligant set up. It also succeeds in roaring lead Dragonite's who think a simple set up is easy, as well as Volcaronas. HP Fighting is there because more often then not, Heatrans like to come in and Heatran can be a pain to my team, ergo, the residual damage really helps as well as breaking Air Balloon if they decide to carry it. This team doesn't use a spinner, and I don't find Ninetale's role too important, but he's good to have so the opponent can focus on getting rid of him while I try and cripple their team not worrying if it dies or not. I use it more as bait, with the secondary goal of getting sun up. I normally win the match if it's against a no weather team.</p>

<p><strong>Terrakion</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Justified<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Stone Edge<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- X-Scissor<br />
- Quick Attack</p>

<p>There isn't much to say about Terrakion that hasn't ever been said previously. The goal of Terrakion in this team is simple, it provides the offensive power that I need in order to garner a lot of necessary sweeps. It helps break down Skarmary and Gliscor, and it's my main answer to Blissey. His role for this team serves more as "send him in and spam attacks, and sweep with my set-up mons later". I am contemplating Adamant due to the fact that sometimes Stone Edge and Close Combat just can't get the job quite done. Terrakion is also an excellent switch in to a plethora of common pokes used, as well as being a great pokemon to double switch with.</p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 20 Def / 236 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Lava Plume<br />
- Protect<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Toxic</p>

<p>If a pokemon were to be removed from my team, Heatran would be the first pokemon I would remove. However, its role is too important. Heatran is my answer to Latios/Latias, as well as switch ins to Outrages. Toxic is important for this guy, (and you will notice I rely a lot on Toxic for this team) due to the fact that I can Toxic things such as Dragonite and simply stall them out. This allows for Lilligant to sweep later. Forretress would be a great addition to this team but it can't tank hits like Heatran, and doesn't have the correct bulk I need, or typing for that matter. Flamethrower is another option I am considering for this set; however, once in a while Burn is absolutely handy so it's not something to be overlooked. Stealth rock is also a necessity that I can't have without using Heatran, and is the basis for a plethora of the sweeps I gain.</p>

<p><strong>Gliscor</strong> @ Toxic Orb<br />
Ability: Poison Heal<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 36 Def / 220 Spe<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Protect<br />
- Toxic</p>

<p>Ahahha. That's what I think when I even start to think about this guy. I run enough speed to outspeed Rotom-W and adamant Lucarios. This allows me to sub/protect stall Hydro Pump until Rotom is useless against Gliscor. Being able to Toxic Stall the majority of the metagame is just too much fun, as well as PP stall. Xatu, Skarmory, and Gliscor are my only threats going into a match, so I try to eliminate those as quickly as possible. Air Balloon Heatran is also a threat, but easily taken care of for the most part. While I do lack a lot of necessary bulk, and because of that CB Terrakion CAN have a potential 2HKO on me, I have enough synergy with my team that I can normally play around Terrakion. Gliscor is an absolute must for this Sun Team and is a basis for crippling my opponent and garnering as much residual damage as possible until I can bring in my two clean up pokemon. </p>

<p><strong>Hydreigon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- Substitute</p>

<p>This is a set I came up with a little bit ago. Blue Star I believe ended up making an analysis, and I got the idea from IFM who was using Sub Hydreigon during World Cup, and he was using Surf with it in rain. I thought, why not use a Sub Hydreigon, but use it in Sun instead? This has honestly been one of the coolest mons I have ever used. If it gets under a Substitute, it more often then not gets a kill and it's very easy to get substitutes. With Tentacruel's without ice beam running around, and in sun, Rotom-W Hydro Pump can't even break the sub, it's easy to set up and start a sweep. While it can't necessarily OHKO a lot of the metagame, it 2HKO's the vast majority, and you don't even need timid for this guy. It's a basis for a lot of comebacks and sweeps I gain, in combination with smart playing. </p>

<p><strong>Lilligant</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Chlorophyll<br />
EVs: 72 Def / 252 SpA / 184 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Quiver Dance<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Hidden Power Fire</p>

<p>One of the most overlooked, and underrated pokemon of the 5th generation, Lilligant is simply brilliant. Alice came up with this spread, and this allows Lilligant to survive CB Scizor Bullet Punch after rocks and kill with HP Fire, as well as survive Mamoswine Ice Shards.</p>

<p>Lilligant is such a great pokemon due to how independent it can be. While many sweepers rely on Chlorophyll to get quick kills, Lilligant is the opposite. Lilligant is able to sweep under the Rain, Sand, Hail, or Sun and only uses Sun as a bonus for extra speed if you need a quick Quiver then and there. After 1QD in Sun, Lilligant KO's many common threats such as Terrakion, Ferrothorn, etc. Using Lilligant without Quiver Dance is dumb, don't do it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, this is just a very fun team for me to use and pass time with. I have other serious teams, but the pacing of this team matches my style and can catch a lot of people off guard. Of course it can lose, but it obviously wins most of the time. It's biggest threats being Expert Belt Landorus, Chansey, Gliscor, and Mamoswine. While common, they can all be played around and beaten, the synergy of this team really works well and is a lot more successful then one gives it credit for.</p>
