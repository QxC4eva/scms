<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to burn the target. If the user is frozen, using this move will thaw it out immediately.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Scald is an excellent new tool for any bulky Water-type in today's metagame. While Scald may not be quite as powerful as Surf, it still packs a punch especially in the rain. So why use Scald at all when Surf is available? The reason for this Scald's secondary effect: a 30% to burn the opponent. This allows many walls that are lacking in physical Defense, like Jellicent and Tentacruel, to wall physical attackers almost indefinitely. This is made even more helpful to keep some of the most powerful Pokemon in the metagame at bay, including Haxorus, Dragonite, Lucario, and Gyarados, who would normally have an easy time setting up against the aforementioned walls. While Scald does shine against physical attackers, it still deals important residual damage to special attackers or walls, allowing the Scald user to eventually stall out the target.</p>
