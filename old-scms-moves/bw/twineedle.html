[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and always hits twice unless the opponent is KOed by the first hit. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate twice, and this move can KO through Focus Sash and Sturdy. Each hit has a 20% chance to poison the target. This gives an overall chance to poison the target of 36%. If the first hit breaks a Substitute, the attack will continue to damage the target. Each hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. If the target holds a Tanga, Jaboca, or Enigma Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat both hits as a single attack, and Color Change will only activate on the second hit of the move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Twineedle is far too weak to use competitively, and is outclassed by stronger Bug-type moves, such as Megahorn and U-turn.</p>
