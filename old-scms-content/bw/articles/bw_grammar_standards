<p>This article is intended to facilitate the correction and spell checking of all articles that go on site. This list is not exhaustive and is subject to change at any time. Updates are regularly made based on discussion in <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3390265#post3390265">the Spelling and Grammar Standards Thread</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="spell">Spelling</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Pokemon should be spelled without the accent.</li>
<li>The nature Naive should be spelled without the diaeresis (which looks like this: ï ).</li>
	<li>The phrase "super effective" is neither hyphenated nor capitalized.</li>
	<li>The phrases "revenge KO" and "revenge kill" are never hyphenated.</li>
	<li>When a type name is directly followed by the word "type", a hyphen is used (<em>Normal<strong>-type</strong></em>).</li>
	<li>When saying that a Pokemon has "some typing", it is never hyphenated (<em>Gengar's Ghost typing helps it be viable in OU.</em>).</li>
<li>Dealing with dual typings is a bit tricker. When a dual type name is directly followed by the word "type," a hyphen should not be used (<em>Rock / Ground type</em>). When saying that a Pokemon has "some dual typing," it is never hyphenated as well (<em>Golem's Rock / Ground typing was a godsend in RBY OU.</em>).</li>
	<li>Always spell out the full name of an item, never use abbreviations (<em>Life Orb is a powerful item on Gengar.</em>).</li>
	<li>Always spell out the full name of a stat (<em>Salamence should always run 252 Speed EVs.</em>). The only exception is when used in a full EV spread or in damage calculations (<em>An alternative spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD is viable with a Bold nature.</em>).</li>
	<li>Always use spaces in between the slash and numerical investment for EV spreads (<em>Physical attackers should run a 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe EV spread.</em>).</li>
	<li>Rotom and Deoxys <strong>formes</strong>, not forms.</li>
        <li>The standards for forme names are as follows: Wormadam-G, Wormadam-S, Shaymin-S, Deoxys-S, Deoxys-A, Deoxys-D, Giratina-O, and Rotom-A (where A is C for the lawn mower, H for the toaster, W for the washer, F for the refrigerator, S for the fan, and A for the five formes at large).</li>
<li>Speed tie, not Speed-tie or Speed Tie.</li>
	<li>Use "switch-in" when referring to a Pokemon that often switches in on another (<em>Scizor is a common <strong>switch-in</strong> to Latias.</em>).</li>
	<li>Do not use a hyphen when using "switch in" as a verb (<em>Gyarados can switch in on Mamoswine.</em>).</li>
	<li>Use "Uber" when referring to the Uber tier, but "Ubers" is acceptable when referring to the Ubers metagame.</li>
	<li>Use the ASCII ( ' ) apostrophe in writing, not the curly ( ’ ) apostrophe.</li>
	<li>Use the ASCII ( " ) quotation marks in writing, not the curly ( “ ” ) quotation marks. The curly apostrophes and quotation marks arise in using a word processor such as Microsoft Word. It is easiest to use a plain text editor such as Notepad, or the vBulletin text boxes.</li>
	<li>When referring to the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk, use RestTalk. This also goes for other accepted move combinations, including BoltBeam, VoltTurn, SubSeed, and EdgeQuake. These combinations should not be reversed; QuakeEdge is not OK.</li>
<li>When setup is being used as an adjective, spell it as setup and not set-up.(<em>Pichu is setup bait for Mewtwo.</em>) The verb form, to set up, is spelled as such.(<em>Mewtwo can set up on Pichu.</em>)</li>
	<li>When using one of the below-endorsed abbreviations, never use the non-abbreviated phrase.</li>
	<li>Do not refer to Latias and Latios together as "Lati@s".</li>
<li>The company is called Game Freak, not Gamefreak or GameFreak.</li>
<li>The item is called Flying Gem, not Flight Gem.</li>
<li>The item is called Fighting Gem, not Fight Gem.</li>
<li>The item is called Eviolite, not Evolution Stone.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="abb">Abbreviations</a></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Use 2v2 as an abbreviation for the double battle metagame.</li>
	<li>Use 3v3 as an abbreviation for the triple battle metagame.</li>
<li>Use VGC as an abbreviation for the Video Game Championships.</li>
	<li>Use RBY as an abbreviation for the Red / Blue / Yellow generation.</li>
	<li>Use GSC as an abbreviation for the Gold / Silver / Crystal generation.</li>
	<li>Use ADV as an abbreviation for the Advance Ruby / Sapphire / Emerald generation.</li>
	<li>Use DPP as an abbreviation for the Diamond / Pearl / Platinum generation.</li>
	<li>Use BW as an abbreviation for the Black / White / Black 2 / White 2 generation.</li>
	<li>Use OHKO as an abbreviation for one-hit knock-out.</li>
	<li>Use NHKO as an abbreviation for an N-hit knock-out, where N is any number greater than 1 (<em>Choice Band Gyarados can cleanly 2HKO even bulky Rotom-W.</em>).</li>
</ul>

<li>In RBY analyses, it is permissible to use the term sleeper, which is accepted as meaning "a Pokemon that induces sleep onto the opponent".</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="gram">Grammar</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Smogon uses the serial comma (the comma before "and" in a list). (<em>I went to the store with Bob, Jane<strong>,</strong> and Mike.</em>).</li>
<li>Commas should not be used to separate a compound verb unless the conjunction is combining two independent clauses or the comma is necessary for clarity.(<em>Pichu walked into the store and bought a pie</em>).</li>
	<li>Use active voice (<em>Gliscor can OHKO Magnezone.</em>) whenever possible rather than passive voice (<em>Magnezone can be OHKOed by Gliscor.</em>).</li>
<li>When writing a fraction, add a hyphen between the numerator and the denominator if both are written out rather than numerical. (<em>Pichu ate two-thirds of the pie.</em>)</li>
<li>Do not put a hyphen between an adverb and a noun. (<em>Pichu can use a <strong>defensively oriented</strong> set or a <strong>specially based</strong> set.</em>)</li>
	<li>When written as a single object, even naturally plural items are treated as singular (<em>Leftovers is a good item choice on bulky Pokemon. Choice Specs is put to excellent use on Jolteon.</em>).</li>
        <li>For unbracketed asides, use the em dash (&mdash;) and no spaces (<em>Mareep<strong>&mdash;</strong>that is to say, the entire evolution family<strong>&mdash;</strong>is extremely cute.</em>).</li>
	<li>Hidden Power Type, not Hidden Power [Type].</li>
<li>The word "resists" is only to be used as a form of the infinitive "to resist" and never as a noun. (<em>"Flying-type resists such as Pichu are good Pokemon" is incorrect.</em>)</li>
<li>Swift Swim user, not Swift Swimmer.</li>
	<li>The plural of a Pokemon is identical to the singular of that Pokemon. One Blissey, two Blissey. Never two Blisseys.</li>
	<li>OHKOes as the verb form (<em>Salamence <strong>OHKOes</strong> Alakazam.</em>) and OHKOs as a plural noun (<em>Salamence scores many <strong>OHKOs</strong>.</em>). OHKOed is the past tense (<em>Salamence <strong>OHKOed</strong> Alakazam</em>).</li>
	<li>Always append 's to a noun when signifying a singular possessive (<em>Latia<strong>s's</strong> Soul Dew</em>) or plural possessive that doesn't end in s (<em>Lucario<strong>'s</strong> Swords Dance</em>), and simply a ' when signifying a plural possessive for a word that ends in s (<em>All Latio<strong>s'</strong> Draco Meteor</em>).</li>
	<li>When listing multiple types, use a hyphen after each type (<em>Water-, Flying-, and Normal-types</em>).</li>
	<li>When listing effectiveness of attacks, the number goes before the x (<em>Earthquake is <strong>2x</strong> super effective on Lucario. Ice Beam is <strong>4x</strong> super effective on Salamence.</em>).</li>
	<li>You may use the pronoun "who" instead of "which" or "that" and use "he" or "she" to refer to Pokemon as people if you so desire. It must be consistent for the entire article or analysis if this is done, however.</li>
<li>Do not write an analysis in a form that puts emphasis on changes by generation. This includes avoiding phrases such as "With the advent of BW...".</li>
	<li>When referring to the battler, use the pronoun "you". Do not use "you" to refer to a Pokemon.</li>
	<li>Smogon uses the American English spelling of words (<em>favor, minimized, maximized, etc.</em>).</li> 
	<li>It is "<strong>an</strong> OHKO", not "a OHKO" (pronounce it 'oh-aitch-kay-oh' and it will make sense).</li>
	<li>The past tense of "to EV" is "EVed".</li>
        <li>The word "spectrum" should never be used to describe the difference between physical and special offensive and defensive stats; "Infernape hits hard from both sides of the spectrum" should be rephrased to say "Infernape hits hard both physically and specially," or something similar.</li>
<li>Refer to the "Wi-Fi Clause" as "Team Preview."</li>
<li>Avoid using "crux" in your analysis unless you know what you are doing. 95% of the time, you will simply be adding useless filler like "X is the crux of this set", which does not provide the reader with any information of value.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="cap">Capitalization</a></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Stats (<em>Attack, Special Defense, etc.</em>) are capitalized.</li>
	<li>Pseudo stats (<em>accuracy, evasion</em>) are not capitalized.</li>
	<li>Types (<em>Fire-type, Water-type, etc.</em>) are capitalized.</li>
	<li>Status effects (<em>paralysis, sleep, etc.</em>) are not capitalized.</li>
	<li>Pseudo status effects (<em>confusion, etc.</em>) are not capitalized.</li>
	<li>"Berry" is always capitalized when talking about a pinch Berry, even when used without a specific name (<em>The suggested item is a Berry.</em>). If not talking about some kind of pinch Berry, then it should not be capitalized (<em>Pichu enjoys berries in its salad.</em>)</li>
	<li>"Ball" is always capitalized when talking about a Poke Ball of some sort, even when used without a specific name (<em>The Ball used for capture doesn't matter.</em>). If not talking about some kind of Poke Ball, then it should not be capitalized (<em>Pichu likes playing with a beach ball.</em>)</li>
<li>"Choice" in "Choice item" is always capitalized when talking about any non-specific Choice item, such as Choice Specs, Choice Scarf, and Choice Band. (<em>Tyranitar is an excellent user of Choice items.</em>)</li>
<li>"Orb" in "status Orb" is always capitalized when talking about any non-specific status Orb, such as Flame Orb and Toxic Orb. (<em>Swellow can activate its ability Guts through the use of a status Orb.</em>)</li>
	<li>Weather (<em>sun, rain, etc.</em>) is not capitalized.</li>
	<li>Conditions (<em>Gyarados was <strong>Thunderbolted</strong></em>.) are capitalized only when the entire move name is used (<em>Scizor <strong>passed</strong> Iron Defense to Skarmory. Scizor <strong>Baton Passed</strong> Iron Defense to Skarmory</em>.).</li>
	<li>Tiers (<em>Uber, Overused, Underused, etc.</em>) are capitalized.</li>
	<li>Community-created terms such as "Speed tier" are not capitalized beyond the normal conventions, but Nintendo-created terms such as "Base Power" are capitalized as they would be in-game.</li>
	<li>Set names are only capitalized in set titles, never in set comments (<em>If Arcanine is a specially defensive variant, it isn't OHKOed by Milotic's Surf.</em>).</li>
	<li>Pokemon roles (<em>sweeper, tank, special wall, etc.</em>) are not capitalized.</li>
	<li>Ho-Oh, not Ho-oh.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi, not WiFi, Wifi, or Wi-fi.</li>
	<li>The following applies for the capitalization of specific moves:
	<ul>
			<li>Any move or ability that is a single, 12-letter word consisting of two words appended with each other (<em>Thunderpunch, Dynamicpunch, etc.</em>) are written like so in DPP: ThunderPunch, DynamicPunch, etc.</li>
			<li>Other abilities or attacks that consist of two words but that fit the 12-letter restriction (<em>Sunny Day, Zen Headbutt, Mold Breaker, etc.</em>) are written with a space in between and with both words having an initial capital letter.</li>
			<li>All attacks having a dash (<em>Wake-Up Slap, X-Scissor, etc.</em>) are written with the word after the dash also capitalized. U-turn and V-create are the only exceptions to this rule.</li>
			<li>There are further exceptions to the first two rules. The following are the correct way of writing the particular word: BubbleBeam, Compoundeyes, DoubleSlap, Flamethrower, Lightningrod, Selfdestruct, SmokeScreen, Softboiled, SolarBeam, Superpower, Tailwind, Thunderbolt.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The word "physical" is not capitalized. The word "special" is not capitalized when not referring to a stat (<em>Azelf has 125 base <strong>Special</strong> Attack, but Flamethrower is a <strong>special</strong> attack.</em>). When saying something is "physically defensive" or "specially defensive", physical and special are not capitalized.</li>
	<li>The word "defenses" is not capitalized when referring to a Pokemon's overall defensive ability rather than to a stat (<em>Cresselia has exceptional balanced defenses.</em>).</li>
	<li>The word "Pokemon" is always capitalized.</li>
	<li>The word "nature" is not capitalized (<em>Adamant <strong>nature</strong>, not Adamant <strong>Nature</strong></em>).</li>
	<li>The word "suspect" is not capitalized when referring to a Pokemon (<em>Garchomp is a suspect.</em>), but it is capitalized when referring to the Suspect metagame or tier.</li> 
	<li>The word "bulky" is not capitalized when it prefixes a type (<em>bulky Water-type</em>).</li>
	<li>The phrase "critical hit" is not capitalized.</li>
	<li>The phrase "dual screens" is not capitalized.</li>
	<li>An exception to these is "SubSeed" which is proper when referring to both a set and the strategy of using Substitute in conjunction with Leech Seed.</li>
	<li>The word "Egg" is capitalized when referring to a Pokemon's Egg or Egg Groups.</li>
</ul>

<p>When in doubt, refer to in-game for proper spellings of moves, abilities, and other Nintendo terms.</p>

<h3><a name="ing">In-game</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>It is indeed in-game with the hyphen, not ingame or in game.</li>
<li>It's Pokédex, not PokéDex or Poké Dex</li>
<li>You should write Pokémon Center with the accent.</li> 
<li>Other Poké words: Poké Ball, Poké Flute, Poké Mart, etc.</li> 
<li>The standard we go by is Poké Dollars to describe the currency of the Pokemon games.</li>
<li>"Berry" is always capitalized when talking about a pinch Berry, even when used without a specific name (<em>The suggested item is a Berry.</em>). If not talking about some kind of pinch Berry, then it should not be capitalized (<em>Pichu enjoys berries in its salad.</em>)</li>
<li>"Ball" is always capitalized when talking about a Poke Ball of some sort, even when used without a specific name (<em>The Ball used for capture doesn't matter.</em>). If not talking about some kind of Poke Ball, then it should not be capitalized (<em>Pichu likes playing with a beach ball.</em>)</li> 
<li>"Egg" is always capitalized when talking about a Pokemon Egg of some sort. (<em>The Pokemon's Egg hatched!</em>) This also applies to Egg Groups. If not talking about a Pokemon's Egg, then it should not be capitalized (<em>Delibird is actually quite a fan of scrambled eggs.</em>)</li>
<li>Trainer is always capitalized when used in the context of a Pokemon Trainer.</li> 
<li>The correct capitalization and spelling is Exp. Points.</li>
<li>The "w" in wild Pokemon is never capitalized.</li> 
<li>Gym Leader is always capitalized.</li> 
<li>Gym is also always capitalized when talking about the Gym of the town where the Gym Leader resides that holds the Badge.</li>
<li>Badge is always capitalized as well.</li>
<li>The title of a Trainer is always capitalized; ie. Fisherman, Lass, Rocket Grunt, etc. However, when a Trainer class and a normal citizen have the same name, such as scientist, only capitalize those who are actually Trainers. (<em>I got the item from the Scientist that I battled.</em>) (<em>I talked to one of the scientists in Cinnabar Lab.</em>)</li>
<li>The "r" in route is only capitalized when used as a proper noun in conjunction with the route number, such as Route 1.</li>
<li>There is no space between the "TM" and the number of the TM, such as TM01. This is the same for HMs.</li>
</ul>
