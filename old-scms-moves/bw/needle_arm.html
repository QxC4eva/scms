<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There is almost no reason to use Needle Arm competitively, as it's outclassed by more powerful Grass-type moves, and despite a decent chance to flinch the opponent, this alone is not enough reason to use it instead of another more powerful options like Seed Bomb or Leaf Blade. So there is no recommend situation for using this move.</p>
