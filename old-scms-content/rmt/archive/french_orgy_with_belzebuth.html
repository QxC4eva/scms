<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/38.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Ninetales</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Drought<br />
EVs: 88 HP / 252 SpA / 168 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Solarbeam<br />
- Hidden Power Ice<br />
- Sunny Day</p>

<p>Ninetailes is one of the big winners in this 5th generation because he follows the example of Tyranitar. Indeed thanks to Drought he brings his own climate which is the sun when he comes into the field. Without him this team would not have been able to exist. Thus let us get straight to the point and let us analyze his set.</p>

<p>Ninetailes @Sunny day? WTF ? It is nevertheless complicated well. Ninetailes is the fastest weather inducer of the OU which means that in front of Politoed or Tyranitar, the sun will not be present. Another reason came to be added to it, indeed I had noticed that as soon as the opponent did not feel threatened by him and if he has the opportunity there, he will switch into his weather inducer. So as soon as Ninetailes was in the battlefield, I had the right for a switch on Politoed. After all, What was the risk for him to come? Ninetailes does not have much who could prevent Poli from coming on the field. It was the same for Tyra, only a burn could annoy him. And so came to me the idea of Sunny day. I place Ninetailes on a weak Pokémon to the fire and shall anticipate a future switch into Politoed / Tyra. From there ensue the attack Solar beam. I am assured to have the sun with me and I become dangerous with Ninetales. Indeed, who would like to take himself one Solar beam with a TSS or a RD when the opponent is in the incapacity to place his climate? Also, who would like to eat one Fire Blast under Sun+ the stab?</p>

<p>This set allows me then to put a not insignificant pressure to my opponent. It will be necessary for my opponent to switch because behind I have Dugtrio who allows me to end the opposite weather inducer. I just will have to anticipate the switch of my opponent and attack consequently. Finally for the last move I always left Hidden power Ice, please, that I not bad hesitated with Will-o-wisp. However seen the number of Haxorus and Nite @lum berry, PC Ice turned out much more effective.</p>

<p>Concerning the spread and the item, I had begun by playing him with the life orb and 252 in SAtk that allowed me to make of numerous OHKO with Freblast under Sun see of certain OHKO Rotom-W with Solarbeam. But my life decreased too fast and well the version with lefties did not prevent from putting the pressure I wished. I also tested him with 252 spd that allowed me to outspeed more Pokémons of whom Salamence being rarely played full speed in 5G but in the end it was better to have just of what to outspeed cheerful Excadrill without climate, knowing that of more Drattak is of played advantage Mix with a spread hurriedly lower than mine thus the problem is settled obvious 88 staying Evs goes to the HP.Some would have put them in special defense but well we are always brought to receive physical knocks of Ciza or I don't know who so > HP</p>

<p><strong>Thundurus</strong> @ Expert Belt<br />
Ability: Prankster<br />
EVs: 192 Atk / 64 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Hammer Arm<br />
- Hidden Power Ice<br />
- Thunderbolt</p>

<p>Well, I put him in second, but he is the last one Pokémon to have completed the team. It is not there to say " Hello I am too sturdy, a place in the team is missing invite me ! I am the special fill hole of this 5th generation! " Not, it is not really that. He even became almost irreplaceable in the team.</p>

<p>Here, nothing extraordinary, classic set or maybe not? It is very recent because I was playing the full SAtk version with lefties but after posting my RMT in a French forum someone suggest me this version which is really better for my team I guess. Note that Nasty plot was on the place of T-Wave a few weeks ago. Indeed, Nasty plot seemed to me really effective because ThunUber as we call him, had the capacity to be eatable team if this last one was not prepared. Having said that, as many Sun and the other teams, Terrakion is a big threat and Jirachi @T-Wave/Body slam/Thunder could be also very annoying with its paralyses almost free. I finally had the idea to put Thunder Wave on Thundurus mainly for these two amply sufficient reasons. Terrakion scarf outspeed Venusaur under sun and could thus make big damage in my team see it being made if Venusaur has already taken a blow and if SR was put so cancelling the sash of Dugtrio.As for the double dancer, not great easy to set up but not too hard either. T Wave might be the solution of this big problem because anyway I take out him only at the end of the match. Concerning Jirachi, once paralyzed he will be slower than all of my Pokémons so…</p>

<p>In brief, Thundurus is the Jocker of my team, my rescuer etc. He allows me to make good damages for the RD in case of pip and for the TSS so for the same reason, that is if I made a ball with Ninetailes. It is also with him that I lead if the match up of departure does not augur no good to me or if I am too hesitating but generally it is with Ninetales that I shall begin. </p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Air Balloon<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 104 Def / 124 SpA / 28 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Will-o-Wisp<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Magma Storm</p>

<p>What to say... My pride simply. Sometimes he disappoints me to make beauty misses but well 75 % of accuracy in not ugly. Quite a lot of persons think that it is normal to miss it while that has the same precision as Wow in 5G...</p>

<p>The role of this Pokémon? So many ! It is my stall breaker, his main role against a stall will be to take Bliss/Chancey and that will not be too much complicated. Heatran is a magnet to Bliss because it is supposed to do nothing to her and hurts hardly the other Pokémons of a stall team. Roughly we launch Magma Storm, we trap, we taunt and we end the family of the pink cows. During the first versions of my sun, his main goal was to Trap Tyranitar and to lure it because I was not playing Dugtrio, then Tyranitar did not feel threatened and came above...Now that I have Dugtrio, Tyra will be more complicated to trap seen that he will ceaselessly be afraid, but so well placed against a Gliscor, Natto or whatever under sun for example, Tyranitar's coming will be imminent if Magma Storm was not previously revealed.</p>

<p>Other big role of this monster is the " POLITOED'S Trap " . Magma Storm + Erthpower + 2 Erathquake of Dugtrio and I win my weather war. I know that I 'm gonna lose 2 Pokémons, I am aware of it but against a RD, if I have the sun, Pyrax is supposed to eat the rest of the team. Who can stop him then? It is the same even with SR on the oppenent's side. To do it, it is not well complicated, the majority of Drizzle team have a Latios. In 90 % of the cases and it is not a joke, here is how takes place the match if Toed wears Choice spe. I lead with Ninetailes, him with his Rotom-W or his Politoed. For Rotom-W, it is about mind game and the analysis of team ( Scarf or not?) I can go on Freblast or Sunny day. Concerning Politoed, it is simple, I launch Sunny day, he will go on Hydropump or Whatever and then I can go on Solar beam or predict the Switch into Latios . Heatran is only 3HKO by Tios spe. My balloon will be spotted once on the ground, then what would be afraid Politoed to come on heatran knowing that he has the balloon? So much put back the rain! I thus go on Magma storm and if it is not a miss = Bingo! The game is already over... </p>

<p>The last important role of this monster, the check of dragons. 252 Evs in HP and 104 in Def. Evs in defense allowed me at the beginning, to Hold 3 Super power of Tyranitar. More if I outspeed him and use Wow at first. That also allowed me to hold a Close combat of Tarrakion@ Ballon/Scarf without SR. I had recently hesitated to move these Evs of his defense. Until I play against Idiotfrommars for the world cup... He played an Infernape with expert Belt. He thought of having won the game when he placed it.Then I lauched Heatran and he throw obviously Close combat, my Hp comes down to the red, but that stops there and I revenge kill it with Earthpower. I took it as a "sign", because I had thought of moving them just 1 day before my match. And afterward I noticed that these Evs in defense served me for much more things. They allow me to be only 3HKO by Haxorus Bander, also for Dragonite. Whatever how Haxorus is I can deal with him even if it cost me 1 Pokémon. I can allow even not to use Will-o-wisp. Sometimes I shall need it and sometimes not. Ninetailes outspeed both and hurt then with HP Ice which is a 100 % of precision contrary to will-o-wisp. In brief, this Heatran is a pure Boss, it has a big role to play whatever the team of my oppenent is, he is the key of this team.</p>

<p>Concerning the spread in SAtk, I shall have liked having it a little more to make of very numerous additional OHKO. In particular on leads as Deoxys or under sun against Bulky Conkeldur, Reuniclus and some more. But finally he makes it already not bad, OHKO Scorvol under sun and quite a lot of others. I forgot a detail also mattering enough. The TSS with Hippodocus... If Tran doesn't miss Magma Storm at turn 1, then I won the game. What Else? Concerning speed, he has to outspeed Nite with T Wave/Substitute/dragon-tail/Roost who enormously pissed me off when I had no necessary speed for outspeed him. I need to burn him as quickly as possible to break his special capacity. That allows me besides outspeeding all Bulky Tran with roar + SR. It is only 28 Evs but they are so helpfull.</p>

<p><strong>Dugtrio</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Arena Trap<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Reversal</p>

<p>Ah! The Key² (dedication to Ro ² lool) of the team. Only this key opens roughly only 2 doors:d. Indeed, his role is limited to Trap. Either Tyra, or Politoed but also and "especially" Heatran who is the best Volcarona's counter if he has roar. His last role will be to put SR.</p>

<p>Concerning the set, nothing innovative or extraordinary. I'm actually testing the Adamant version. There is advantages and disavantages  I can't outspeed Tyra scarf and Terrakion + some Politoed scarf are play modest. So at this moment and for this team I'm using the jolly version.</p>

<p>Reversal replaced Stone edge and not sucker punch for some reasons I will take about later.Reversal helps me a lot in his trapping job because now I'm pretty sure that without SR I can kill weather inducer especially Toed if he is not 252 HP / 252 Def (or something similar) without SR.</p>

<p>Many do not play him with Sucker punch. This move is nevertheless very useful. He allows to finish certainly very damaged Pokémon. And for nothing in the world I shall remove this move for the threat that Reuniclus TR is. Venusaur does like 70 % with Solar beam. Then what? He finishes all other Sun teams because you have nothing to take him down? "Damn it, that was so close ! ". It is not my case at all because I can finish him with Sucka punch ! No it is not only for Reuniclus. Suckerpunch + solarbeam from Venu Kill Landorus which is one of the biggest threat for the team + some more reasons... ( Stone edge helps for Thundurus, Tornadus and Nite and that's all but I prefer using SP.)</p>

<p>In brief, I have nothing more to said on him, he makes an excellent duet with my heatran = double trapper, it is rather enormous as combo especially when we know the impact that has the climate on the match. Thus yes, I am rather proud of this combo. Oh I forgot about focus sash ! It works very well with Reversal in order to One shot Tyra, then I can put SR + reversal against him. It allows me to take car about Toed too ( thinking more particularly about the Choice Specs version).</p>

<p><strong>Venusaur</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Chlorophyll<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Sunny Day<br />
- Sleep Powder<br />
- Solarbeam<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>Venusaur... Welcome here in my world :d When everybody plays him with growth I play him with Sunny day not to say " hello kikoo" but by the fact that the whole team wants him to have it. Rather than to be the finisher it is the pillar of the team, the MOST important one. It is mainly around him whom the team turns and not with Ninetales as we could think of it, Ninetales is important of course but it has for role to entice and to weaken the opposite team. Once died, the opponent will feel safe while it is not the case thanks to Venusaur.</p>

<p>Let's go for the explanation of the set:</p>

<p>We are going to begin with the spread. Very classic but non exchangeable, I need the max speed for the others Venu but also because otherwise Deoxys-S outspeed me down from its 504 of speed  concerning Evs in attack spe, I need the big power of Solar beam to hurt, it is only for that because Hidden Power Fire is an OHKO for "nobody" under Sun (apart Scizor). Yes, he does not kill Nattorei, Excadrill, Zone, Jirachi or the others. That is why many Venusaur is played with the Life orbe. This item is very profitable increasing considerably the number of OHKO. But he is not in my team for that. He is here to sweep for sure but not to beat the oppenent's team alone, he is there to give a second soufle / allocate to the team once Ninetales in trouble or KO. Quite as Ninetales, not a lot Pokémons are able to take a Solar beam or an Hidden power Fire having 105 of power thanks to the sun. It is a nightmare for my opponents because resistant Pokémons in his two attacks will be "put to sleep" with Sleep Powder. Yes " put to sleep" is between quotation mark because is added there another move to 75 % of accurency, brilliant move but which wants almost never worked! It is partially for that that I lost my matches of the World Cup . But 75 % of accurency, if we analyze, it is pretty good,No? I don't know... That must not be sufficient for Pokémon xd. In brief when it works it is tremendously good in any case. Roughly, Venusaur works as Ninetales, we anticipate the opposite weather inducer if not died, and so has more ben of it there... We sweep, one prepare at best the battlefield for Volcarona or conversely according to the situation. Yes I am going to contradict myself but Venusaur besides being the pillar of my team is also and often the finisher and nevertheless it goes out in the middle of the game for the reasons evoked higher. Leftovers offer him an excellent staying power especially with the numerous switchs which he is going to create and attacks like Protect used by my opponent as For Gliscor for example. He takes approximately 70 % on Solar beam, that often terrifying him because I take even not 50 % on Ice fang.</p>

<p>Finally well, it is an excellent Pokémon, horror for many of teams, horror who is perfectly well surrounded. I shall add however that he is the only Pokémon allowing me to handle the biggest weakness of my team, namely Landorus scarf. Terrible on paper but completely manageable with the experience and skill.</p>

<p><strong>Volcarona</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flame Body<br />
EVs: 144 HP / 84 Def / 120 SpA / 160 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Quiver Dance<br />
- Morning Sun<br />
- Bug Buzz</p>

<p>Finally! My big very favorite of this 5th generation. According to me, this Pokémon should being Uber. I have already vaguely speak about him to some of you but this Pokémon is a real devil Oo. He is capable of set up on many Pokémon, and by on whatever! He can on Pokémons which we find in the top 20 of the biggest uses. He has a really enormous special defense, a special attack rather high and a quite good speed. Add the new present of the 5G aka Quiver Dance increasing by a level your special attack, special defense and speed. Of type fire and also and especially Bug which is really welcome in my team. </p>

<p>Let's go for the more in-depth analysis:</p>

<p>Hum...What I have to begin with? The Spread! I am also the author of the spread of this Volcarona after numerous calculations. First of all, the speed. Why I'm playing him timid with 160 Evs hurriedly? Simply to outspeed Excadrill without weather or under sun. It is very important because Exca is a late game sweeper and because at this stage of the game if the opponent is good, I shall have roughly Volcarona and Venusaur. I know that the SS will not be any more on the ground and sunny day lasts only 5 Turns. I thus needed this necessary and vital speed for outspeed one of the most dangerous sweepers of the game.</p>

<p>Later, that complicates. I have no spinner and Volcarona is supposed to be my finisher.A Pokémon beginning with 50 % of his life,hum...Not very good. That's why I needed a minimum of Bulk and also power. Who says Sun says Morning Sun = 66 % of recovery . It is the first thing of which I thought. Then needed me a mix completed between Pvs, defense and special attack. I thus put myself in situations lived with the numerous matches which I was able to make. Roughly, I gathered all the pains in the ass who could be annoying for my Volcarona and I began to make full of calculations. Weaknesses of Volca? The poison, paralysis, Trickers and the RK with in head Tyra scarf.</p>

<p>For the poison, I thought of Gliscor, if the opponent did not send him and if I am not still sure to have win, I am not going to set up and taking risks, I have to kill it with Fireblast under sun with my special spread> 98,59 116 % mission complete. For trickers, it is simple, I saw only Rotom. I thus needed the OHKO at + 1 with Bug Buzz and SR (yes because without SR, stop dreaming !) > 80,58 - 95,45 %. Roughly it is a 50% chance to prop up him. It is playable and then, according to what stays to my opponent I can set up during one more turn seen that the scarf do not outspeed me at + 1. Concerning Tyra scarf > 80,7 95,61 % it is similar as Rotom, it will have been eatable at least a first attack of the style of Fireblast from Ninetailes. Roughly, completed.</p>

<p>Well later had the other numerous stages with HP / def there and returned to the special attack. I had at +1 and under sun to be capable of 2HKO Blissey who would like to come on Volcarona. Take care, It hurts !! > 44,68- 52,66 %. 2HKO with SR thus (by counting lefties). In brief, I managed at these a 50 % chances to kill all these important Pokémons.</p>

<p>Concerning HP and defense. Fiou, were needed calculations too. I wanted to be able to take place on Ciza Bander with SR on the battlefield. With this spread I lose between 100 and 113 HP on a BP from the bander and something like 43% on Quick attack. Roughly having taken SR I do Morning Sun and I can play in Peace. Priority was absolved, I have to contain a Double Edge from Sawsbuck with LO. I hold it 100 % (without SR because thanks to Heatran, the other sunny will have much more evil to place them, I thus have a rather big advantage with my team made:d). In 50 % needed me so enough HP to hold attacks like Hydropump from Rotom-W under sun. I hold with 50 % of luck one Hydropump from the Choice spe. I 'm talking here, of if I had to take place on him because then I can use Morning sun outspeeding him. Otherwhise I can dance in front of him. I hold otherwise any Hydropump from Rotom with 50 % under sun. It was also necessary to me to be able to make something in front of Latios Spe in case of pip.With SR and so with 50% of his life, he has a 50 % of chance to tank a DM from Tios spe at -2. Otherwise ben he has a 66 % of chance of OHKO me without SR, but if I come, it is when he is at -2 and what in case of big pip. If he does not kill me, it is GG, I dance, look after myself and life is beautiful.</p>

<p>Then some people will say that all of this is very approximate. Yes it is not false,but at least, my Vlcarona can manage in numerous different situations. All these explanations I hope for it, will avoid recommendations of the style "use flamethrower, it is more precise" or I do not know what. There are many ways of playing the Butterfly. Mine is just perfect for my team, he does what I ask him. If I miss Fire blast, it is not my fault, it is pokémon:d.</p>

<p>Finally well, he really does some good work and could obtain the rank of Uber seen the threat he represents for so many team. Furthermore, if Excadrill must be banished, there I shall passed him modest and omg omg omgl!!! XD</p>
