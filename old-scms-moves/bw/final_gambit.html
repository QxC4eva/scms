<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user faints. The target loses HP equal to the amount lost by the user. Can break Substitutes. Fails against Protect or Detect.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>We're all still mourning the death of Explosion from the transition from DPP to BW, but Final Gambit helps ease these woes just a tad. If you decide on using Final Gambit, keep your user's HP as high as possible—perhaps with Rapid Spin support—and make sure they can outrun a large majority of common threats. Final Gambit users also make good leads as they can net a quick KO on a troublesome foe or leave a bulky wall in deep trouble. Good users of this move include RU's Accelgor, who can blaze past and quickly KO just about any switch-in, as well as UU's Choice Scarf Victini.</p>
