[Overview]

<p>Banette just might be the creepiest-looking Pokemon. Don't be fooled by that sinister appearance, though; his stats leave much to be desired. While his only usable looking stat appears to be his base 115 Attack, his frailty and low Speed make him a poor choice for a sweeper. He does, however, have just the right moves to make a support set worthwhile. Those terrible defenses, coupled with his laughable Speed, actually make him a perfect candidate for the role of a suicide Trick Room lead. Just don't expect this monstrosity to accomplish much else.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The basic premise of this set is to set up Trick Room while your opponent attacks, leaving Banette with just 1 HP thanks to Focus Sash. Next, use Destiny Bond as the opponent attacks again, killing both Pokemon and giving one of your Trick Room sweepers 3 turns to dish out damage. Taunt forces the opponent to attack Banette instead of just setting up themselves. Curse is useful for killing Banette off should your opponent refuse to finish the job, but instead keeps switching to stall out Trick Room turns and avoid attacking in order to dodge Destiny Bond.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>By minimizing Speed, Banette becomes as fast as possible under Trick Room. The complete lack of defensive investment ensures he will be KOed by almost any attack. Focus Sash is the item of choice to guarantee Banette survives the first attack. Mental Herb is an option, however, to prevent Banette from being Taunted. When using Mental Herb, maximum HP and some defensive investment is recommended. Shadow Claw is an option over Curse to give Banette a chance to utilize that base 115 Attack; when using this, 252 Attack EVs are recommended. If you choose to forgo Shadow Claw or Mental Herb, Banette can be reduced to just level 1 to further minimize its Speed and defenses. Insomnia is the ability of choice, guaranteeing Banette won't be put to sleep.</p>

<p>The best teammates for this set are powerful but slow Trick Room sweepers. Marowak, Aggron, and Druddigon immediately spring to mind as great candidates for this task. Clamperl is another great Trick Room sweeper, and due to its poor defenses, needs the free switch-in that Banette provides. As this set is meant for use only on dedicated Trick Room teams, and because Banette won't live to set it up a second time, other bulkier Trick Room users are of course recommended. The likes of Uxie and Slowking are solid choices for this role.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Banette's offensive movepool isn't the greatest; Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak are its best bets for a straight attacking set, as it will be too slow to hit anything otherwise. Will-O-Wisp, Disable, Torment, and Pain Split are all great support moves, but there are bulkier Ghost-types, such as Rotom or Spiritomb, that can pull such sets off better. Banette can run a similar set to the one listed above using Rain Dance or Sunny Day in place of Trick Room, but without the pseudo-Speed boost provided by Trick Room, it will likely be too slow to successfully use Destiny Bond. Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Swagger are great moves, but once again, there are plenty of Pokemon that can use them much more effectively.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything with a faster Taunt than Banette will easily shut it down if it lacks Mental Herb. Whimsicott in particular is great in this role, as it gets a priority Taunt and can use it first even under Trick Room. Any phazing move, such as Roar or Whirlwind, will move before Trick Room and force Banette out. Should any entry hazards be set up before he makes a return, Focus Sash will fail to work and his entire set falls apart. Any multi-hit move, such as Klinklang's Gear Grind, will bypass Focus Sash and easily finish off the frail Banette before it can even use Trick Room. Finally, priority in the form of Shadow Sneak—from Gallade and Dusknoir—can kill off Banette before he can use Destiny Bond, though it will not prevent Trick Room from being set up.</p>
