[SHORT DESC]
Prevents the last move used from being used again for 4-7 turns.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Prevents the last move the target used from being used again for 4-7 turns. Only one move per target can be Disabled. Disable fails if the target has not used a move since it has switched in, if the target tried and failed to use a move this turn (due to sleep, paralysis, recharging, etc) before being targeted with Disable, or if the target's last used move has 0 PP remaining. The target does nothing if the move it was about to use is Disabled that turn.
