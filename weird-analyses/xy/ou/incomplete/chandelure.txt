########

Chandelure was built for instant offense. With a monstrous base 145 Special Attack backed up by superb offensive STABs in Fire and Ghost, alongside good abilities in Flash Fire and Infiltrator, it is not lacking in damage dealing potential. However, look past that glossy exterior and you'll find a Pokemon with flaws that saw it relegated to UU last generation - mediocre base speed, a vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards, and a poor defensive typing. But whilst Chandelure has not changed much in the transition to Generation VI, the metagame has, and it is kinder to the Luring Pokemon. The buff to Defog makes keeping hazards of the field much easier than before, its Ghost STAB is easier to spam than ever, and it has a new potential teammate in Charizard Y to bring its beloved sun to the party. So if you're looking for some real offensive presence right from the word go, look no further than Chandelure.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Energy Ball
move 4: Trick / Memento
ability: Flash Fire / Infiltrator
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 Def / 252 SAtk / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

One of Chandelure's biggest weaknesses has always been its subpar Speed, so a Choice Scarf is a great item for it, turning it into a decent revenge killer. Shadow Ball and Fire Blast are your mandatory STAB attacks - the former is the easiest to spam as it has few resists in OU, but the latter is much more powerful, especially under the sun or with a Flash Fire boost. Energy Ball allows you to hit bulky Water-types for super effective damage on the switch as they don't mind switching into Fire Blast. The final slot is your utility move - Trick is always great on a Choiced Pokemon to cripple defensive swtich-ins, but Memento is an equally useful option (when Chandelure is no longer needed) to give your setup sweepers a little breathing space to boost and go for the win.

There is a bit of room for customisation on this set. A Hidden Power of choice can be used to deal with specific threats and can go in the third or fourth moveslot. Hidden Power Ground hits defensive Heatran, HP Fighting gives you a weapon against Tyranitar, HP Ice helps Chandelure revenge kill 4x weak Dragons, and HP Rock decimates Charizard Y. Pick the option that best covers your team's weaknesses.


Set Details
========

Scarf Chandelure should always run maximum Speed and Special Attack with a Timid Nature. With this investment it can outspeed most of the common unboosted Pokemon in OU, as well as the rather dangerous +1 Adamant Dragonite and Gyarados. Flash Fire and Infiltrator are both usable abilities - the former makes switching Chandelure in a little easier and can give this set a much needed power boost. Infiltrator gives Chandelure the somewhat rare ability to revenge kill foes behind a Substitute, which can potentially stop a threat from sweeping or punching huge holes in your team. However, it is incompatible with Trick.

Usage Tips
========

One of the main selling points of Scarf Chandelure is its naturally high Special Attack which means it can hit hard without a boosting item. This gives it greater revenge killing potential and also means it can clean up a weakened team more easily with one of its excellent offensive STABs. With good prediction it can be used as an offensive spinblocker in a pinch, switching into Rapid Spin and threatening the spinner with its powerful moves. It should also be noted that Scarf Chandelure is excellent against Mega Charizard Y, which is a prominent threat in the metagame. It's immune to Fire Blast and Focus Blast, resists SolarBeam and does not take much from any other move other than Earthquake which fails to OHKO after Stealth Rock. Meanwhile Shadow Ball 2HKO's with a small amount of prior damage.

Team Options
========

Rapid Spin or Defog support is a must, as Chandelure's inability to switch moves means it will be switching out often, and it will die very quickly should hazards be on the field. Mega Blastoise, Exacdrill and Forretress are all good options, the former softening up many of Chandelure's checks whilst the latter two bait Fire attacks for it to switch into. A teammate who can deal with Chandelure's nemesis Tyranitar is helpful, since it cannot leave a scratch on him without HP Fighting and even that can't touch defensive variants. Finally, Drought support from Ninetales or Charizard Y gives this Chandelure a much needed power boost.

SubSplit
########
name: SubSplit
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Pain Split
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Fire Blast
ability: Flash Fire
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
evs: 4 Def / 252 SAtk / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

Substitute is a neat tool for Chandelure, blocking status moves and the dangerous Pursuit to ease the need for prediction. Whilst behind the Substitute, Chandelure can fire off a powerful STAB Shadow Ball or Fire Blast. The final part of the puzzle is Pain Split, which gives Chandelure a method of wearing down its checks whilst simultaneously healing the passive damage caused by its use of Substitute and Life Orb.

Your alternative options on this set are Flamethrower and Hidden Power Fighting. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for its superior PP and accuracy - however the significant decrease in power means missing out on certain important KO's on foes like Gliscor and Naive Landorus-T. Hidden Power Fighting provides perfect type coverage with Shadow Ball and 2HKOes offensive variants of Tyranitar, but is relatively weak.

Set Details
========

A Modest nature with maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed is the only spread this set should run, for maximum power with Life Orb. Timid is an option, but Chandelure doesn't outspeed anything notable with it bar the odd Adamant Mamoswine. Speed investment ensures defensive foes switching in on an attack can't hit Chandelure with a status move before it can use Substitute to block it. If you want Chandelure to be a little harder to kill, Leftovers provides passive recovery and means that you aren't completely reliant on Pain Split to stay healthy. However, Life Orb's power boost is generally superior.

Usage Tips
========

Chandelure threatens quite a few notable defensive Pokemon, most of them Steel-type like Ferrothorn and Skarmory. If you can switch in on them, you can grab a free Substitute as they switch out and hit whatever comes in with the move of your choice, be it a direct attack or Pain Split. Even better targets are Fire-type attacks, which will give Chandelure a Flash Fire boost and increase its destructive capacity.
SubSplit is also good at putting faster, normally solid checks to Chandelure in a difficult position. Terrakion in the sand is a prime example; normally it would switch into Fire Blast and take little damage whilst threatening to OHKO with a Rock-type move, but after switching into Substitute it risks being stripped of 50% of its health by Shadow Ball. This means that next time Chandelure comes in, Terrakion cannot check it effectively, giving your opponent fewer options.
Whilst this Chandelure is less vulnerable to hazards thanks to Pain Split, its average defences mean that swtiching into even a neutral attack with hazards up can seal Chandelure's fate. Be wary of this, and try to switch Chandelure into only attacks it is resistant or immune to.


Team Options
========

Because this Chandelure has a method of recovery in Pain Split, Rapid Spin and Defog support is less necessary to it than it is to the Choice sets; however it is still greatly appreciated. Excadrill, Forretress and Scizor can all remove hazards and bait Fire-type attacks for Chandelure to switch into. Teammates that can set entry hazards are also important to help Chandelure turn a few 3HKOs into 2HKOs and 2HKOs into OHKOs. Ferrothorn is a good choice for its defensive synergy - it resists Chandelure's Water and Rock-type weaknesses, and baits Fire-type attacks. Finally, special attackers with similar checks pair well with Chandelure.


Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Energy Ball
move 4: Trick / Hidden Power Ground
ability: Flash Fire / Infiltrator
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 Def / 252 SAtk / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

Choice Specs turns Chandelure's high base power Fire-type STAB move into a monstrous attack, taking huge chunks out of even resistant foes, especially with a Flash Fire or sun boost. You have two options here: Fire Blast and Overheat. Fire Blast is less powerful and accurate but does not have the horrible Special Attack dropping side-effect of Overheat, so it is generally the better option. Shadow Ball is a great backup STAB move, and given the limited number of Ghost-resistant Pokemon in OU, it is very easy to spam.
Energy Ball rounds out your coverage, hitting bulky Water-types for good damage including an OHKO on non-Specially defensive Rotom-W, and dealing acceptable damage to Tyranitar. Finally, Trick cripples troublesome walls such as Blissey and Heatran on the switch.
If you want to eliminate particular threats, a Hidden Power of choice can be used over Trick or Energy Ball. Hidden Power Ground is listed as it obliterates Specially defensive Heatran, one of Chandelure's best switch-ins. Hidden Power Fighting is a good option for Tyranitar, 2HKOing all variants bar Assault Vest. Finally, if you really hate missing, Flamethrower can be used as your Fire-type STAB move, but the drop in power is very noticeable.


Set Details
========

A Modest Nature and maximum Special Attack investment maximises the benefits of Choice Specs. Max speed allows you to tie with Adamant Mamoswine and outspeed everything below that. Timid is an option to outspeed neutral base 80's but the power drop is significant. Flash Fire is the preferred ability as it provides you with more opportunities to switch Chandelure in, but Infiltrator lets Chandelure blast through slower Substitute users if you don't mind the loss of Trick.


Usage Tips
========

Chandelure can switch into many popular defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory and immediately threaten them out. From there you can punch holes in the opponent's team by predicting the switch-in and hitting it with the appropriate move. If you can get Chandelure into the action whilst the sun is up or if you can nab a Flash Fire boost, Chandelure's Fire Blast becomes incredibly hard to switch into. Aim to have Chandelure out under these conditions when possible.


Team Options
========

This Chandelure does need quite a bit of support. Hazard removal is a must as Chandelure is vulnerable to all kinds. The usual suspects Excadrill, Forretress and Scizor are all good options with their ability to bait Fire-type attacks. Starmie is also a good option as Chandelure can take chunks out of Specially defensive foes which might allow Starmie to clean up lategame. Entry hazards of your own can help Chandelure break through opponents it might have struggled with otherwise, so packing a setter is important. Finally, Special attackers who struggle with defensive foes can benefit from Chandelure's ability to blast off large portions of their HP. For example, Latios and Latias both enjoy the demise of their arch enemy Tyranitar.


Other Options
########

Chandelure has a few other avenues to explore if you're feeling adventurous. A Calm Mind set can raise Chandelure's already huge Special Attack to even greater heights, but is difficult to set up in practice due to its poor defensive typing. Will-o-Wisp can actually trouble some of Chandelure's switch-ins, but generally you will want to be on the offensive whilst Chandelure is on the field.
Chandelure has a couple of options to remedy its mediocre Speed aside from Choice Scarf - the first is Flame Charge, which itself unbelievably weak but can pick off a severely weakened enemy and boost Chandelure's Speed simultaneously to potentially set up a sweep. The second is Trick Room, which provides four turns in which Chandelure can outspeed normally faster foes. This is decent against offensive teams but generally Chandelure does not possess the bulk for the job.


Checks & Counters
########

**Tyranitar**: All variants of Tyranitar pose a huge threat to Chandelure. It resists both Chandelure's STABs, obliterates it with Crunch or Rock Slide and has Pursuit to put it into a no-win situation. Offensive variants fear Hidden Power Fighting, but Specially Defensive or Assault Vest variants can stomach one hit and KO back.

**Faster Attackers**: Chandelure's subpar speed and mediocre defences means fast, powerful offensive threats can switch into a resisted attack and threaten to KO. Good examples include Terrakion and Keldeo who can both take a Fire Blast on the switch, outspeed and obliterate Chandelure with Stone Edge and Hydro Pump / Surf respectively.

**Super Effective Priority**: Chandelure packs useful immunities and resistances to common priority moves like Mach Punch, Bullet Punch and Ice Shard, but also weaknesses to Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch. Common users of these moves such as Azumarill, Mega Mawile and Bisharp, as well as Talonflame's Brave Bird, should all be feared as they can do massive damage to Chandelure.

**Blissey and Chansey**: The pink blobs can withstand any attacking move the Choice sets can throw at them and threaten Chandelure with paralysis, or use the free turns to heal its team. Yet they are shaky counters because Chandelure has ways to annoy them, such as Trick on the Choice sets and Pain Split on the Substitute set.
