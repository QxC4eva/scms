Confuses the target.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 100% chance to confuse the target. Damage is boosted to 1.2x by the ability Iron Fist</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>An interesting move, DynamicPunch. It guarantees that the opponent will be confused so long as it hits, which is not as reliable as would be comfortable, considering the move's 50% accuracy in normal conditions. Thus, the only real users are the ones on Machamp's line since they have the No Guard ability, which ignores the accuracy and evasion of all moves and Pokemon, meaning that their attacks always hit. Thus, not only is the opponent facing down guaranteed confusion on the switch, but is also smacked with a 100 Base Power STAB move off of 130 base Attack. The Golurk line can use this same strategy since they also get both No Guard and DynamicPunch, though it lacks STAB on DynamicPunch.</p>

<p>While the move Gravity is in play DynamicPunch gains a decent 83% accuracy, and so can be used more effectively. The problem now is that there are literally no Pokemon who can use it well, and Gravity is such an obscure, hard-to-use field effect that you will probably never see it in most competitive matches.</p>
