Overview
########
- Enjoys no more Drizzle-Swift Swim ban but has less time to sweep because Rain now only lasts 5 or 8 turns.
- Has access to Swords Dance to sweep, but once again lacks time.
- Has a decent STAB combination between Water and Rock.
- Weak and mostly redundant coverage moves, but Low Kick stands out.
- Excellent offensive spinner, being able to Knock Off opposing spinblockers.
- Overall has a niche as a powerful rain sweeper and Rapid Spinner.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Knock Off / Low Kick / Aqua Jet / Rapid Spin
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk/4 Def/252 Spd

Moves
========
- Swords Dance is the best reason to use Kabutops, as it can boost and Waterfall is the strongest STAB under rain, capable of OHKOing Pokemon like Landorus-T after a boost, factoring Intimidate.
- Stone Edge is your secondary STAB with good coverage, hitting most Water resists at least neutrally.
- Knock Off lets it beat opposing spinblockers, notably Jellicent and Trevenant.
- Low Kick is good for Pokemon that resist his dual STAB like Ferrothorn.
- Aqua Jet is a strong priority move for Choice Scarfers or Mach Punch users.
- Rapid Spin provides utility at the cost of coverage, removing hazards from your side of field.

Set Details
=======
- Swift Swim doubles his speed under rain, beating slower Choice Scarfers and faster opposing Pokemon while powering up Waterfall.
- Life Orb provides a significant power boost while allowing it to switch moves.
- Adamant nature provides power, and you still outspeed everything important in rain, bar extremely fast Scarfers, which can take an Aqua Jet.

Usage Tips
========
- Kabutops needs to be played as a late game sweeper in rain.
- Keep your Politoed alive at all costs. If you need to sacrifice it, make sure you can send Kabutops in right after.

Team Options
========
- Politoed is pretty much the only reason to use Kabutops in the first place.
- Ways to beat bulky grass types like Gourgeist or Ferrothorn (if not using Low Kick).
- Fire types beat most of his checks, but are weakened by rain, so more unconventional methods may work.
- Hazards grant him many KOs, so SR setters are appreciated. Forretress can take hits for him, while in Rain Kabutops effectively 8x resists Fire.
- Talonflame takes care of Gourgeist, Skarmory, Breloom, Virizion, and Mega Venusaur.
- Conkeldurr beats Ferrothorn, and enjoys being Burned by Rotom-W which Kabutops hates.
- Sylveon
- Landorus-T
- Scizor
- Rotom-W

Other Options
########
- Choice Band
- Night Slash
- X-Scissor
- Weak Armor
- Rain Dance
- Brick Break is a more reliable Fighting-type move, but note that Ferrothorn takes more from Low Kick. 
- Stealth Rock
