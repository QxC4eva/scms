<p>Well, as some of you may know, I didn't do very well at VGC, I lost round four by one HP to a zero clone, but there was some success. I won King of the Hill!</p>

<h2>King of the Hill</h2>

<h3>Game 1</h3>
<p>So my first opponent had been waiting for a while for someone to come play, and he seemed pretty confident. He lead Mewtwo/Gallade. I missed one Hydro Pump on Gallade, but Ludicolo KO'd Mewtwo while Gallade Leaf Bladed my Kyogre. He brought in Shiftry, I Ice Beam'd for the KO on that and hit Hydro Pump hit this time for the KO on Gallade. He now brought in his last, a Rapidash. After the next Hydro Pump he was slightly less confident.</p>

<h3>Game 2</h3>
<p>I actually can't remember this much, but I remember that I hit 4/5 Hydro Pumps to win in 2.5 turns. Sorry about that man.</p>

<h3>Game 3</h3>
<p>This guy led Dugtrio/Ninjask. I wasn't really sure what was going on, so I Ice Beam'd both of them. Ludicolo outsped and KO'd Dugtrio, Ninjask then Flash'd my Ludicolo, wtf. Then Kyogre brought Ninjask to Sash. So I switched Ludicolo out for Palkia, first time anyone had seen anything but my leads. I then swept, taking one Aerial Ace from Ninjask. GG</p>

<h3>Game 4</h3>
<p>Oh, noes, Tyler422. This scrub led with Metagross+Gengar with Kyogre+Ludicolo in the back, I Fake'd Out + Hydro Pump to KO the meta, while Gengar protected. He went on to para two of my Pokemon and Thunder crit Kyogre for the KO, before I finally brought it to 60% Kyogre v 40% Palkia. I knew I had lost to Thunder, but wait Spacial Rend crit, hell yeah pwnt that scrub.</p>

<h3>Game 5</h3>
<p>The last obstacle, one more game and hell yeah I'm the King of the Hill (BTW, if you skipped the intro and after being quite confused are just now realizing this was about King of the Hill, please post, I'd like to know how many of you there are.) He led Ampharos/Gallade, and I'm thinking, "Hell, yeah, I've got this, I'm going to be the effing king." Double Hydro Pump, double miss. Ouch. I eat a Leaf Blade to Kyogre, but to the awe of the crowd I survive (lol) and Sitrus activates. Ludicolo takes a Charge Beam fine, and haha no SpA boost for you. Double Hydro Pump, double miss. Double ouch. Kyogre is not KO'd by the second Leaf Blade, (even more crowd awe, and hack accusations, cause it's shiny) while Ludiolo goes down to a Signal Beam. I bring in Palkia. Double Hydro Pump, double hit! Had you going didn't I? In comes Emploen/Toxicroak, uh oh. I Thunder for the KO on Wacanless Empoleon, then I Thunder Toxicroak and crit ftw. Hell yeah.</p>
