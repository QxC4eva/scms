<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raises the power of Steel-type moves 20% when this item is held.</p>

<p>Causes Onix and Scyther to evolve into Steelix and Scizor when traded.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Metal Coat generally does not see much competitive play. This is partly due to the fact that few Pokemon are able to effectively use multiple attacks of the same type. Therefore, most trainers will opt to use items that provide bigger boosts to a wider range of attacks, such as <a href="/dp/items/choice_band">Choice Band</a>, which boosts the power of physical attacks, <a href="/dp/items/choice_specs">Choice Specs</a>, which boosts the power of special attacks, or <a href="/dp/items/life_orb">Life Orb</a>, which boosts the power of both kinds of attacks. Metal Coat does not have side effects, which all three alternative items carry with them.</p>
