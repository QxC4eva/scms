[page]
<p>Badges are bestowed upon users who contribute positively to Smogon in a significant way. Users are badged as a sign of recognition for the type of work they have done for the site. Trophies are given to the winners of Smogon's most prestigious Tournaments. <strong>Badges are given out completely at the discretion of the Smogon administration, and imply a recognition of effort, maturity on the forums and in any Smogon chat, and the responsibility all badged users share: improving the site.</strong></p>

<p>Users with at least one badge have their account upgraded from Registered User to Community Member and gain the ability to use attachments, have slightly larger avatars sizes, and change their custom title. In addition, it also grants some editing access to articles on the site. Badged users are also welcome to participate in internal site discussions. A comprehensive list of badgeholders is available <a href="/forums/pages/badgeholders/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Any users who want to contribute to Smogon are always encouraged to do so, but remember that being badged is a special recognition and a privilege. As such, asking to be badged is never a good idea, and doing so will never hasten the process. Hard work does not go unnoticed, but neither do overzealous senses of entitlement. Most badges have an associated Badge Leader who is responsible for identifying and nominating new candidates.</p>

<strong>Here are the different classes of badges and how to get them:</strong>

<h2>Contribution</h2>

<p><img src="/media/forums/images/badges/ladybug.png" alt="Pre-Contributor"> User is a Pre-Contributor. Pre-Contributors are helpful in the <a href="/forums/#contribute.27">Contributions & Corrections forum</a>, regularly posting and editing articles for the site. Users may also earn the Pre-Contributor badge for being extremely positive influences in other parts of the forums. It can also be given out as a "trial" badge for users who are close to obtaining a badge, but still need a push in the right direction for that particular badge. Pre-Contributor is considered an easy-to-get and easy-to-lose badge. If another badge is awarded to a user with this badge, the Pre-Contributor badge will be removed.</p>

<p><img src="/media/forums/images/badges/contributor.png" alt="Contributor"> User is a Contributor. Contributors write and edit articles for the site. Note that being recognized as a contributor requires a significant amount of quality content submitted to the site, such as guides, articles, and analyses. Users who have not already been badged will very rarely be awarded a contributor badge. Visit the <a href="/forums/#contribute.27">Contributions & Corrections forum</a> for more information.</p>

<p><img src="/media/forums/images/badges/tc.png" alt="Tiering Contributor"> User is a Tiering Contributor. Tiering Contributors have made a concerted effort to contribute to the creation, modification, and facilitation of the policies that shape both the present and future of competitive Pokemon. The badge is activity-based, meaning users have this badge only when they have voted at least four times in a tier, as well as a consistent forum presence by posting in the suspect threads, the respective metagames forums, and the Policy Review forum. An alumnus version of this badge is granted for those who either lead a tier or made 8 votes to a tiering process.</p>

<p><img src="/media/forums/images/badges/cc.png" alt="Community Contributor"> User is a Community Contributor. This badge is awarded to those who have contributed to the forums by posting and leading high quality discussion in our discussion forums. In addition, this badge can have other applications for superb work in areas that are not presently recognized by another badge. This is a badge that is maintained only with high levels of activity.</p>

<p><img src="/media/forums/images/badges/tr.png" alt="Team Rater"> User is a recognized Team Rater. Team Raters provide frequent constructive advice to those who post in topics in the <a href="/forums/forums/rate-my-team.52/">Rate My Team forum</a>.</p>

<p>It should be noted that all badges are based on constant activity, <em>except</em> Contributor, Programmer, Researcher, Smogon Media Contributor, CAP Contributor, and Artist. These badges are permanent. Do not think that once you're badged you can just stop contributing, though; that shows poor attitude. Any and all badges can be stripped for having a bad attitude, and badged users can be infracted. Being badged means you should hold yourself to a higher standard of maturity in the forum and on the server, which is why a person would be badged in the first place along with contributions.</p>

<p>If a badged person has made significant contributions to the site and/or forums but stops contributing, he/she can be rewarded with one of the Alumni badges. These greyed out versions of the normal badges show the great appreciation the Smogon staff has for the Alumnus' contributions.</p>
