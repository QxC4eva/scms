Overview
########
- Disappearence of Soul Dew and the rise of Fairy Arceus as well as other metagame shifts have left Steel Arceus in obscurity.
- Still has a significant advantage in that it is naturally immune to Toxic, an omniprescent move in Ubers.
- Steel typing still has plenty of useful resists giving Steel Arceus some significant use for a team. It can even check the ever popular Geomancy Xerneas if they drop Focus Blast for a different coverage move, a fairly common occurence.
- It also suffers a lot more from it's weaknesses with new threats like Mega Blaziken being so dominant as well as losing resistences to Dark- and Ghost-type moves that it had before.

Moves
========

- Judgment is a reliable STAB move that has become a lot more useful offensively with the introduction of Fairy types. It still maintains a number of common resistences but the lack of immunities makes it an acceptable move for a mono-attacking set.
- Calm Mind boosts Steel Arceus's Judgment so that it can muscle past bulkier Pokemon as well as boosts it's Special Defense to make Steel Arceus that much more difficult to take down.
- Recover keeps Steel Arceus healthy so that it can do more things.
- Will-O-Wisp burns Ground-types like Landorus-T and Groudon that could otherwise tank a Judgment and hit back hard with a strong Earthquake. It also works well with Calm Mind in general as it cripples any physical attacker much like how Calm Mind makes Arceus more resilient to special attacks.
- Thunder makes up for the mediocre coverage Steel-type Judgment has at times by nailing Kyogre and Ho-Oh.
- Roar can beat Pokemon that attempt to phaze away Steel Arceus's boost by forcing them out first. It can also help win against other Arceus formes in Calm Mind wars.
- Substitute blocks status Steel Arceus isn't immune to like paralysis and burn as well as moves like Leech Seed.

Set Details
========

- Maximum HP with maximum Speed is best to take hits as well as possible while being able to outspeed as many threats as possible to Calm Mind or Will-O-Wisp before attacks.

Usage Tips
========

- Scouting sets is fairly important to Steel Arceus as it can be very successful or less so depending on the coverage moves certain Pokemon choose. For example, Xerneas that opt out of Focus Blast or Groudon with Lum Berry. Granted, some sets are very difficult to scout due to the nature of the Pokemon but they are variables to consider when constructing a game plan with Steel Arceus.
- At the same time, the Toxic immunity allows you to play a bit more recklessly without fearing losing your Calm Mind Arceus to common filler move.
- Steel Arceus's wide array of resistences allows makes it easy for it to be active outside of trying to sweep with Calm Mind and check assorted threats like Zekrom's Outrage or defensive Fairy-types.
- Calm Mind can be used to force your opponent's hand into bringing out specific checks so that Steel Arceus can hit it with an attack and switch out before it risks fainting. For example, using Calm Mind on a Palkia can force Roar Dialga into play so that you can burn it and get residual damage on a check. Even if your opponent anticipates this and considers going straight to the check, simply the threat of Calm Mind has done its job and you can opt to go straight for Will-O-Wisp.
- Keep in mind a last mon Steel Arceus can't be phazed out. You can let your teammates die off if your opponent's only remaining check to Steel Arceus is Roar, Whirlwind, or Dragon Tail.

Team Options
========

- Kyogre pairs well with Steel Arceus, especially if it opts to use Thunder, as Steel Arceus is quite vulnerable to Fire-types and Kyogre's rain can help limit the damage they deal to your team. 
- Ground-type switch-ins, like Landorus-T, can be valuable to avoid getting smashed by an Earthquake, more so if you drop Will-O-Wisp.
- Landorus-T can also switch into Thunder Waves aimed at Steel Arceus.
- Having other special attackers, like Darkrai, that lure out defensive Kyogre is helpful to overload it and open a path for Steel Arceus to sweep.

Other Options
########

- Ice Beam can nail Landorus-T and Rayquaza but it's a very specialized move that doesn't synergize well with the other moves Steel Arceus uses.
- Toxic is nice for crippling opposing Calm Mind Arceus and other Pokemon that aren't bothered by Will-O-Wisp's burn drop.

Checks & Counters
########

- **Fire-types**: Charizard, Ho-Oh, and Blaziken are all very dangerous for a Steel Arceus. Thunder may help with Ho-Oh, Charizard Y, and, to a certain extent, Mega Blaziken but even then there remains the threat of Mega Charizard X and even the odd Reshiram. Heatran can easily switch in and phaze with Roar or burn with Lava Plume. If Heatran managed to come in on Will-O-Wisp and the Steel Arceus didn't use Calm Mind, its Lava Plume can leave quite a dent.
- **Kyogre**: Defensive Kyogre can easily switch into Steel Arceus, attack it with Scald to get a burn, and then phaze out the boost it gathered with Roar. Boosted Thunders are bothersome, though.
- **Ground-types**: Groudon, Excadrill, Ground Arceus, and Landorus-T can also pester Steel Arceus if it lacks Will-O-Wisp or if the Ground-type holds a Lum Berry.
- **Zekrom**: If Steel Arceus drops Will-O-Wisp for Thunder, Zekrom can easily switch in and spam Bolt Strike. The inperfect accuracy and low pp being offset by the high power and paralysis chance.
- **Dialga**: Has no difficulty in switching in and phazing Steel Arceus out with Roar.
- **Mewtwo**: Mega Mewtwo X outspeeds and can crush Steel Arceus with his Fighting-type STAB. Mega Mewtwo Y can engage in a CM war of sorts and take advantage of its excellent stats and movepool to break Steel Arceus. Steel Arceus will need to not have gathered any Calm Mind boosts beforehand for Mega Mewtwo Y to be successful.
- **Klefki**: Can abuse its priority Thunder Wave to cripple Steel Arceus and open it up to slower Pokemon that it wasn't vulnerable to before as well as prevent it from using Recover repeatedly.
- **Lucario**: Lucario is fragile, dislikes burns, and is slower than Steel Arceus but it resists Judgment and has a power STAB Close Combat.
