<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome again to Smogon in a Nutshell. I say "welcome" because I assume you've stuck with me for the past three years I have written this annual feature. If you have not, that is OK too; I'm glad to have you on board. Both old and new users can feel free to reminisce or learn about all the events that took place during 2014 (at least the ones I can be bothered to remember). There was a lot that happened in 2014, our tenth year of existence. Here is our best, our worst, and sometimes just our most memorable events. Which even are best and which are worst, I'll leave up to you. Without further ado, join me as we travel down memory lane.</p>

        <p>After much careful deliberation, Swagger is banned from OU to Ubers. This is a result of the numerous cases where SwagPlay makes the game just plain annoying to play. Primary reasons include Prankster + Swagger + Thunder Wave-based teams that allow sweepers like Mega Gyarados and Ditto to easily sweep crippled teams and the removal of player autonomy. Players who really want to play with this strategy are free to hit their head upon a wall repeatedly to get the same effect.</p>

        <p>Smogon launches a special limited time T-shirt sale to the general public, for which Smogon users are recruited to model the shirts. The sales goal to print is broken in an hour, hundreds are sold, and it is considered a massive success for a fake university shirt brand. We also sent all those lewd comments about skylight wearing the shirt to the police.</p>

        <p>After much heartbreak, site owner chaos decides to close the PS! Room Suggestions forum because nobody was actually suggesting rooms of any value.

        <p>Shadow Tag is declared to be banned from Ubers due to some controversial vote-discarding, which is immediately overturned by site owner, chaos. Shadow Tag is henceforth not banned from Ubers as the community voted. Thus chaos makes a thread to clear up the events and makes it clear that the recent PS! server malfunctions have nothing to do with this suspect test. Through this, chaos vows to still find some way he can ban admin Haunter.</p>

        <p>User PROBLEMS puts forth a proposal to ban or nerf Mega Rayquaza from Ubers, as it is the first Pok&eacute;mon with a near-800 BST that has not only a good ability but also the capacity to Mega Evolve without holding a Mega Stone. Despite the recent events of Ubers doing weird stuff with bans, all see the validity in ousting a Pok&eacute;mon that will have close to 100% usage in the tier. The same week, the Anything Goes tier is created, and Ubers becomes an official competitive tier.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was quite the big year for competitive Pok&eacute;mon: we are reaching new levels of popularity, and it's not beyond question to see another ten years of Smogon leading the way in the competitive Pok&eacute;mon world. I'm not sure if I'll still be around to push out these yearly Nutshell articles, so for now, I'll just hope to see you all here next year as well!</p>
