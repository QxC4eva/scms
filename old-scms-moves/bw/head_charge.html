Has 25% recoil.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage, and the user receives recoil damage equal to 1/4 of the damage dealt, rounded half up, but not less than 1 HP.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Head Charge is simply a better Double-Edge. Unfortunately, only Bouffalant learns it (not counting Smeargle). With 110 base Attack and STAB backing it, Head Charge is an excellent move for Bouffalant. However, 55 base Speed really limits what could have been an excellent Pokemon. Still, Head Charge should be on almost any Bouffalant set, if you happen to be using one.</p>
