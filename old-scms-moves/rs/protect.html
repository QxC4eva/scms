[SHORT DESC]
Prevents anything from working on the user that turn.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Prevents anything from working on the user next turn. Perish Song hits through Protect. Consecutive uses lower the chance of working by 50%, so the first use has a 100% success rate, and if it is used the following turn again, it has a 50% chance to work, and then it has a 25% chance to work. Detect, Endure, and Protect are all on the same counter, so if a Pok√©mon uses Detect, Endure, and Protect, Protect will have a 25% chance to work.
