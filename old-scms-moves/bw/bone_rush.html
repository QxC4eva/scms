Hits 2-5 times in one turn.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. It has a 1/3 chance for the move to hit either 2 or 3 times, and a 1/6 chance to hit either 4 or 5 times. If a Focus Sash or the ability Sturdy is activated through one of the hits, another hit will KO the target. Each hit is treated as a separate attack, and thus abilities such as Weak Armor will activate for every hit taken, and every hit has a separate flinch rate if used with King's Rock, Razor Fang, or Stench, and a separate critical hit chance. Color Change will only activate on the last hit of the move. However, the items Life Orb and Metronome treat all the hits as a single attack. If this move breaks a Substitute, the attack can still continue and hurt the target. If the target holds a Shuca, Jaboca, or Enigma Berry, it will only affect the first hit of this move. If the user has the ability Skill Link, this move will always hit five times.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Bone Rush should generally not be considered for competitive use due to its poor Base Power and distribution. Unless this move hits 5 times, it will be either weaker or have the same Base Power as Earthquake and Bonemerang, which is the preferred move for hitting through Substitute as far as Marowak is concerned, though this does not factor in the chance of a critical hit happening. The other two fully-evolved Pokemon that learn the move, Lucario and Mandibuzz, can usually find better coverage options, though Mandibuzz does lack a better Ground-type attack. If a Pokemon with Skill Link got this move, it would be a different story; however, this move is more or less pointless while a reliable alternative like Earthquake exists.</p>
