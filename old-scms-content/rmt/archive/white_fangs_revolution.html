<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello everyone, I hereby present my first RMT. This is a team that I have used extensively in the early BW2, before the arrival of Garchomp in the tier.It is one of my favorite teams and I have had a lot of success with it, winning the #pokemon tournament for example, which is why I present today. I hope you enjoy :d</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/455.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Hippowdon</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 36 Def / 216 SpD / 4 Spe<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Fang<br />
- Slack Off<br />
- Stealth Rock</p>

<p>I needed Sandstorm for Stoutland, so my choice would therefore involve either or Hippowdon or Tyranitar. Since I didnâ€™t really like the latter, I immediately tried Hippowdon. It's also not trapped by Dugtrio which is extremely useful, especially against Sun Teams.</p>

<p>For the distribution of EV's, I chose a middle ground between the Defensive and Specially Defensive sets. It does not hurt Hippowdon to take Special or Physical Moves, and it can Slack Off the damage. Impish Nature takes hits better on the physical side and Leftovers to regain health every turn for increased longevity.</p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Flash Fire<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 216 SpD / 40 Spe<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Lava Plume<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Protect<br />
- Toxic</p>

<p>The first member of Fire Water Grass core. Real counter of Genesect, and it is just great at defending Special Attacks. It allows you to check all Fire Pokemon, and usually Sun Teams without Dugtrio have a hard time beating it.</p>

<p>Distribution is easy, I reach 200 speed and allows me to outspeed all defensive Heatran and Pokemon that aim for that benchmark. This also allows me to be able to catch opposing Heatran with Earth Power. The rest is put into HP and SpeDef for obvious reasons of bulk. I use Leftovers to regain 6% per turn and thus prolong its life. Protect and opposing switches make sure Heatran is healthy throughout the game. Calm nature for obvious reasons of special bulk.</p>

<p><strong>Amoonguss</strong> @ Black Sludge<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 40 Def / 216 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Giga Drain<br />
- Spore<br />
- Clear Smog<br />
- Stun Spore</p>

<p>Second member of the Water Fire Grass Core, it helps to have a good weapon with which to face rain teams because it is able to take almost all Special Attacks. It also allows me to put opposing Pokemon to sleep. Sleep is always beneficial, and Amoongus can paralyze other Pokemon to facilitate my switches. Amoongus is a perfect check to Breloom and Water Pokemon.</p>

<p>EV distribution allows me to take as much damage on the specially defensive side. 40 Defense EVs allow me to take a little more physical beating and mainly Psyshock of Starmie that often comes when they think they will OHKO me. Leftovers to regain my life (or not losing is when there is SandStorm). A Calm nature to better take special moves (mainly water types).</p>

<p><strong>Starmie</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 136 HP / 64 Def / 56 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Scald<br />
- Psyshock<br />
- Recover<br />
- Rapid Spin</p>

<p>I really need a spinner, after playing Jellicent for a long time, the stall team were horrible to face if they managed to put all their hazards. So I opted for Starmie, and he completed the FWG core more.</p>

<p>For EV distribution, it's pretty simple, I do not like not being max speed with him. Whenever I tested, I always regretted less speed. Distribution allows me to take hits relatively well and weak priority moves. 56 SpAtk EVs to hit the relatively stronger Fighting Pokes like Conkeldurr that upset me. Timid nature to be the fastest possible.</p>

<p><strong>Landorus</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Sheer Force<br />
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- U-turn<br />
- Earth Power<br />
- Focus Blast<br />
- Hidden Power Ice</p>

<p>It is the perfect partner for Stoutland because it lures the majority of stallers thanks to it usually having a physical movepool. It does well against Bulkys Offense by OHKO/2HKOing a large portion of the metagame. He enjoys SR to KO Stoutland checks.</p>

<p>The simple 252/252 to enter the strongest possible as soon as possible. LO with Sheer Force, since Earth Power and Focus Blast won't damage Landorus.</p>

<p><strong>Stoutland</strong> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Sand Rush<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Return<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Wild Charge<br />
- Superpower</p>

<p>Being faster than other Pokemon is really important in a metagame as offensive as BW2. With the decline in use Scizor, Stoutland is back stronger than BW1, with a range of new threats to revenge kill. It obviously benefits the work of Landorus, which successfully eliminates physical walls. This is a late-game sweeper. </p>

<p>Choice Band to hit as hard as possible, Adamant to hit harder and EV distribution to hit as hard as possible and the fastest too. Not much to explain again.</p>
