Overview
########

Onix is a niche Pokemon thanks to its unique stats and ability. Due to its Speed, it functions differently from Geodude, as it can Taunt and KO Pokemon faster than Geodude can. This is important when dealing with Sticky Web and Shell Smashers. Compared to Archen and other Stealth Rock users, Sturdy gives it the ability to reliably check a large amount of Pokemon, even ones that use super effective moves, such as Magnemite.

Moves
========

Earthquake is Onix's main STAB attack. Rock Blast is a very useful secondary STAB attack to deal with opposing Sturdy Pokemon as well as Substitute users such as Torchic. Stealth Rock is one of the main reasons to use Onix. Thanks to its high Defense and access to Sturdy, it will have enough turns to set Stealth Rock up while also dealing damage or Taunting an opponent's setup Pokemon. Taunt makes Onix the perfect counter to Shell Smashers and RestTalkers, also preventing setup by Dwebble and status moves such as Will-O-Wisp from Vulpix. Roar can more reliably get Pokemon out if Onix isn't fast enough to Taunt them or strong enough to KO them, such as when against Misdreavus.

Set Details
========

The EVs are standard; maximum Speed is to outpace most middling Pokemon such as Dwebble or Tirtouga. Attack is maxed and 76 HP EVs brings Onix to 21 HP, which allows it to recover a full 20 HP from Berry Juice after Sturdy activates. It should be noted that at this Speed, Onix still Speed ties with Timid Surskit.

Usage Tips
========

Onix has two major ways of influencing a game. If there is a Pokemon that the team needs it to counter such as Fletchling, it can be kept alive and sent in whenever Fletchling makes an appearance to set up Stealth Rock. If there is not a Pokemon that Onix needs to be saved for or there is a Pokemon such as Spinarak or Dwebble that aims to set up on the first turn, Onix functions as an exceptional lead due to its ability to beat or damage Pokemon one-on-one while still getting Stealth Rock up.

Team Options
========

Onix is a Pokemon that works on just about any team in need of a reliable Stealth Rock user. It also has a fast Taunt, so it's quite useful for other Pokemon that rely on Sturdy and Focus Sash, such as Magnemite or Diglett. It gets forced out quite easily by Mienfoo after Stealth Rock is set up, so a switch-in to it such as Trubbish works nicely with Onix. Trubbish also deals with Grass-types quite well.

Other Options
########

A Curse + Dragon Tail set could probably be used, but it's outclassed immensely by most other Pokemon. Heavy Slam can be used to hit Fairy-types. Toxic can be used to hit bulky switch-ins such as Mienfoo. An offensive set with Rock Polish could also work, but Onix lacks the power to be threatening enough after a Speed boost. Stone Edge can be used over Rock Blast to hit specific Pokemon such as Archen without triggering Berry Juice. Explosion can be used as a last-ditch effort to KO a Rapid Spin or Defog user, but again, Onix suffers from a low Attack stat.


Checks & Counters
########

**Multi-Hit Moves**: Onix has the most trouble with certain setup sweepers that can either outpace it or have multi-hit moves. Shellder comes to mind as a Pokemon that can heavily threaten Onix. Though it can't set up due to Taunt, it can bypass Sturdy with Icicle Spear.

**Bulky Fighting-types**: Onix has a very low Attack stat, so any bulky Fighting-type can switch into Earthquake and recover any lost HP with Drain Punch.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Similar to Fighting-types, Grass-types can break Onix easily while healing themselves of any Earthquake or Rock Blast damage with Giga Drain.

**Drilbur**: Drilbur is specifically very good at countering Onix due to Mold Breaker allowing it to KO through Sturdy and its ability to use Rapid Spin.
