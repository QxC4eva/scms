<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Before the introduction of Black and White, NFEs were never  seen in competitive play, with the exception of the (worst) tier most  know as... Little Cup. However, with the fifth generation came a new  item, one that not only revolutionized the way Little Cup was played,  but also made many prior NFEs viable in competitive play, albeit mostly  in the lower tiers. This mystical item is called the Eviolite, which  grants the holder, should it be an NFE Pok&eacute;mon, with a 1.5x  boost to both Defense and Special Defense, a considerable increase in  overall bulk. Previously, Pok&eacute;mon such as Chansey would never  have been used in OU thanks to the presence of its fully evolved form,  Blissey, which sports better overall stats. Eviolite changes all of  that; Chansey, for example, has benefited so much from this simple boost  that it has now firmly cemented its place in BW OU. Eviolite has turned  former non-threats such as Chansey and Porygon2 into formidable  defensive behemoths. Eviolite can also help bulky boosters, such as  Rhydon and Duosion, have an easier time of setting up. It is great for  both offense- and defense-oriented NFEs, and has certainly made a large  impact on the diverse metagames of BW, ranging from OU all the way down  to Little Cup.</p>

<h2>OU</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/113.png" alt="Chansey" />  <img src="/download/sprites/bw/233.png" alt="Porygon2"  /></p>

<h3>Chansey</h3>

<p>At first glance, Chansey may seem to be completely outclassed  by its evolution, Blissey, which sports better overall stats. However,  when Chansey is holding an Eviolite, it becomes bulkier than Blissey, to  the point where it can even withstand unSTABed super effective  Fighting-type attacks. Chansey provides all of the same utility that  Blissey does, but with more bulk. The tools that Chansey brings to the  table have elevated it from UU into OU, where it has been doing well on a  variety of teams. In particular, Chansey has become a staple on rain  stall teams, as it can take basically any special move in the entire  game and either heal up with Softboiled / Wish or cripple the opponent  with status.</p>

<p>However, even with the enormous boost to its defenses courtesy  of Eviolite, Chansey still suffers from some disadvantages when compared  with Blissey. Chansey may have better overall defenses, but it misses  out on passive recovery from Leftovers. While this may seem  insignificant on a Pok&eacute;mon that has access to an  instantaneous recovery move, it makes Chansey much more susceptible to  residual damage from the likes of sandstorm and random detrimental  statuses such as burn and poison. In addition, Chansey has a much lower  Special Attack stat than Blissey, meaning that it must rely on Seismic  Toss in order to do any damage other than Toxic. Unfortunately, this  usually means Chansey will be walled by things such as Gengar and  defensive Calm Mind Reuniclus, among others. Blissey, on the other hand,  is able to use moves such as Flamethrower and Ice Beam to deter certain  threats such as Scizor, and these moves will always break Gengar's  Substitutes.</p>

<p>When using Chansey, make sure to keep in mind its benefit over  Blissey, namely its higher defenses. In general, the rule of thumb when  deciding to use either Chansey or Blissey is that Blissey can actually  attack with its higher Special Attack stat and does better on sandstorm  teams due to Leftovers recovery, while Chansey can take more physical  hits and use a somewhat gimmicky Counter set. Overall, the choice really  depends on your team.</p>

<h4>Example Set</h4>

<p>Chansey @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Natural Cure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD<br />
Nature: Bold (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Wish<br />
- Protect / Softboiled<br />
- Seismic Toss<br />
- Toxic / Thunder Wave</p>

<h3>Porygon2</h3>

<p>Porygon2, despite its somewhat recent shift to the UU tier, has  been widely used in the OU tier and has also been dubbed a "universal  counter" of sorts, thanks to its amazing defenses with the Eviolite  boost and its handy ability, Trace. Of course, the fun doesn't stop  there. Porygon2 also has a decent base 105 Special Attack, and with a  movepool that includes the deadly BoltBeam combination as well as  instant recovery in the form of Recover, Porygon2 is no slouch when it  comes to striking back. The combination of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt /  Discharge allows Porygon2 to 2HKO or even OHKO numerous threats in OU,  such as Salamence, Gliscor, and Gyarados. Furthermore, Trace allows  Porygon2 to wall some of the most dangerous Pok&eacute;mon in OU  that possess abilities like Flash Fire, Volt Absorb, and Water Absorb,  such as Heatran, Jolteon, and Vaporeon, respectively. Trace also works  well against Pok&eacute;mon with the Intimidate ability, using it  against them to lower their Attack upon switching in.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even an extremely useful Pok&eacute;mon such  as Porygon2 has its faults, which probably caused its fall from OU to  UU. First off, Porygon2 is extremely slow, meaning that it will almost  always take a hit before dishing one out. This can prove to be a fatal  flaw, should your opponent carry an extremely hard-hitting  Pok&eacute;mon such as Choice Band Terrakion, which can cleanly OHKO  Porygon2 even with the Eviolite boost. Porygon2's Normal typing is both  a curse and a blessing, as it leaves Porygon2 with only one immunity  and one weakness. Porygon2 is also extremely vulnerable to bulky Calm  Mind users such as Reuniclus, which also doesn't care about status  thanks to Magic Guard and can easily set up on it. In addition, Porygon2  absolutely despises Toxic Spikes and the Toxic status in general, as it  has no way of removing it. Entry hazards in general also do a number on  Porygon2, as it is susceptible to all three types, and with the health  lost from several layers of entry hazards, Pok&eacute;mon that could  not normally OHKO Porygon2 can now easily power through it. Taunt also  annoys Porygon2 to some extent, rendering it unable to use Recover or  status moves. Trick is yet another move that absolutely destroys any use  that Porygon2 has, taking away its precious Eviolite, which is the only  reason Porygon2 is viable in OU, and leaving it vulnerable to revenge  killing.</p>

<p>While Porygon2 is an amazing utility Pok&eacute;mon, its  flaws should always be taken into account before putting it on your  team. Porygon2 isn't meant to be the focus of any team; rather, it  serves as a very useful defensive pivot and momentum grabber, and can  stop most sweepers in their tracks. For this reason, Porygon2 does best  on balanced teams, which provide a variety of teammates that can make  good use of Porygon2's advantages. If you use it correctly, this little  cyber duck will certainly not disappoint!</p>

<h4>Example Set</h4>

<p>Porygon2 @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Download<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA<br />
Nature: Modest (+SpA, -Atk)<br />
- Tri Attack<br />
- Thunderbolt / Discharge<br />
- Ice Beam<br />
- Recover</p>

<h2>UU</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/356.png" alt="Dusclops" />  <img src="/download/sprites/bw/454.png" alt="Hippopotas"  /></p>

<h3>Dusclops</h3>

<p>In the days of ADV, Dusclops was one of the best spinblockers  thanks to its massive defenses and useful support moves. Unfortunately,  in the DPP era, Dusclops was granted an evolution, Dusknoir, which  sported better defenses and a usable Attack stat. This essentially  rendered Dusclops obsolete, at least until B/W came around. With  Eviolite, Dusclops has much better defensive stats than Dusknoir,  meaning that it eventually became more popular; it now enjoys a spot in  the UU tier, while its previously superior evolution has been left in  the dust in RU.</p>

<p>However, Dusclops does have its downsides, and many may  consider them more prominent than its upsides, perhaps the reason for  its steadily declining usage in UU. Similarly to the dilemma associated  with Chansey, Dusclops sorely misses its Leftovers recovery. Also like  Chansey, Dusclops lacks a usable Attack stat, meaning that it must rely  on Night Shade.</p>

<p>Dusclops's access to Pain Split, RestTalk, Will-O-Wisp, and  more makes it a very useful support Pok&eacute;mon, and it can  usually stop most Rapid Spinners. In addition, any attempt to outstall  Dusclops will be useless, as Dusclops's ability, Pressure, quickly  causes the opponent to lose all of their PP should they try. Overall,  Dusclops is probably one of the best spinblockers in UU, and fits well  onto most stall teams. It's amazing how Dusclops has bounced back and  forth from its glory days in ADV to its less happy days in DPP, and back  again to its (somewhat) glorious days in BW, albeit in the UU  tier.</p>

<h4>Example Set</h4>

<p>Dusclops @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 176 Def / 80 SpD<br />
Nature: Bold (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Will-O-Wisp<br />
- Pain Split<br />
- Toxic / Taunt<br />
- Night Shade / Seismic Toss</p>

<h3>Hippopotas</h3>

<p>Ever since Hippowdon was banned from UU, its little brother  Hippopotas has been the staple for UU sand teams. Hippopotas is  currently the only perma-weather starter in the tier, which already  makes it one of the most important Pok&eacute;mon. When equipped  with an Eviolite, Hippopotas's Defense shoots through the roof, allowing  it to take a multitude of physical attacks, even super effective ones.  In addition, Hippopotas has Slack Off, and can also set up Stealth Rock  for your team and phaze with Roar in order to rack up entry hazard  damage. Unlike several others which make use of the Eviolite, Hippopotas  actually has a decent HP stat to work with, meaning it can take certain  hits better.</p>

<p>Although Hippopotas sports an enormous Defense stat, its  Special Defense is severely lacking, even with the boost from Eviolite.  What makes this even worse is that all of Hippopotas's weaknesses are  often specially based, such as Water-, Grass-, and Ice-type moves,  meaning that they will easily 2HKO, or in most cases, OHKO. And again,  like many other Eviolite-reliant Pok&eacute;mon, Hippopotas is  extremely vulnerable to Trick, Knock Off, and Taunt, as well as being  very slow.</p>

<p>Hippopotas is vital to any sand team, as it provides the  eternal sandstorm that is needed. It supports teammates such as  Stoutland, which has the ability Sand Rush, doubling its Speed in  sandstorm. The sandstorm brought by this little hippo further benefits  Pok&eacute;mon with abilities such as Sand Veil, and it also  provides a means of passive damage, canceling out the opponent's  Leftovers recovery as well as doing a little damage every turn to those  that don't carry Leftovers. Hippopotas is incredibly common in UU thanks  to the aforementioned traits, and rightly so.</p>

<h4>Example Set</h4>

<p>Hippopotas @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Nature: Impish (+Def, -SpA)<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Slack Off<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Toxic / Roar</p>

<h2>RU</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/627.png" alt="Ferroseed"  /> <img src="/download/sprites/bw/207.png" alt="Gligar" />  <img src="/download/sprites/bw/82.png" alt="Magneton" /> <img  src="/download/sprites/bw/112.png" alt="Rhydon" /></p>

<h3>Ferroseed</h3>

<p>Ferroseed is perhaps one of the best mixed walls in RU thanks  to its fantastic defensive stats after the Eviolite boost. Grass / Steel  is an amazing typing for a defensive Pok&eacute;mon such as  Ferroseed, giving it a grand total of 10 resistances, including a 4x  resistance to Grass-type moves. Ferroseed is also immune to Poison-type  moves, which is a great asset to have on any defensive  Pok&eacute;mon. It doesn't have a particularly versatile movepool,  but it does well with what it has at its disposal. Ferroseed can make  good use of its access to Leech Seed, Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Thunder  Wave in order to support your team. In addition, should it get Taunted,  it can also hit most targets pretty hard with Gyro Ball, given  Ferroseed's abysmal Speed stat. Ferroseed can easily wall many of RU's  top threats if they lack a powerful Fighting- or Fire-type  move.</p>

<p>Despite Ferroseed's seemingly endless good qualities, it does  have a few drawbacks, the most obvious of which is its glaring 4x  weakness to Fire-type moves. Almost any Fire-type attack will outright  OHKO Ferroseed, and it cannot do much back to virtually any Fire-type in  return, as they resist both of Ferroseed's STAB moves. Ferroseed is  also quite slow, meaning that it is easily Taunted and can only hope to  use Gyro Ball in a futile attempt to deal some damage in such a  situation. Furthermore, it is prone to getting set up on by things that  can avoid Leech Seed and take little damage from Gyro Ball. Like with  the other Pok&eacute;mon that rely on Eviolite, Ferroseed is  extremely vulnerable if its item is removed, whether through the use of  Knock Off or Trick.</p>

<p>Ferroseed can serve as an amazing mixed wall for your team, and  can set up entry hazards to boot. This little spiky ball fits well onto  nearly any team needing a mixed wall (watch out for Fire-types!), and  it can support the team in numerous ways. Also, completely unrelated,  but how in the name of heaven does Ferroseed not know how to use the  move Rapid Spin? Have you seen its animation? It's practically a spiky  spinning top! Anyway, Ferroseed is a great addition to most teams, and  easy to use. Don't underestimate this tiny little spike ball, or you'll  be in for a world of pain (mostly psychological).</p>

<h4>Example Set</h4>

<p>Ferroseed @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Iron Barbs<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Nature: Relaxed (+Def, -Spe)<br />
- Spikes / Stealth Rock<br />
- Leech Seed<br />
- Thunder Wave / Protect<br />
- Gyro Ball</p>

<h3>Gligar</h3>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue19/viablenfes_group.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Gligar has the perfect stats with which to abuse Eviolite. It  has an enormous base 105 Defense stat and decent base 65 Special Defense  and HP stats. Not only does it have great defensive stats, but also a  decent Speed stat which allows it to outspeed many walls in RU even  without investment, and Taunt the living daylights out of them in order  to prevent itself from being statused. Its dual Ground / Flying typing  gives it many advantages, including a neutrality to Stealth Rock, an  immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and an immunity to Electric-type  moves. Gligar also has access to instant recovery in the form of Roost  (starting to see the trend here?), which allows it to easily heal off  any damage it might have taken. Gligar's movepool is also exceptionally  large, and therefore allows it to run a variety of different sets  ranging from Baton Pass, Swords Dance, Defensive, and more.</p>

<p>Gligar may be no slouch defensively, but its crippling 4x  weakness to Ice-type moves does set it back quite a bit. Many  Water-types in the RU tier run Ice Beam as a coverage  move&mdash;granted, Gligar shouldn't be staying in on Water-types in  general. Even though Gligar only has two weaknesses, to Water- and  Ice-type moves, they are some of the most common attacking types in the  entire game, meaning that Gligar will often be hard-pressed to do  anything back before getting KOed.</p>

<p>What Gligar does best is wall physical threats such as Entei,  Durant, and Scolipede. Its colossal 508 Defense after full investment  and the Eviolite boost works wonders, and with access to Roost and  Taunt, Gligar can be incredibly difficult to take down. A Swords Dance  set can hit surprisingly hard, and the EdgeQuake combination hits many  targets in RU for super effective damage. If your team is in need of a  physical wall, look no further than Gligar, one of the best RU has got  to offer (not to mention it also gets Stealth Rock!).</p>

<h4>Example Set</h4>

<p>Gligar @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Hyper Cutter<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br />
Nature: Impish (+Def, -SpA)<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Toxic / Taunt<br />
- Roost</p>

<h3>Magneton</h3>

<p>Magneton is one of the premier Steel-types in RU, if not the  best one out there. It boasts a unique dual Electric / Steel typing,  which gives it an amazing 12 total resistances, with a 4x resistance to  Steel- and Flying-type moves, as well as an immunity to Poison-type  moves. For an NFE, Magneton has one of the best stat  distributions&mdash;it has a decent base 95 Defense and a passable  base 70 Special Defense and Speed, as well as a stellar base 120 Special  Attack. Magneton is well known as a 'Steel killer', meaning that it can  trap Steel-types with its ability, Magnet Pull, and proceed to set up  and destroy them. A STAB Thunderbolt, coming off of an outstanding base  120 Special Attack, can really hurt. In fact, Magneton has the highest  Special Attack of not only any Electric-type in the tier, but also any  special attacker in the entire RU tier, with the exception of Moltres. A  simple set with Thunderbolt / Flash Cannon / Hidden Power Fire / Filler  is surprisingly effective. Magneton can also utilize Magnet Rise to  evade super effective Earthquakes. In addition, unlike many of the other  Pok&eacute;mon featured in this article, Magneton is not limited to  using an Eviolite; it can run a very effective Choice Scarf set which  dominates its usual counters, and overall, is very useful.</p>

<p>Magneton's faults are few and far between, but the one that is  instantly noticeable is its unfortunate 4x weakness to Ground-type  attacks. Although Magneton can remedy this rather problematic issue by  using Magnet Rise, it often won't get a chance to use it before getting  hit by Earthquake, due to its mediocre Speed. Magneton also sports  weaknesses to common attacking types, such as Fire- and Fighting-type  moves. Another one of Magneton's drawbacks is its relatively low Speed,  which, although can be fixed by using a Choice Scarf, still hinders it  to an extent.</p>

<p>It comes as no surprise that Magneton is fairly common in the  RU metagame, especially because of all its great attributes. Fitting  Magneton on your team is easy to do, as it can fulfill a variety of  useful roles. There's not much else to be said here, other than: GO OUT  AND USE MAGNETON ALREADY!!</p>

<h4>Example Set</h4>

<p>Magneton @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Magnet Pull<br />
EVs: 168 HP / 252 SpA / 88 Spe<br />
Nature: Modest (+SpA, -Atk)<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Hidden Power Fire<br />
- Magnet Rise</p>

<h3>Rhydon</h3>

<p>Rhydon is one of the best abusers of Eviolite, thanks to its  monstrous Defense and excellent HP stats. It also has a very high base  130 Attack with which to pummel the RU tier. Although Rock / Ground may  not be the best defensive typing out there, it certainly provides a  great STAB combo which hits nearly everything in the RU tier for super  effective or neutral damage, with the exception of Claydol, which is  easily handled by using Megahorn. It can also run a very effective  defensive set, with access to Stealth Rock and Roar / Dragon Tail. Even  its abysmal Speed can be fixed with the use of Rock Polish, which  doubles its Speed in just one turn. Rhydon's movepool is quite  expansive, with useful moves such as Swords Dance and the elemental  punches, as well as the ones mentioned above.</p>

<p>Although Rhydon is an offensive powerhouse and a useful  defensive pivot, it suffers greatly from its two 4x weaknesses to Grass-  and Water-type attacks. In addition, it has many other weaknesses,  including a weakness to Fighting-, Ground-, and Ice-type moves. While  these moves most likely won't OHKO thanks to the Eviolite boost, they  can easily 2HKO in most cases, and with Rhydon's terrible Speed, it  usually won't be able to do anything back.</p>

<p>Even though Eviolite greatly boosts Rhydon's defenses, it can  plausibly run a Life Orb set with Rock Polish to boost its Speed. With a  base 130 Attack, it can hit extremely hard, hitting the majority of the  RU tier for neutral or super effective damage, with its excellent type  coverage. Don't let Rhydon's glaring 4x weakness to Grass- and  Water-type attacks get you down; try it out!</p>

<h4>Example Set</h4>

<p>Rhydon @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Rock Head<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def<br />
Nature: Impish (+Def, -SpA)<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Stone Edge / Rock Blast<br />
- Megahorn / Substitute</p>

<h2>NU</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/200.png" alt="Misdreavus"  /> <img src="/download/sprites/bw/360.png" alt="Wynaut" />  <img src="/download/sprites/bw/664.png" alt="Zweilous"  /></p>

<h3>Misdreavus</h3>

<p>Misdreavus has the honor of being perhaps the best defensive  Ghost and spinblocker in the NU tier, its only competition being  Eviolite Frillish. It has excellent stats even before Eviolite.  Furthermore, Ghost is an excellent defensive typing, providing two  immunities (three if you include Levitate), and a few resistances.  Misdreavus also possesses a decent base 85 Special Attack stat,  something Frillish lacks, meaning that it can actually strike back  moderately hard with a STAB Shadow Ball. A whole host of awesome support  options are available to Misdreavus, including but not limited to  Will-O-Wisp, Mean Look, Perish Song, Pain Split, Taunt, and Destiny  Bond. Will-O-Wisp is arguably the most useful out of the ones mentioned,  as it absolutely cripples any physical attacker that lacks the Guts  ability, making it that much more difficult to take Misdreavus  down.</p>

<p>However, like most other Eviolite-boosted Pok&eacute;mon,  Misdreavus suffers from being slow thanks to no Speed investment, and  weaknesses to common attacking types such as Ghost- and Dark-type moves.  Many Pok&eacute;mon in the NU tier, such as Absol and Haunter, can  easily muscle through Misdreavus with their powerful, super effective  STAB moves. In addition, many physical attackers in the NU tier such as  Ursaring, Raticate, Swellow, Throh, and Gurdurr have the Guts ability,  making Will-O-Wisp useless. Shadow Ball coming off of an uninvested base  85 Special Attack won't be doing much damage to most targets unless  super effective.</p>

<p>Although Misdreavus suffers from the typical problems that  arise from relying on Eviolite, it can certainly hold its own. You won't  find a better spinblocker anywhere in NU, so make good use of  Misdreavus!</p>

<h4>Example Set</h4>

<p>Misdreavus @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 232 Def / 24 Spe<br />
Nature: Bold (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Will-O-Wisp / Toxic<br />
- Pain Split<br />
- Heal Bell / Taunt</p>

<h3>Wynaut</h3>

<p>At first glance, Wynaut seems like a terrible  Pok&eacute;mon that no one would ever use. Why, you ask? Well it's  simple, really. It has terrible stats with the exception of a slightly  above average HP stat, a grand total of 8 moves in its movepool, and  sports an appalling typing to boot. However, once you get past all of  that and take a closer look, you will find that Wynaut can be an  absolutely deadly force, thanks to its near-unique ability, Shadow Tag.  With Shadow Tag, Wynaut can trap any Pok&eacute;mon that lacks  U-turn, Volt Switch, Baton Pass, or Shed Shell. Although Wynaut's  movepool consists of a measly eight moves, it really only needs four of  those to do its job. Counter, Mirror Coat, Encore, and Tickle are all  Wynaut needs to take down the opponent. Counter and Mirror Coat deal  double the damage that was received, and with Eviolite equipped, Wynaut  can actually take quite a beating. Encore allows Wynaut to screw over  set-up sweepers, and give a free turn to a teammate while the opponent  wastes a turn either switching or being forced to use the same harmless  move again. Tickle works well with Pursuit users, as the opponent will  most likely switch after all the stat drops, making Pursuit that much  more powerful.</p>

<p>While Wynaut seems like a somewhat broken Pok&eacute;mon  thanks to its ability to take out at least one Pok&eacute;mon per  match, it does come with several disadvantages. Taunt, while not  extremely common in the NU metagame, completely screws Wynaut over, as  it can then only use Counter and Mirror Coat, leaving it susceptible to  outprediction. In addition, Counter and Mirror Coat don't affect Ghost-  and Dark-types respectively, meaning that those types can come in and  pound Wynaut with attacks without the fear of being hit for double the  damage. The best Wynaut can do at that point is Encore a move, but alas,  that won't be enough to prevent Wynaut's imminent demise. Wynaut's HP  stat may be decent, but its defenses are extremely poor, even with  Eviolite, meaning that powerful STAB super effective moves will easily  2HKO Wynaut, if not flat out OHKO.</p>

<p>Wynaut plays an interesting role on the team, as it doesn't  necessarily need any team support&mdash;rather, it endeavors to  support the rest of the team by eliminating one or more key threats. It  can be essential to eliminate certain threats in order to help a  teammate set up, and that is what Wynaut does best. So, Wynaut use  it?</p>

<h4>Example Set</h4>

<p>Wynaut @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Shadow Tag<br />
EVs: 152 Def / 148 SpD / 208 Spe<br />
Nature: Bold (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Encore<br />
- Counter<br />
- Mirror Coat<br />
- Tickle / Destiny Bond</p>

<h3>Zweilous</h3>

<p>Zweilous is a very interesting NFE, as it has several unique  traits that make it stand out among the crowd. First of all, its average  base 85 Attack is boosted to absurd levels thanks to its ability  Hustle. Secondly, it has a unique type combination: Dragon / Dark, which  gives it two very potent STABs. It has access to the extremely powerful  Outrage, and due to the lack of Steel-types in NU, it can easily smash  through entire teams if given the chance. Zweilous is also surprisingly  bulky with an Eviolite equipped, as 72 / 70 / 70 defenses become quite  good after the boost, especially with HP investment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, every rose has its thorns, and Zweilous is no  exception. Although Hustle increases the power of its physical moves by  50%, the accuracy is also lowered by 20%, making every 100% accurate  move as accurate as the ever-so-lovely Stone MISS. This accuracy drop  can not only be incredibly infuriating, but also extremely  game-changing. One untimely miss can mean the end. In addition, Zweilous  is slow as balls, and although decently bulky with Eviolite, it still  can't take super effective hits. It is weak to many common attack types,  such as Fighting, Ice, and Bug.</p>

<p>Zweilous functions extremely well under Trick Room conditions,  as its low Speed and great Attack allows it to make the most of it.  Zweilous can also pull off a successful Choice Scarf set that can  surprise its normal checks, although the 80% accuracy is still annoying  as ever. As one of the few Dragons in NU, use Zweilous to its  advantages, and you won't be missing out! Well, occasionally you will  miss... but that ain't my fault!</p>

<h4>Example Set</h4>

<p>Zweilous @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Hustle<br />
EVs: 236 HP / 252 Atk / 20 Spe<br />
Nature: Adamant (+Atk, -SpA)<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Fire Fang<br />
- Substitute / Dragon Tail</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>NFEs are very interesting choices to use in battle, and  although they mostly populate the lower tiers, they can surprise you by  being effective in some of the higher tiers. Just as their evolutions  are varied and diverse, NFEs can be anything from a wall to a sweeper to  both! Who knows? There is absolutely no limit as what you can do with  NFEs, as long as you are creative. In fact, if it weren't for several  individuals who were initially brave enough to try out these NFEs in  serious competitive play, we might never have seen the light of how  useful NFEs can actually be. The fact that a lot of them don't need an  Eviolite in order to be successful is a sign that they are viable in  their own right. Just because they are Not Fully Evolved doesn't mean  they are Not Freakin' Exceptional!</p>

<p>Although this article features quite a few NFEs, there are  many, many more that have not been discussed, but are perfectly viable.  Some of the more prominent ones include but are not limited to: Scyther,  Munchlax, Haunter, Duosion, Golbat, Tangela, Natu, Whirlipede, and  Gurdurr. This is just a taste of the actual number of viable NFEs; in  actuality there are dozens more, and perhaps some that haven't yet been  explored. So without further ado, stop reading and get out there! Try  these NFEs for yourself, and don't be smirking... Because I know you  won't be smiling when you get swept by a Pikachu.</p>
