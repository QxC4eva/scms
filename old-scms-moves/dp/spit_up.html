[SHORT DESC]
Varies in power depending on the number of uses of Stockpile.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Has 100 power if the user has used Stockpile once, 200 power if the user has used Stockpile twice, or 300 power if the user has used Stockpile thrice. After using Spit Up, all Stockpiles are lost. Spit Up always rolls 100/100 damage in the random damage part of the damage formula, meaning it does max damage. Spit Up only removes the defensive boosts gained by Stockpile. If a Pokemon uses Cosmic Power five times, then Stockpiles three times, after using Spit Up, the Pokemon will have +5 in both defenses.</p>
