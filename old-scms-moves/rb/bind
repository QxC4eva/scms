[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prevents the opponent from attacking for 2-5 turns. Either Pok√©mon may switch at any time, but the user is only permitted to use this attack until the 2-5 turns are up. Ghost-types do not receive damage, but they are still immobilized by Bind. If the target switches, the duration of this attack will be renewed and an additional PP will be used. If the user switches out, the target is still immobilized for the duration of that turn. All the hits will do the same damage as the first hit. If the first hit is a critical hit, all subsequent hits will be critical hits too.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>RBY partial trapping moves might be the most obnoxious moves ever. For its duration, the target will be able to switch but it won't be able to attack. This gives the user free switches and it slowly gets your health down until you are in Hyper Beam KO range. It's a move basically used to buy turns and win very, very slowly. You won't see Bind used much though, as Wrap has better accuracy.</p>
