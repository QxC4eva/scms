<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When held by a Pokemon, reduces the power of a damaging Fire-type move that would hit the holder for super effective damage by 50%. Consumed after use. Natural Gift becomes a 60 Base Power Fire-type attack when the user holds this Berry, but the Berry is consumed after use.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Occa Berry can be helpful for Pokemon who are weak towards Fire-type moves, such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, Escavalier, and Metagross. With an Occa Berry, these Pokemon can survive a potentially fatal attack and then strike back. However, the first three Pokemon have a 4x weakness towards Fire-type moves, and would still take severe damage. Ferrothorn would much prefer Leftovers than Occa Berry, and is still weak towards Fighting-types moves, and the other three would miss out on items such as Life Orb and Choice Band. In fast-paced metagames like VGC, Occa Berry is far more useful, as surviving even one attack can be crucial; however, in standard singles metagames, Occa Berry is not really worth it.</p>
