[SHORT DESC]
The user always moves first. Will only work if the foe attacks on the same turn.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a priority of +1. Fails if the target does not use a direct attacking move in the same turn, or if the target moves before the user.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sucker Punch is more powerful and more widely distributed than most other priority attacks, but it comes with a nasty side effect of failing if the opponent doesn't attack. Don't let that downside fool you, though; Sucker Punch is still extremely effective when used correctly. Quite a number of fast, hard-hitting, and problematic Pokemon, such as Gengar and Alakazam, fall easily to Sucker Punch. If you can predict your opponent's moves well, Sucker Punch can be a great source of coverage and a good primary STAB attack as well.</p>
