	<p>Hi!</p>

	<p>We hope you enjoyed this edition of The Smog.</p>

	<p>A lot of people seemed to notice the lack of an Editor's Note in the last issue. It might have seemed like I just forgot, but it was actually purposeful. The reason is simple: I didn't really have anything different or important to say, so why force it?</p>

	<p>You should also notice that our releases are getting more frequent. We're hoping that this change helps us to deliver content that is more relevant and serves to give everyone a more predictable time frame for each issue. This has the natural side effect of smaller issues, but we don't believe this is a bad thing; it also led to a new way of categorizing our content that we hope is more accurate and puts our most popular content front and center.</p>

	<p>As always, we'd like to thank our readers and <a href="contributors">contributors</a>.</p>

	<p>I think that's it for now. If you have questions or comments on the issue or any of these changes, feel free to head on over to the <a href="/forums/threads/3524562">release thread</a>, send an email to thesmog[at]smogon[dot]com, or message any of the staff directly.</p>

	<p>Thanks again!</p>

	<p>- Toast++</p>
