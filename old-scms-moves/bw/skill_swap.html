The user and the target trade abilities.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The user trades its ability with the target. Fails if either the user or the target's ability is Illusion, Multitype, or Wonder Guard, or if both have the same ability. When either Pokemon switches out or faints, the effect is lost on them only; on the other, the effect persists until it also switches out or faints. This move cannot be blocked by Substitute. If an ability would activate upon switching in, such as Intimidate, then it will activate again upon being Skill Swapped.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Skill Swap has next to no use in single battles, as giving up your Pokemon's ability for the enemy's can backfire extremely badly. Not to mention that most Pokemon with Skill Swap have great abilities in the first place. However, in doubles and triples, it allows Pokemon with awful abilities like Slaking and Regigigas to sweep teams after they swap their terrible abilities with their teammate's great ones. Skill Swap also has the benefit of only taking one turn to set up, and can even give the user of Skill Swap another weapon to use against the opponent should they acquire an ability like Truant from their teammate.</p>
