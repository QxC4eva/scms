<div class="aside">
<p>Hello it is me, Oglemi. AKA the OgleBOMB. AKA Notorious G.A.Y. Here bringing you yet another interview with some poor schlob.</p>

<p>My adventure began this time in hobunk Rhode Island, where I was told there was a particularly smarmy individual that needed to be taken down a peg. After accidentally driving all the way through the state twice and somehow ending up in Boston each time, I eventually found my victim playing Pok&eacute;mon on his 3DS on the upper floor of the Engineering building on the campus of what I assume to be the only college in the state.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>You ready for this?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>I mean I guess lol. Do you have questions prepared?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>Ye, and by ye I mean of course not, wtf do you think I am? But let's do it anyway.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>Ugh FINE. How does this work even?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>You tell me about yourself and I judge harshly.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>um OK. Do I just start whenever? Is this thing on?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>No, you must wait for me to ask the question, this isn't open mic. e.e</p>

<p>*clears throat*</p>

<p>OK tell me about yourself, who you are, why you matter in life, etc.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>I'm a civil engineering student in Rhode Island, which is roughly as exciting as it sounds. And uh I play Pok&eacute;mon sometimes? Sometimes.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>Are you out of the Pok&eacute;mon closet? And does your gf support your Pok&eacute; endeavors?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>Yeah, when I got to college I stopped caring about that because a lot of my friends did nerdy shit too. And yeah, my gf also plays Pok&eacute;mon but not nearly as srsly as I do.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>Why civil engineering? Do you want to someday be the person to complain to about my town's shitty road system or what exactly does that entail?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>Well I have much experience in being the de facto complaints box because of Smogon, so that helps. I'm more interested in the non-road side of civil engineering though. Mainly I chose it because structural engineering is pretty neat; it's mostly practical as opposed to theory-heavy majors, and when you get a job in it, your work is visible for a long time (if you do it right). The other reason I went into it is that yes, our country's infrastructure as a whole blows, so there's a pretty large need for civil engineers.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>Still sounds omega boring but to each his own I guess.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>Tell me a bit about Rhode Island. Is it all that Family Guy makes it out to be? Worse? Better? Is there a "everything is smaller in Rhode Island" joke?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>The joke is that "everybody knows everybody," and from my experience it's true; you can play 2 degrees of separation pretty much with anyone in the state lol. Also Rhode Islanders are absolutely terrible drivers in general, so uh, I guess Family Guy is accurate?</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>I hear Seth MacFarlane laughing maniacally in the distance.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>So tell me about Smogon, what brought you here, what made you leave, what brought you back, what made you leave again, and why HEAVAEN'T YOU STAYED AWAY</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>Oh boy, here we go.</p>

<p>Why I came here: DPP came out and I wanted info on the new games, then kinda stuck around. You can still see my wonderful spriting endeavors in Smeargle's Studio.</p>

<p>Why I left: I think the first time I left was like, 2009? I was just kinda burnt out with CAP, a lot of the old regulars were leaving.</p>

<p>Why I came back again: BW NU was starting and I really enjoyed the tier, so I started playing a lot and posting.</p>

<p>Why I left for the second time: I was going through a lot of shit personally; I nearly failed out of college and I was really depressed. I quit cold turkey for about 6 months.</p>

<p>Why I came back AGAIN: Fuck if I know man, I never left IRC and social media on Smogon was just starting to be a thing again with darkie leading it. I really enjoyed interacting with people outside of the site but who were still pkmn fans, so I did that for a while.</p>

<p>Why haven't I stayed away: I've been on here so long that it's hard to leave your friends. I started in 2007 when I was 14, I'm 21 turning 22 by the time this issue goes out now. I grew up with the site in a lot of ways, and I'm pretty happy right now on it.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>I jerk awake at the end of the riveting tale and quickly shuffle through my notes to think of something else to say.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>Tell me about your friends here on the site, have you met up with any of them and what was that like?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>lol the list is way too long. I've met a ton of Smogoners both on my own and through VGC tournaments. The one thing that's weird is you have to pick which name to call someone by in person, either their irl name or their username.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>I can't imagine someone choosing to call please vm dicks and i will reciprocate his username over irl name.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>Probably my favorite "meetup" was at VGC Worlds this year in DC since I was actually of legal age.</p>

<p>Most memorable was when Wildeep got pooped on while we were having lunch in Boston.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>Probably deserved it.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>Best experience was probably losing in the LCQ at Worlds then immediately going and getting blasted over dinner with JabbaTheGriffin and mingot.</p>

<p>I don't think I've had a worst experience? Everyone I've met has been really nice and fun to hang out with. It's like an extension of IRC.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>So tell me about what you've done for Smogon and a little about social media.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>I think the only parts of the site where I really haven't participated at one time or another are RMT and OI. Obviously, I'm more known for some things than others, being one of the leaders of CAP in DPP, leading BW NU tier and C&amp;C, and now social media. The most "fun" was probably leading NU; it was a good group of people in a really fun tier. Social media is different though. A lot of it is off-Smogon, which means I get to interact with a lot of different kinds of people than just "competitive players" that you find on Smogon. Our ruleset has a lot larger reach than I think people realize.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>Social Media has come a long way, where do you see it going from here?
</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>Yeah it's definitely come a long way. We started our social media endeavors in earnest a lot later than other parts of the site. However, it's a very effective way to disseminate information. I think we have more Facebook likes than users on the forum now, for instance. In the future I'd like to find easier ways for users to contribute to our media outlets, make it more personal. People have responded really well to giveaways and T-shirts and such, there's definitely going to be more of that.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>An image of chaos lording over a bunch of Smogon swag flashes in my mind.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>Alright, tell me about SPL. You are the last remaining original manager in the tournament. What about the Tigres keeps you on board every year?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>Yeah I'm the only original manager left (makiri started in spl2). The thing I like about managing in SPL is that I get to interact with a bunch of users that I normally wouldn't get a chance to since I've never been big into tournaments. It's also fun for the same reason fantasy football is fun. You can make a team up of great players in each tier and see how they stack up vs other teams. n_n</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>Where did loooooooooooos tigres come from?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>I think it was like SPL 2. I saw NBA teams were wearing jerseys in Spanish, like los spurs or los suns. Originally it was "el tigres" but that's grammatically incorrect, thus: los tigres. It's handy since the full name of the team is longer than any other team name.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>Tell me about the current season, how do you think it's going so far? Any players standing out to you/making a splash on your own team and others?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>Well at the time of this interview we're 1-2. The first couple of weeks were rough since a lot of luck didn't bounce our way, but last week we won big and lived up to what people expected from our team pre-season.</p>

<p>Ummm, if I had to choose someone I'm really impressed with it's Jabba, and Floppy too. Both have been amazing teammates in testing matches and always supporting other tigres and they've played damn well too lol. Floppy unfortunately got rby'd a couple times, but whatcha gonna do? Really though, I like everyone on my team. If I didn't I wouldn't have drafted them lol.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>OK I think we can end the interview with: What's your favorite mon?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>UGH I HATE THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I HAVE TO CHOOSE JUST ONE. I would say Raikou but I've been SRing it for about a month now, so uh probably Slowbro, because it's slow and a bro, of which I am both.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue38/avatar-oglemi.png" alt="" />
<p>slowfratboybro imo</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker tennisace">
<img src="/smog/issue40/interview_tennisace.png" alt="" />
<p>FRAT</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>And with that we bounce and hit the town for a night of Slowbro-level drinking. Until the next interview.</p>
