<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 10% chance to boost the user's Defense by one stage.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>While a Defense boost may seem like a valuable asset, Steel Wing's low accuracy and an only 10% chance to get that boost make it unreliable. Furthermore, Steel Wing is discouraged due to Steel's terrible offensive coverage.</p>
