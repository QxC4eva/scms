[SHORT DESC]
Will OHKO the target.

[LONG DESC]
<p>Does damage equal to the target's max HP. If the target uses Endure, it will leave them with 1 HP. If Lock-On or Mind Reader has been used the previous turn, Horn Drill will hit. Horn Drill ignores all other Accuracy and Evasion modifiers, but instead has its own accuracy formula.

Accuracy = ((Uâ€”T) + 30) / 100

U = Level of the user
T = Level of the target

Horn Drill fails if the user's level is less than the target's level.
