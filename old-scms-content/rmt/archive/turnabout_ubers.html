<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I have been using this team since around March, and it has easily been my most successful team yet. This team is centered around Wobbuffet, and his ablilty to easily set up Lucario. I honestly thought this team was not going to work when I made it, as it has 3 set up sweepers, and I really do not check a lot of Pokemon directly. However, This team was sucessful enough to get me up to #4 on the ladder when I was actually laddering, and other players have also used this team succesfuly. I am posting this team because I want some last minute advice before I retire this team, as I really want to test new Pokemon in Ubers. I also named each Pokemon after Ace Attorney characters, because I found a funny sprite that made Lucario look like Phoenix Wright.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p><strong>Deoxys-S</strong> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Shadow Ball</p>

<p>Ah, the standard suicide lead in todays Metagame. I choose Deoxys-Speed because as can be seen, this team really likes the support of Stealth Rocks and Spikes. If I see those pesky Darkrai leads, I often switch to Wobbuffet so they are locked into Dark Void, thus they are forced to struggle to death. If they Dark Pulse, I will switch Wobbuffet out and go to Lucario, who can do some serious damage to the next switch in with Close Combat. I have given Deoxys-S Shadow Ball just in case I lose the speed tie, so then this way I can 2HKO them. For most other leads I have encounterd, I just simply get down Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. I named him after Apollo Justice because… I didn’t have another Pokemon to name after him =/</p>

<p><strong>Wobbuffet</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Shadow Tag<br />
EVs: 28 HP / 252 Def / 230 SpD<br />
Bold Nature<br />
- Counter<br />
- Mirror Coat<br />
- Encore<br />
- Safeguard</p>

<p>Wobbuffet is key to this teams success. Wobbuffet has several jobs that no other Pokemon can do for this team. Wobbuffet can often set up one of my sweepers by encoring moves such as Earthquake (though Life Orb Groudon’s hurt a hell of a lot). Wobbuffet will also revenge kill Scarfed Pokemon that attempt to stop Lucario’s sweep, such as Choice Scarf Dialga. Additionally, Wobbuffet can easily set up Giratina-o when I’m against stall teams, and rip them to shreds! Setting up Lucario is very easy with Wobbuffet, because Lucario has 4x resists to Bug and Dark, and sports a 2x resist to Ghost, all of which are Wobbuffet’s weaknesses. I choose Bold over Calm because this team does not have a direct way to deal with Rock Polish Groudon, thus Wobbuffet can act as a make shift revenge killer to that if I let it set up (which is not often). I named Wobbuffet after Trucy Wright, because she is Phoenix Wrights duaghter, and Wobbuffet supports him quite well. (Lucario is Phoenix Wright)</p>

<p><strong>Giratina-O</strong> @ Griseous Orb<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 144 HP / 236 SpA / 18 SpD / 112 Spe<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Substitute</p>

<p>Giratina-o is one of the most under rated Ubers, and it is also a very important Pokemon in this team. As some people know, Forretress ruins Deoxys-s suicide leads by Rapid Spinning them. It was a major inconvinece to this team, as I orignially had Rayquaza in this place. Meanwhile, Giratina takes a long time to set up if I opt to use a Calm Mind Rest Talk set, and this team really needed a Ground immunity. Thus, I tired out a Sub Calm Mind Giratina-o, as this team really needed an offensive spin blocker. Giratina-o has been the best offenisve spin blocker I have ever used. Giratina-o easily switches into Forretress, and can set up Calm Minds and a Subtitiute to become an increadbly hard to stop sweeper. If Forretress dares to use Payback, then I switch to Lucario and get a free Swords Dance. Giratina-o can also set up a Substitute when Wobbuffet encores a support Groudon's Earthquake. </p>

<p>Giratina-o has the nice bonus of resisting all of Lucario's weaknesses, thus if someone tries to revenge kill Lucario by using Choice Scarf Dialga, I can switch into the Aura Sphere or Fire Blast, and let Giratina-o get free set up time. Most of all, Giratina-o can smash through stall teams, espcially when paried with Wobbuffet. Most stall teams only hope against Giratina-o is Latias. when Latias is eleimanted (usally by Lucario), most stall teams are doomed. Thanks to Levitate, Giratina-O is not effected by Toxic Spikes; thanks to the ghost typing, Blissey needs Ice Beam to even do much damage (it can't even break susbistutes after one Calm Mind), and Shadow Ball rips through Lugia. </p>

<p>The evs were taken from the analysis. Giratina-o's evs allow it to out speed a Jolly Tyranitar (trust me this is for a good reason) and base 90 speed Ubers that don't invest in speed. The HP and Special Defense EVs allow Giratina to survive a Timid Palkia's Spaciel Rend, even after Stealth Rock! I have been consdering making Griatina-o Timid with enough speed to out run and Kill both Adamant Rayquaza and Adamant Lucario. I am not sure if this is worth losing the bulk Giratina-o has to offer though. I named Giratina-o after Mia Fey, as they are both ghostly =D.</p>

<p><strong>Groudon</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Drought<br />
EVs: 112 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Def / 136 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Rock Polish<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Dragon Claw<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>Rock Polish Groudon works qutie nicely on this team, despite it argubly being the "weakest link" so to speak. After a Rock Polish, Groudon reaches an amazing 500 speed, out speeding even Jolly Choice Scarf Garchomp. Groudon is also the closest thing I have to a "Rayquaza check", its very shakey though, as a 2+ Dragon Claw from an adamant Rayquaza with Life Orb can still KO after Stealth Rock. Addtionally, Groudon provides a useful Elecrtic immuntiy, allowing me to set up on Choice Specs Kyogre's stuck on Thunder. Rock Polish Groudon is nearly unstopable with Stealth Rock and Spikes, as he is often able to KO damn near every offenisve Pokemon (except for oposing Groudons) in the tier after that support. The only commonly seen Pokemon that even have a chance of out speeding Groudon after the boost are Choice Scarf Mewtwo, Choice Scarf Darkrai, and Deoxys-s. Wobbuffet will easily revenge kill Mewtwos that Ice Beam Groudon, and Lucario can set up on Choice Scarf Darkrai. Deoxys-s is almost only seen as a suicide lead, thus I never have to worry about it. I named Groudon after Edgeworth because he is my other physical sweeper, and is also red like Edgeworths suit.</p>

<p><strong>Palkia</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Pressure<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Surf<br />
- Spacial Rend<br />
- Fire Blast<br />
- Thunder</p>

<p>Palkia is the only real attempt to directly check any Pokemon, thus it is an important part of the team. Choice Scarf Palkia can out speed Darkrai, and revenge kill it. it can also outspeed Dragon Dance Rayquaza, who can easliy sweep this team without Palkia. Most of all, Palkia can live through Kyogre's Water Spout, thus I can force it or kill it with Thunder. I have to keep Palkia in hidding early game, because thanks to Wobbuffet's increased popularity, Palkia can be easily revenge killed. Unfortnatly, Palkia has a very hard time dealing with Swords Dance Rayquaza and Lucario, thus I have been considering investing in Palkia's defenses. I'm not sure if this is a good idea, so I need some advice on this. I named Palkia after Maya Fey because I thought naming Palkia after Pearl was too obvious.

<p><strong>Lucario</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Inner Focus<br />
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Swords Dance<br />
- Extremespeed<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Crunch</p>

<p>Lucario is the star of the show! After a Swords Dance, Lucario has enough power to become a terror, even in the Uber tier! With Stealth Rock and Spikes support, Lucario has KOed most Kyogre, Rayquaza, Darkrai, Mewtwo and Palkia with a 2+ Extremespeed. Most Offensive Groudons are OHKOed by Close Combat, meanwhile Lucario has destrosied most support Groudons when they are under 70%. Lucario also 2HKOs Giratina with a 2+ Crunch, who will often not be able to Willowisp me thanks to Wobbuffet's Safeguard. Lugia is also screwed if it lacks refelct, as it is also 2HKOed. Even Roost won't save it, as defense drops will often kick in eventully. Forretress is also often OHKOed by a 2+ Close Combat. </p>

<p>Now, I am sure some people are going to say "Why aren't you using Swords Dance Rayquaza instead?" There are a two main reasons for this. First and formost is Lucario's wonderful typing. Thanks to his Lucario's Fighting and Steel typing, Lucario only takes around 3% from switching in to Stealth Rock. This can be helpful, as it allows me to use Lucario to revenge Pokemon that are at low HP in emergencies. Lucario's typing also provides a useful set of reisitsances that work well with the team. For example, Lucario resists all of Wobbuffet's and Giratina-o's weaknesses, thus Wobbuffet can easily set up Lucario. Addtionally, Giratina-O can often switch into the assualts Choice Scarf Dialga trys to KO Lucario with (Aura Sphere and Fire Blast), and use the time to set up a Subistute thanks to its handy reistances. Lucario can also sweep weakened teams by use Swords Dance on a weakned Choice Scarf Palkia's Spcecail Rend, which is something that Rayquaza could never do (it does a massive 50% though). Choice Scarf Darkrais are easily set up on thanks to Lucario's 4x resistance to Dark Pulse. </p>

<p>Secondly, Close Combat is extremly powerful. In fact, Lucario's Close Combat does more than Rayquaza's Dragon Claw after a Swords Dance! thus, Groudon can not just come in and destroy me unless it has a heavy defensive investment, and if it does then I switch to to Wobbuffet to set up Giratina-o.</p>
