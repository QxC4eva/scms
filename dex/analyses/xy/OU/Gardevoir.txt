Overview
########
- Gardevoir has a great Special Attack and strong special bulk, which is even better in Mega forme.
- Decent Psychic / Fairy typing allows Gardevoir to take on plenty of threats.
- It has an excellent movepool both offensively and in support, so it is very versatile.
- It can cover many threats with its coverage moves.
- Extremely vulnerable on the physical side, so it will fold to literally any physical attack which is not good in a metagame filled with priority and physical attackers.
- Pixilate Hyper Voice bypassing Subs is great to handle Kyurem-B, Gliscor, and Baton Pass teams.
- 80 Speed prior to Mega Evolving is lackluster for an offensive Pokemon.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Hyper Voice
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Hidden Power Ground / Focus Blast
move 4: Taunt / Will-O-Wisp
item: Gardevoirite
ability: Trace
nature: Timid
evs: 24 Def / 232 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Hyper Voice provides a strong, reliable Fairy STAB move that smashes Dragons; with Pixilate the move hits very hard.
- Psyshock hits past Blissey, Venusaur, and Scolipede while also getting good neutral coverage against Talonflame.
- Hidden Power Ground hits Heatran, two common Pokemon who resist Hyper Voice.
- Focus Blast provides a powerful coverage move to maul Ferrothorn and to a smaller extent hitting Scizor hard.
- Taunt is useful to stop status moves and also makes Gardevoir a good stallbreaker. It operates especially well against teams reliant on Venusaur-Chansey cores.
- Will-O-Wisp is a cool move to surprise common switch-ins such as Scizor, while patching up Gardevoir's poor physical defense.
- Calm Mind though is usable if you want more special bulk and power.
- Hidden Power Fire could be used if you're really scared of Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Scizor, but beyond that is very situational.
- Substitute is also pretty decent to block status and avoid potential revenge kill attempts.

Set Details
========
- Trace is a good ability for non Mega Gardevoir, as it can trace things like Klefki's Prankster, Dragonite's Multiscale, and Heatran's Flash Fire before evolving. 
- The EV spread allows gives Gardevoir the most power and Speed possible while being able to survive at least two Psyshocks from Latios to make a better check to it.

Usage Tips
========
- This set is a great tool against offense and stall, using its power and coverage to pester opponents and break down walls.
- Trace is a useful ability to switch in as is its typing, and you can then activate Mega Gardevoir to start spamming Hyper Voice.
- This set should be used as a supporting attacker for other sweeping teammates, since it's not exactly fast enough to clean or sweep on its own.

Team Options
========
- Heatran can take on Steel-types and Talonflame while setting up Stealth Rock.
- Talonflame can handle most Steels
- Fighting-types such as Terrakion help Gardevoir fight against specific Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Moonblast
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Healing Wish / Trick
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Trace
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

Moves
========
- Moonblast is Gardevoir's most reliable Fairy STAB, which provides good coverage.
- Focus Blast is there for Ferrothorn and Heatran.
- Healing Wish though can be used for quick suicide if Gardevoir is no longer useful, and healing a weakened teammate is always very helpful.
- Trick though is nice to pester walls like Blissey and Skarmory. However, be cautious about using it since it cannot swap with Pokemon holding Mega stones.
- Destiny Bond can bring a double down against something like Gengar.
- Memento is a good option over Healing Wish or Destiny Bond to provide something like Swords Dance Talonflame or Mega Scizor a nice setup opportunity.

Set Details
========
- Timid maximizes Speed to utilize Scarf with.
- Trace is just an amazing ability, copying certain abilities to provide good switch-in opportunities. Don't consider other abilities.

Usage Tips
========
- This set is a great revenge killer, being able to take on a number of fast offensive threats such as Greninja, Garchomp, Latios, Latias, and Thundurus. 
- Trace is a very good ability and you can use it to grab some very good abilities like Flash Fire or Multiscale.
- With Gardevoir's rare support options like Healing Wish, it can sacrifice itself to do a number of useful things.

Team Options
========
- Bisharp and Absol both make viable teammates, and both sport good offensive synergy with Gardevoir. Bisharp can also use Pursuit to harm pesky tanks and walls such as Chansey
- Fighting-types like Terrakion and Keldeo can handle Steel-types rather well.

Other Options
========
- Healing Wish / Memento can be used on non-Scarf sets to support the team, although Gardevoir is still a bit too slow and frail to do this.
- Hypnosis can potentially shut down any Pokemon, but suffers from very poor and unreliable accuracy.
- Psychic is outclassed by Psyshock and Moonblast as a STAB move, as it doesn't hit any notable targets harder aside from Mega Venusaur.
- Defensive sets are possible with Will-O-Wisp, Wish, and Heal Bell, but this is outclassed by Clefable, Sylveon, and Togekiss, all of whom sport higher HP and physical defense. 
- Choice Specs is usable, although Gardevoir's most-used attacks are fairly easy to switch into, and it's a little on the slow side.

Checks and Counters
========
- Scizor
- Excadrill 
- Talonflame
- Scolipede
- Special walls; namely Blissey and Chansey
- Any physical attacker that is faster; it's really frail on the physical side and its Speed isn't exactly amazing.
