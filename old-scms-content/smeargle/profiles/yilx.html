<h3>Who is Yilx?</h3>

<p>Hi. I'm Yilx. I like to draw. I'm not that very good, but I do my best. I lurked Smogon for the longest time before I actually started posting. I battle quite a bit too, but I am also not very good at that.</p>

<p>I draw Pokemon for fun most of the time, usually as a part of request though. One thing you might notice is I tend to draw "moemons" or sometimes "waifumons" a lot. Sorry if it is not your kind of thing! I am especially a fan of Lilligant and Meloetta-P. Not gonna go further than this, though; I hope you don't associate me with people who drool over them everyday.</p>

<p>I also tend to lend myself to making 'derpy' looking Pokemon look more badass because I am a fan of things being slightly out of character. I also like to draw the human characters from the Pokemon series, particularly Iris, Homika (now Roxie) and Maylene. I think they're the best pint-sized battlers around.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>

<p>I have drawn lots of things for The Smog and Smogon's Create-a-Pokemon Project. These are the two main projects on the site that I contribute to on a regular basis.</p>
