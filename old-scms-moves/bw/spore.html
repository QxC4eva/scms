<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Puts the target to sleep. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead use this move themselves. Pokemon with the abilities Insomnia or Vital Spirit are immune.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Spore is the only 100% accurate sleep inducing move in the game. With the new sleep mechanics in Black and White, Spore can be used to devastating effect, incapacitating your opponent and buying you time to either set up a Substitute or a stat boost. Breloom is arguably the best user, typically using Substitute while the opponent switches fearing a Spore, almost guaranteeing that Breloom will pull off a Spore. Smeargle is also a viable user; it can outspeed common slow walls and put them to sleep, allowing it to pull off several stat boosts and Baton Pass them to a teammate.</p>
