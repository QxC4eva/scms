Overview
########

Skarmory has always been a mixed bag in Ubers. It boasts the same Defense stat as Groudon and a unique and dangerous Steel / Flying defensive typing that gives it ten resistances and two immunities. Skarmory also has access to multiple entry hazards and, unlike many other Steel types, Skarmory boasts reliable recovery and the ability to shut down other hazard setters and defoggers on the switch-in with Taunt. Sturdy is another, situational benefit to using Skarmory-- the ability enables it to stay in versus something that could otherwise OHKO it such as Mega-Blaziken or Geomancy Xerneas at full health and proceed to phase it out or attack it. Skarmory even has decent versatility, being able to viably run both a specially defensive set to mess up support Arceus as well as a physically defensive set that walls a decent number of prominent Ubers even more effectively. However, all is not well for the Stygian bird--its unique defensive typing can also prove to be its downfall. While it may shut down some notable things such as Extremekiller Arceus, it is massively threatened by other physical attackers such as Ho-oh and Zekrom. Additionally, 65 HP / 70 SpD is simply too weak to sponge hits from the plethora of special attackers in Ubers; it goes without saying that a specially defensive spread alone will not let it check things like Kyogre, Arceus-Electric, and Palkia. On top of all this, Skarmory has lost its coveted Dark and Ghost resistances with the advent of generation six, so its specially defensive set's performance has suffered greatly. Though it has lost a lot of its versatility, it is still a stretch to call Skarmory unviable--it still succeeds at being possibly the best answer to Physical attackers like Extremekiller Arceus, Tyranitar, and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground in the game, and has gained the ability to wall new threats such as Mega-Kangaskhan and Mega-Mewtwo-X with ease. In spite of its flaws, Skarmory still manages to find a niche in Ubers, and tends to perform well more often than not when used properly.

Moves
========

The first slot is reserved exclusively for Roost--reliable recovery is one of Skarmory's main niches over other Steel types, and is absolute necessity for the Steelphoenix. The next slots, however, are not as straightforward. Toxic is ideal if Skarmory chooses to run Defog in place of an entry hazard, so it can better pressure Support Arceus (however, a specially defensive set, elaborated on below, is more ideal for this role). Taunt is best to pressure other hazard setters and Defog users on the switch-in if it should run hazards. Defog allows Skarmory to remove dangerous hazards such as Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes, which is good, as it is immune to both. Spikes are generally preferred to Stealth Rock due to this move's limited distribution in Ubers, but Stealth Rock is fine if it absolutely can not be fit anywhere else. The last slot is a tossup-- Whirlwind is key for phazing out Extremekiller Arceus so it cannot attain too many boosts. However, Brave Bird has legitimate use for hitting Mega-Mewtwo-X (which otherwise Taunts and shuts Skarmory down), and is nice as a last-ditch way to take down Mega-Blaziken. It also hits miscellaneous Pokemon like Scolipede and Amoonguss.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP and Defense allow Skarmory to better sponge attacks from the aforementioned Physical attackers. However, the only relevant thing such investment helps with is Extremekiller Arceus, which gains the ability to 2HKO 252 HP / 0 Def Skarmory with Silk Scarf equipped at +4 Attack. If this is not a concern, Skarmory can run a spread of 252 HP / 252 SpD, which lets it beat Defog Support Arceus in a one-on-one situation (this can be very useful in conjunction with an entry hazard such as Spikes). Bold is an option on Skarmory that do not run Brave Bird to reduce Foul Play damage. If it should carry that move, then just run an Impish nature. Regarding item choice, Shed Shell is ideal to escape Mega-Gengar, which can otherwise eliminate Skarmory not running Brave Bird. Do note, however, that with 12 Atk EVs, Brave Bird will 2HKO standard Mega-Gengar, meaning Skarmory can win if Mega-Gengar switches in on it or chooses to Taunt it first. Rocky Helmet is also a good item to help with Mega-Kangaskhan, Mega-Mewtwo-X, and Extremekiller Arceus, as well as getting chip damage on the random physical attackers that Skarmory loves to switch in on. Finally, Leftovers is an item that grants longevity to Skarmory, though it is not especially necessary for it.

Usage Tips
=========

Perhaps the most important thing to remember when using Skarmory is that it is not a special wall by any means. Even neutral Support Arceus' Judgment stands a good chance of 2HKOing it with just a little prior damage, so it must be played incredibly conservatively versus any special attacker with any power. However, what it loses in special bulk, it makes up for in massive physical bulk which rivals that of Groudon. It is often a great answer to bulky Ground types such as Landorus-Therian, Groudon and Hippowdon, easily Defogging, Taunting or setting hazards versus them. No other Steel type barring the uncommon Bronzong can accomplish this, and this is one of Skarmory's biggest niches over a Pokemon such as Mega-Scizor. There is not much else to say about Skarmory--play it to its strengths and it will not disappoint, but misuse it and it will faint far too fast to check anything that it needs to.

Team Options
==========

Due to its being forced out by some physical attackers and Zekrom unlike most Steel-types, Skarmory can be difficult to build around. It fits well alongside things that generally take special attacks such as Assault Vest Palkia, but be sure to have an answer to the aforementioned Zekrom. A non-steel type Xerneas check is also borderline mandatory to avoid overlap, so Ho-oh, Specially Defensive Roar Xerneas and Specially Defensive Kyogre can all make good teammates. Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Landorus-Therian are all appreciated for taking on Zekrom, Ho-oh, and Mega-Blaziken to some extent, as these things massively threaten Skarmory. Arceus-Water, especially its Calm Mind variant makes a good teammate due to its ability to beat Kyogre, Ho-oh, Palkia, and Mega-Blaziken for it, while Skarmory can compensate for the lack of a support Arceus by providing Defog and checking opposing Swords Dance Arceus. Arceus-Electric is in a similar boat, but it trades the ability to easily take on Mega-Blaziken for the ability to sponge Electric attacks for Skarmory and force out opposing Ho-Oh. Chople Berry Tyranitar is acceptable as a teammate, as it can pursuit-trap Mega-Gengar while Skarmory walls Hippowdon and Groudon for it, assuming the latter lacks a Fire move. Skarmory itself is more suited to Balance than Hyper Offense due to its lack of offensive presence and impressive synergy with the aforementioned Pokemon. However, it is ideal to pressure defoggers with teammates, especially with Spikes Skarmory, so running it on Offense is not entirely out of the question.

Other Options
########

Skarmory truly has a dearth of viable other options. Rock Slide is a possibility for damaging Ho-oh on the switch-in, but is pathetically weak and generally useless outside of this. Iron Head is listed simply because it should not be used-- Brave Bird is a better STAB move as it packs higher power and a generally better offensive typing, and Skarmory is not capable of taking on threats such as Geomancy Xerneas (unlike some of its Steel-type brethren). Counter can be a fun for OHKOing Ho-Oh and dishing out serious damage to opposing Extremekiller Arceus or anything that would knock Skarmory down to its Sturdy range with a physical attack, but Brave Bird and Whirlwind are generally more useful all-around. Custap Berry, Skarmory's best item for attempting to Suicide Lead last generation, is currently unobtainable, otherwise it would be listed as an option.

Checks & Counters
########
**Powerful special attackers**: It has been stressed many times, but Skarmory cannot hope to take on anything that can hit it powerfully from the special spectrum. Dialga, Kyogre, Palkia, 252 Satk Calm Mind Arceus, any Mewtwo with a Fire move, offensive Xerneas, Darkrai, and many others can immediately dispose of Skarmory.

**Taunt users**: Due to Skarmory's defensive nature, anything with access to the coveted move Taunt is phenomenal at shutting down Skarmory. Deoxys-Speed, Yveltal, Mega-Gengar (assuming Skarmory lacks Shed Shell), fast Gliscor, Whimsicott (assuming Skarmory lacks Brave Bird), Thundurus, Sableye, Stalltwo, and even opposing Skarmory will force out your own Skarmory with ease.

**Zekrom, Reshiram, Kyurem-White, and Kyurem-Black** These four Pokemon deserve a specially mention since they boast the ability to KO Skarmory through Sturdy due to their abilities, as well as greatly threaten the rest of its teammates.

**Physical Attackers with a type advantage** Blaziken, Mega-Blaziken, Victini, and Ho-oh are all capable of eliminating Skarmory with ease, though they must be wary of the rare Counter or Brave Bird in Blaziken's case. Ho-Oh deserves a special mention since it can set up a Substitute or just smash Skarmory with a powerful attack should it predict wrong.
