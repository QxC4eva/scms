[Overview]

<p>Ever since its introduction, Stunfisk has been made fun of for its design; it has been called a joke, a failure, and quite possibly one of the worst things Game Freak has ever made. However, when you look more closely at the electric flounder, you will see that this "joke" actually has potential. With excellent defensive stats of 109 / 84 / 99, Stunfisk can tank hits with ease. Additionally, because of its unique dual Electric and Ground typing, Stunfisk is capable of fending off some of the most common threats in the RU metagame. Although Stunfisk seems to be a decent defensive Pokemon, there are several outstanding flaws that seriously hinder its effectiveness. Its dual Electric and Ground typing, while giving it a useful resistance to Stealth Rock and Flying-type moves, also gives it weaknesses to the common Ice-, Water-, Ground-, and Grass-type attacks that pervade the RU tier. However, if you play your cards right Stunfisk is no joke.</p>

[SET]
name: Defensive Derp
move 1: Discharge / Thunderbolt

move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers

nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 192 Def / 64 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is arguably Stunfisk's best set, as with 109 / 84 / 99 defenses, Stunfisk can easily abuse a decent RestTalk set. In addition, this set is essentially one of the best Archeops counters in the metagame; it resists Acrobatics and Stone Edge, and it is not 2HKOed by U-turn or any other move it may carry save for Earth Power. Discharge is the most important STAB attack on this set due to its 30% paralysis rate; however, Thunderbolt can be used if you need the extra oomph. Scald is used because of its high burn rate and its ability to hit Ground-types, such as Sandslash and Steelix; Earth Power can be used instead, because of its decent coverage and power. Either way, however, this set is walled by Grass-types. Rest and Sleep Talk are vital to this set, as they provide Stunfisk with a semi-reliable form of recovery. While Stunfisk is asleep, it can still potentially fire off attacks via Sleep Talk, which can be a lifesaver. The listed EV spread provides Stunfisk with balanced defenses, allowing it to tank both physical and special attacks well. The EVs can be adjusted to take certain attacks better; for example, specially defensive Stunfisk can tank a Life Orb Fire Blast from Moltres.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If you don't like the idea of using the RestTalk strategy, Pain Split is an option as a pseudo-recovery move that also drains away the opponent's health. It also frees up a moveslot, which can be used for a status move, such as Yawn or Toxic, or another coverage move, such as Scald or Earth Power. Stunfisk likes teammates that resist its weaknesses; Pokemon with abilities such as Water Absorb and Sap Sipper work well with Stunfisk because they benefit from Stunfisk's weaknesses. Pokemon such as Sawsbuck, Bouffalant, and Poliwrath are all excellent abusers of these abilities. However, even when running RestTalk, Toxic is still an option over one of Stunfisk's attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Surf
move 4: Sludge Bomb / Hidden Power Fire
item: Choice Specs
ability: Static
nature: Modest
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite having only a base 81 Special Attack, Stunfisk makes a great user of Choice Specs. The listed moves give excellent coverage, and they all hit surprisingly hard. This variant of Stunfisk also makes an excellent lure to walls, such as Sandslash, who try to switch in on Thunderbolt, only to get hit by a super effective Surf. Likewise, Grass-types, which usually wall Stunfisk, switch in only to get hit by a super effective Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Fire. This set is an excellent wallbreaker, as it 2HKOes most walls with hazard support. In addition, even without investment, it has good natural bulk, which allows it to take a hit or two before striking back. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Hidden Power Fire or Sludge Bomb, but its usage will be limited to targets that are 4x weak to Ice-type attacks, such as Altaria and Torterra, as a neutral Thunderbolt is stronger than a super effective Hidden Power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Using a Life Orb allows to switch moves, but Stunfisk loses its precious bulk, as well as the power to 2HKO certain walls, such as physically defensive Ferroseed and Uxie. Expert Belt is in a similar vein, as Stunfisk loses power against threats that it can't hit for super effective damage. Again, Stunfisk works well with Pokemon that resist its weaknesses, namely Pokemon who have abilities such as Water Absorb and Sap Sipper. Discharge can be used over Thunderbolt for the paralysis rate, allowing Stunfisk to potentially paralyze and outspeed a faster threat, but on a Specs set, the power of Thunderbolt is preferred. Here are some damage calculations of Stunfisk vs. some common walls:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thunderbolt vs. 252 / 252 Slowking: 64.47% - 76.14% (2HKO)</li>
<li>Thunderbolt vs. 252 / 0 Uxie: 41.81% - 49.44% (Chance of 2HKO after Stealth Rock)</li>
<li>Sludge Bomb vs. 252 / 0 Tangrowth: 100.99% - 119.31% (OHKO)</li>
<li>Earth Power vs. 252 / 0 Ferroseed: 46.23% - 54.45% (2HKO)</li>
<li>Earth Power vs. 252 / 160 Steelix: 114.12% - 134.46% (OHKO)</li>
</ul>

[Other Options]

<p>Stunfisk can pull off a Curse set, but it is sorely outclassed by Pokemon such as Muk. Substitute can be used to protect Stunfisk from status and stronger attacks, but due to its low Speed, it is better off to simply attack. Thunder Wave can be used to paralyze something, but Stunfisk is usually better off using Discharge due to its 30% paralysis rate. Yawn can be used to put something to sleep, but it is unreliable, and in general, is a terrible move.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Grass-types can easily take anything outside of a Sludge Bomb, and will heavily dent the flounder with a Power Whip or Giga Drain. Bulky Pokemon with a reliable recovery move give the defensive set trouble, as an uninvested Stunfisk has a somewhat low damage output. Munchlax walls both variants of Stunfisk, but it can't do much else to Stunfisk besides PP stall and phaze it out. Quagsire can switch in on a Thunderbolt and take an uninvested Earth Power or Scald, but it struggles against the Choice Specs set. The defensive Stunfisk set is vulnerable to Pokemon such as SubCM Uxie and Gallade, thanks to its relative lack of power. Even though Stunfisk is very bulky, strong attacks such as Bouffalant's Head Charge will still hit it very hard.</p>
