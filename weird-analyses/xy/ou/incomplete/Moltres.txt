Overview
########
While Fire / Flying typing offers an unattractive 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, it also provides an array of resistances which, when augmented by access to Hurricane backed by a great base 125 Special Attack stat, allows Moltres to fulfill both offensive and defensive roles for a team. Pressure and reliable recovery in Roost are handy for a defensive Pokemon, allowing Moltres to stall out Pokemon that it checks by virtue of its typing, such as Lucario, Scizor, Mega Mawile, and Conkeldurr. Offensively, Hurricane allows Moltres to 2HKO most of the OU tier; this wallbreaking power somewhat compensates for its relatively low Speed. Unfortunately, The Flame Pokemon is weak to common Water-, Electric-, and Rock-type attacks, which in tandem with the above-mentioned Stealth Rock vulnerability means that Moltres faces significant competition for a position on a team, both offensively and defensively.

SubToxic
########
name: SubToxic
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Roost
move 4: Flamethrower
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========
The combination of Substitute, Roost, and Toxic work excellently with Pressure to stall slower opponents. Substitute provides protection from status, which otherwise cripples Moltres, and is easy to set up thanks to Moltres's handy resistances. Any defensive Pokemon worth its salt loves a form of recovery; Roost provides this longevity for Moltres. Toxic is a great way to cripple common switch-ins, especially bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Jellicent, and finally Flamethrower is a decently strong STAB attack that has the added advantage of denting many Pokemon which don't mind Toxic, such as Steel-types, Mega Venusaur, Poison Heal Gliscor, and Celebi.

Set Details
========
The given EVs and Calm nature emphasize special bulk, allowing Moltres to check the likes of Aegislash, Alakazam, Landorus, and, importantly, Mega Charizard Y, while minimizing Stealth Rock damage. Leftovers is the item of choice for its useful HP restoration.

Usage Tips
========
This set is designed to stall out opposing Pokemon using passive damage from Toxic while keeping healthy with Roost. Try to set up a Substitute on Pokemon who cannot break it, such as Skarmory, or when you expect the opponent to switch out. A good scenario to use Substitute is if your Moltres is on the field against a Ferrothorn. If you're not safely behind a Substitute, it is wise to keep in mind that Toxic should nearly always be used to hit Water-types as they switch in, as they will force Moltres out otherwise. It is also important to remember that Pressure will double the PP used by moves used against Moltres, so it is feasible to stall out the PP of moves such as Stone Edge through the use of Substitute and Roost. Because Stealth Rock takes a huge 50% of HP upon switch-in, you should play cautiously when it is on the field, as using Substitute once before switching out will mean that Moltres is useful only as death fodder unless Stealth Rock is removed. Although this set is invested in Special Defense, you should recognize that Moltres's typing allows it to check physical attackers, too. Scizor and Conkeldurr can do very little outside of Knock Off. Ground-types such as Excadrill that lack a Rock-type coverage move are also completely shut down.

Team Options
========
Moltres is best suited to defensively inclined or balanced teams. In order for it to be effective, Defog or Rapid Spin support is a necessity; Excadrill has nice defensive synergy with Moltres and can demolish Tyranitar and Heatran with its STAB Earthquake. Mega Blastoise coves Moltres's Water-type vulnerability and Moltres can comfortably switch into Grass-type attacks aimed at Mega Blastoise. As far as Defog users go, Latios is an excellent choice, particularly variants carrying Earthquake, as it effectively lures and removes Heatran as well as dealing nice damage to Tyranitar. In terms of a defensive core, bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Gourgeist are great partners as they can switch into Electric- and Water-type moves. In return, Moltres can check Fire-type threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Teammates that can handle fast physical attackers such as Terrakion, Garchomp, and Talonflame are wise choices; Landorus-T and Rotom-W are effective in this pivot role and can often bring Moltres in safely with U turn and Volt Switch, respectively. Landorus-T can also set up Stealth Rock to wear down opposing Pokemon.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Hurricane
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Hidden Power Fighting / Hidden Power Ground
move 4: U-turn / Roost
ability: Pressure
item: Choice Specs / Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========
There are few moves that contain the sheer wallbreaking potential of Moltres's Hurricane. It has excellent neutral coverage as well as perfect accuracy under rain. Fire Blast is a similarly powerful secondary STAB attack that nails most Steel-types, notably Aegislash, which resist Hurricane. In the third slot, Hidden Power Fighting 2HKOes all variants of Tyranitar other than Assault Vest, and hits Heatran super effectively, while Hidden Power Ground is more specifically for Heatran, as it deals woeful damage to Tyranitar. U turn is ideal on Choice Specs sets for momentum and chip damage on predicted counters; Roost should only be used if Life Orb is the preferred item as it mitigates Stealth Rock damage and Life Orb recoil.

Set Details
========
Maximum Speed and Special Attack along with a Modest nature is ideal to provide the greatest firepower and wallbreaking potential, though Timid is viable in order to outrun Jolly Excadrill, Gyarados, Mild Kyurem-B, Jolly Mamoswine, and Timid Rotom-W. The boost afforded by Choice Specs is too attractive to pass up; with Choice Specs and a Modest nature Moltres can OHKO common threats such as Mega Charizard X, Garchomp, Latios, and Terrakion; it cannot OHKO these Pokemon without Choice Specs. If being locked into one move is unsatisfactory a Life Orb is useful for versatility, though recoil damage and the slight drop in power is often undesirable.

Usage Tips
========
Use Moltres's powerful STAB moves to break down opposing walls; U turn should only be used if your opponent has a counter to Moltres. Most of the time you will be best served by choosing an appropriate STAB attack. Tyranitar has the potential to trap Moltres with Pursuit, especially with Stealth Rock on the field. As such, if your opponent has a healthy Tyranitar on their team it is often best to use U turn until you scout what set it is in order to know when Hidden Power Fighting will KO it. As this set has no defensive investment, avoid switching directly into strong attacks unless they are resisted hits.

Team Options
========
Rain support is necessary to give Hurricane perfect accuracy, therefore Politoed is a mandatory partner. Hazard-removal support is a similarly vital requirement; Starmie is a decent choice as it also threatens many of Moltres's offensive checks including Keldeo, Terrakion, and Thundurus. Moltres can easily take Bug- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Starmie, as well as defeat Celebi and Ferrothorn. Be aware that using Starmie amplifies an Electric-type weakness, though. Defog Latios packing Earthquake is a great lure for Heatran and Tyranitar, as well as Aegislash, potentially damaging it to the point where it is 2HKOed by Hurricane. Terrakion is an excellent partner as it can smash Tyranitar, Heatran, and Chansey with its STAB Close Combat. Bisharp is a nice offensive check to Tyranitar, and can threaten Aegislash and Chansey with Knock Off as well as deal solid damage to the latter with Pursuit. Moltres's U turn can often bring Bisharp in safely against these Pokemon. Tornadus-T can form a nice Hurricane core with Moltres and can also lure and defeat mutual checks with Superpower. Finally, Moltres's U turn is an excellent tool that can bring in Dugtrio to trap and remove Heatran and Tyranitar.

Other Options
########
Moltres has access to several useful options at its disposal, such as Will-O-Wisp and Roar, which could potentially be used over Substitute and Toxic on the defensive set. This allows Moltres to counter Mega Mawile and prevent dangerous opponent from setting up, such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Mega Gyarados. Defog is possibly viable, though Moltres struggles to find space for it in its moveset, and will often have to switch into Stealth Rock in order to use Defog, so hazard removal is best left to teammates. Offensively, Moltres could utilize an Agility set, but setting up can be tough and often Moltres is better served by using its opportunities to fire off powerful attacks rather than to attempt a sweep. Finally, alternate moves such as Flamthrower, Overheat, and Air Slash are options over Fire Blast and Hurricane, though nearly always inferior choices.

Checks & Counters
########
**Stealth Rock**: As it removes 50% of health upon switch-in, if Stealth Rock is up, Moltres cannot counter many of the threats it otherwise could, and is far more prone to being revenge killed.

**Special Walls**: Tyranitar, Heatran, Chansey, and Blissey easily take Moltres's STAB moves. CHoice Specs HP Fighting does not 2HKO Assault Vest Tyranitar, while Scarf variants always live one and retaliate with Stone Edge or Pursuit. Tyranitar doesn't like Will-O-Wisp, though. Specially defensive Heatran is not 2HKOed by HP Fighting, and can lay down Stealth Rock or cripple Moltres with Toxic, although it must be wary of HP Ground. Blissey and Chansey can take any hit comfortably, heal potential burns with Natural Cure and ruin Moltres with status. Assault Vest Goodra is not 2HKOed by Specs Hurricane and can retaliate with powerful attacks. Sylveon also takes less than 50%, and can heal with Wish. Rotom-W resists Moltres's dual STAB and can hit back with Hydro Pump or Volt Switch.

**Steel-types in Rain**: Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi can switch into Hurricane, and though they are 2HKOed by Fire Blast, being locked into Fire Blast under rain is generally not a great situaution for Moltres.

**Pokemon that don't fear Flamethrower + Toxic**: Tentacruel and Magic Guard Clefable can't be worn down with Toxic and take little damage from Flamethrower. Lum Berry and Substitute users that resist Flamethrower such as Garchomp and Gyarados can set up a Sub that defensive Moltres cannot immediately break.

**Faster Pokemon**: Naturally faster Pokemon with super effective moves make for good checks. Keldeo, Terrakion, Starmie, and Thundurus are good examples here. Swift Swim users such as Kingdra can take advantage of Moltres's rain support and OHKO with powerful attacks.
