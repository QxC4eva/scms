<p>This is one of the teams that I have been using recently. It features some fairly unusual sets and shows how certain sets have become viable with the addition of new items. I feel that this team is a superb example of the Little Cup metagame, as it was at the time of posting. This team shows how Evolution Stone has completely changed the metagame, shifting from a Hyper Offensive one, to one in which stall and balanced teams (like this one) can flourish alongside Hyper Offense.</p>
 
<p><img src="/media/smog/14/lcteamstyles_frillish.png" /><br />
Pururiru (F) @ Evolution Stone<br />
Trait: Water Absorb<br />
EVs: 236 HP / 196 Def / 76 SDef<br />
Calm Nature (+SDef, -Atk)<br />
- Will-O-Wisp<br />
- Surf<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Recover</p>
 
<p>I lead with this Pok√©mon in Team Preview, and I often end up leading with it. There is not much that can take on Pururiru without fear of being burned / stalled to death. With access to Recover, it can heal off what minimal damage it receives and hit back with STAB Shadow Ball and Surf. With Evolution Stone, Pururiru hits 25 / 21 / 24 defences, which is absolutely insane. In terms of how I play Pururiru, I actually play it quite offensively, and am willing to sac it in order to get damage up on something I don't like, Misdreavus for example.</p>
 
<p>I don't Particularly see the need to run Boiling Water, as I have Will-O-Wisp, so the drop in power is quite pointless. Pururiru also provides the opportunity for many free switch ins, with its multitude of resistances.</p>

Zuruggu (M) @ Evolution Stone<br />
Trait: Shed Skin<br />
EVs: 36 HP / 156 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SDef / 212 Spd<br />
Jolly Nature (+Spd, -SAtk)<br />
- Dragon Dance<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Crunch</p>
 
<p>I run Zuruggu to give this team some offensive presence. Otherwise, I would be running gay-ass stall. Zuruggu also provides the team with a win condition, should all else fail. Once it sets up, Zuruggu is nigh impossible to stop, especially when it gets to +2, which does actually happen quite frequently. Some of Zuruggu's counters, in particular, Kojofuu are quite troublesome to the rest of the team, so I do switch Zuruggu out to Diglett and Pururiru quite regularly. This is my favourite Zuruggu set. Instead of aiming to set up and sweep straight away, its bulk allows it to get multiple boosts amd sweep until its heart's content.</p>

Tentacool (M) @ Evolution Stone<br />
Trait: Clear Body<br />
EVs: 196 HP / 76 Def / 36 SAtk / 196 Spd<br />
Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Rapid Spin<br />
- Toxic Spikes<br />
- Surf<br />
- Giga Drain</p>
 
<p>Tentacool is here to do 3 things. Set up Toxic Spikes, remove opposing Hazards, and act as death fodder; usually in that order. This team doesn't really like passive damage, but it does like inflicting it. As one of the fastest users of Rapid Spin and Toxic Spikes in the Little Cup metagame, Tentacool is perfect as a utility Pokemon. Toxic Spikes allows Lickitung to build up damage on the opposing team instead of just sitting there looking fat. The EVs give Tentacool both bulk and some power, which are needed for it to pull of its job</p>

<p>I run Giga Drain over Sludge Bomb or Slime Wave to hit unsuspecting Water-types (like Slowpoke) on the switch and heal off any damage that I receive.</p>

Lickitung (M) @ Evolution Stone<br />
Trait: Cloud Nine<br />
EVs: 196 HP / 156 Def / 156 SDef<br />
Careful Nature (+SDef, -SAtk)<br />
- Dragon Tail<br />
- Curse<br />
- Rest<br />
- Sleep Talk</p>
 
<p>My pride and joy. This team needed something to deal with weather, and I don't like Swablu. Enter, Lickitung. This is the bulkiest Pokemon in Little Cup, it makes Bronzor and Tesshiido look like little girls. Kojofuu Hi Jump Kick only 2HKOs preboost. The idea is to come in against something that can't do anything to you (ie anything that isn't fighting type) and Curse, Curse, Curse. This makes Lickitung impenetrable on the physical side of the spectrum. The EVs, take care of the special side of the spectrum and make Lickitung as bulky as possible. Rest provides much needed recovery, whilst Sleep Talk allows it to actually do something. The crux of the set is Dragon Tail. Pokemon like Zuruggu try to set up on Lickitung, only to be forced to switch out, whilst poisoned due to TSpikes and damaged due to being attacked. Unlike Licki's STAB, no Pokemon is immune to it and one can simply spam it to rack up damage.</p>
 
<p>With all that being said, there are some issues with this set: Meditite and Leech Seed. Meditite's enormous Attack stat means that a Hi Jump Kick will OHKO Lickitung, which isn't really an issue because of Murkrow. Leech Seed however, is the only form of passive damage that Lickitung can't Rest off, and the constant damage is very annoying. Tesshiido is really the case in point, which is why I run Zuruggu (who sets up on it.)</p>
 
<p>It is also worth noting, that this set hard counters stall, which can do nothing to it.</p>

<p>In my opinion this is the ultimate weather counter, and one of the best sets in the Little Cup metagame.
Whilst I would like to be running Wish and Protect over Rest and Sleep Talk, Wish is illegal with Cloud Nine, however, this may be a good set with Own Tempo as well.</p>

Diglett (M) @ Life Orb<br />
Trait: Arena Trap<br />
EVs: 240 Atk / 240 Spd<br />
Hasty Nature (+Spd, -Def)<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Shadow Claw<br />
- Rock Slide<br />
- HP Ice</p>
 
<p>Diglett allows me to trap whatever is pissing me off, and kill it with its enormous speed. The moves allow for maximum coverage and power, hitting a large amount of Pokemon for super effective damage. I don't use Sucker Punch, because I don't like having to predict. Diglett is one of the most important members of the team, as it allows me to outspeed, trap and KO many Pokemon that give this team trouble. Earthquake is for STAB, Shadow Claw for the omnipresent Ghosts, Rock Slide for Flying and Ice-types and HP Ice for Gligar. I use Diglett predominantly as my revenge killer. I also use it as a lead if I think the opponent's team can't handle it.
Diglett acts as my check to both Misdreavus and Murkrow, both of whom might cause trouble to this team with out him.</p>

Murkrow (M) @ Evolution Stone<br />
Trait: Mischievous Heart<br />
EVs: 196 HP / 100 Def / 180 SDef<br />
Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)<br />
- Roost<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- FeatherDance<br />
- Hidden Power [Dark]</p>
 
<p>Before I get any further. Vader is the best!</p>
 
<p>BrokenKrow. Seriously, this set has 2 counters, Komatana and Hyper Cutter Gligar. FeatherDance on anything that runs physical attacks, Calm Mind on anything that doesn't and Roost when your health drops too low. Sure, Toxic is annoying, but it can be dealt with. Hidden Power Dark is here because Dark Pulse is illegal with Mischievous Heart. With this set, the only things you need to watch out for are the aforementioned and the removal of your Flying typing due to Roost (which I have forgotten several times.) This set is singlehandedly the reason Murkrow deserves a test IMO. It is literally unstoppable if you know what you're doing.</p>
 
<p>In summary, with the advent of Generation V, the Little Cup metagame has shifted enormously and many new playstyles and sets have become far more effective. I hope that this RMT encourages creativity with sets, because that is what we need for the Little Cup metagame to develop further. I know this is probably a little bit long, but thanks for reading! :)</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Crux's team comes from the second round of suspect testing in Gen 5 Little Cup. This was a period which saw an abundance of sun teams, high power offensive Pokemon like Meditite and Scraggy, and strong defensive Pokemon like Slowpoke. Crux's team is of the balanced style, with a slight leaning towards offense; it employs a variety of unique sets to cover a majority of the metagame, and is a good example of what Little Cup has to offer right now.</p>

<h2>Lead</h2>

<p>Crux leads with Frillish, the most defensive Pokemon on his team. Frillish wins most of the 1 vs 1 lead match ups but since it is the most defensive member, losing it that early can lead to troubles down the road. Frillish also stops the common lead Meditite that could otherwise become a pest to kill.</p>

<h2>Core</h2>

<p>The main core of this team is made up of Lickitung, Tentacool, and Murkrow. Tentacool sets up Toxic Spikes to slowly drain health from opposing Pokemon while Lickitung or Murkrow are setting up. Lickitung can sponge the Electric- and Ice-type attacks that are aimed at Murkrow; though after a few Calm Minds, Murkrow doesn't have to worry about anything besides Gligar.</p>

<h2>Sweepers</h2>

<p>Scraggy is a common sweeper on nearly every LC team. Frillish complements Scraggy perfectly; it can negate any Fighting-type attacks aim at Scraggy while Scraggy can take any Grass- or Ghost-type attacks aimed at Frillish. Scraggy doesn't have much room to set up here, however. Murkrow is another deadly force that you should watch out for on this team. Its only counter is Hyper Cutter Gligar, which is in turn checked by other Pokemon on the team like Diglett and Frillish. Diglett and Murkrow have great chemistry together; Diglett can trap any Electric-types that cause Murkrow grief and eliminate them with Earthquake, while Murkrow can switch in on Grass-type attacks aimed at Diglett.</p>

<h2>Threats</h2>

<p>Life Orb Magnemite can cause big headaches for this team. It can easily get a Substitute up against Murkrow or Tentacool, and then proceed to destroy the rest of the team. The only check for it is Diglett, which doesn't want to take a Hidden Power Grass or Ice. Pawniard is another big threat. A set of Swords Dance / Iron Head / Sucker Punch / Night Slash literally can't be stopped once Pawniard sets up a Swords Dance. Gligar can be a problem too if certain Pokemon are KOed. If Diglett is gone, then Gligar can sweep with a Swords Dance under its belt. If Lickitung and Frillish are heavily damaged, then Rock Polish Gligar can sweep through the team.</p>
 
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Crux has a very well thought out and creative team here. It showcases one of the most dangerous threats in Little Cup: Calm Mind Murkrow. The team is a mixture of standard Pokemon, like Scraggy and Frillish, as well underestimated Pokemon, like Lickitung, Tentacool, and Diglett. Those of you who have faced these threats may find it unsurprising that Murkrow and Scraggy have in fact been nominated for suspect testing. All in all, Crux's team is superb, a fine specimen that demonstrates the best of Gen 5 Little Cup.</p>
