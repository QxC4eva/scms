[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prevents moves that lower stats from working for five turns. Remains in effect even if the user switches out.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Mist has little competitive use. As moves that lower stats are quite rare, there is little benefit to protecting your team from them. Furthermore, the moves that do occasionally lower stats have a low chance to even hit, which won't impact one's play. Another thing to consider is the moveslot required&mdash;most Pokemon have better things to do.</p>
