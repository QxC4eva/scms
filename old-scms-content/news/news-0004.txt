VGC 2014 Worlds in D.C.
August 5, 2014
<p>The official VGC World Championship of Pokemon is coming to Washington, DC shortly. The event will be held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, 801 Mt. Vernon Place. This is an amazing opportunity to meet Smogoners from around the world, so if you're in the Eastern US and have some free time, definitely swing by. The competition will be from August 15th-17th.</p>
<p>Post in the <a href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/worlds-in-dc.3513619/">Worlds thread</a> if you'll be there. There should be a good mix of veterans and fresh faces, so head out if you can. ^.^ ~Jellicent</p>
