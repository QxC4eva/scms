Overview
########

-has 2 mega forms, but will mostly be mega-y
-super strong, especially in y form where it actually checks waters pretty hard (take that blastoise)
-good team player with drought or setup sweeper with dragon dance
-probably the best fire type in the meta atm

-crippling weakness to rock, often surprise ohkoed by random stuff with rock slide
-has trouble with ttar, especially if it comes in when zard is charging its solarbeam
-char-y has problems with everything that changes the weather since it's rather dependent on sun
-overall p solid and plays a lot like last year's dragon types (and actually hits harder than them !)

Moves
========

-heat wave for power/strength/etc, etc
-solarbeam to power through waters/rotom/ttar if you have the weather advantage

-ancient power for other zards and talonflames
-protect

Set Details
========

-solar power>blaze for the mirror match where solarpower zard is slightly stronger than megazard at the cost of bulk. doesn't really matter 99% of the time doe
-timid to speed tie, modest to grab ohkos like on that 252 hp mega kang
-EVs ensure rotom's unboosted tbolt doesnt ohko in mega form

Usage Tips
========

-don't always mega evolve first turn; if you're protecting first turn against fake out for instance, don't mega evolve that turn. also try not to fall for rotom-w+ttar solarbeam bait

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Dragon Dance
move 4: Protect
ability: Blaze
item: Charizardite X
evs: 92 HP / 174 Atk / 244 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

-dclaw for stab
-flare blitz for stab
-dragon dance for boost
-protect

Set Details
========

-great because it's immune to wow so the only way to control its boosts is to use intimidate
-evs live CB talonflame (as megazard) and unboosted hydreigon dmeteor (as regular zard), outspeeds common scarfers (rotom-a and bulkier scarfchomps) after a boost and ohkos chomper before a boost, allowing you to ohko it while it tries to rock slide you, provided you dont flinch of course
-adamant b/c you're gonna boost anyway

Usage Tips
========

-bluff being a charizard y
-don't mega evolve while protecting
-try to take advantage of the type change; be willing to take a rock slide or thunderbolt
-you're not REQUIRED to boost since dclaw ohkos dragons and flare blitz is super strong, so try going without a boost if you can get away with it to keep the element of surprise.

Team Options
========

-mienshao (be careful about wide guard baiting dclaw when you mega evolve)
-amoonguss
-scrafty (all of these are for support)

-rotom-w (for ground types, mostly mamo)

Checks & Counters
########

(Y)
-tyranitar
-garchomp
-rotom-h
-salamence (stone edge/rock slide)
-so basically everything with a rock move (non-STAB and specialtar can't ohko with rock slide if intimidated however)
-politoed/rotom-w outside of sun
-mega manectric (?) and zapdos
-manual rain dance (kingdra/prankster users such as sableye/murkrow/meowstic) if you can spare the slot
-goodra/chandelure wall it pretty hard and can deal with a partner venusaur, but can't usually ohko zard

(X)
-kinda hard to do if you don't know it's charx
-salamence/noivern if they outspeed/can dmeteor it after it mega evolves
-garchomp can threaten a rs and force it to mega evolve and then hit it with dclaw/eq
-kingdra kinda walks all over it because it can't change the rain without sunny day and boost to +2 when kingdra's threatening a dmeteor turn 1
-ttar still threatens it, but can't ohko it with rock slide unless it's stupid and doesn't mega evolve
-intimidate
