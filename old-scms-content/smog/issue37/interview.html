<div id="interview">
    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />OK, so let's start with who are you in real life. What do you like to do in your spare time? Do you have a job/going to school?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />In real life, I'm a college student, majoring in mathematics and possibly computer science because I recently found some programming classes I really enjoy. I also work two jobs, one at an ice cream and coffee shop and the other teaching kids.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Ah, that's interesting. What age group of kids do you teach? What do you like best about it?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />I teach elementary school kids. I've always enjoyed teaching and helping people understand things. The students I have are great and its amazing to see them learn and grow!</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Sounds like you enjoy what you do, and that's always good. So, what do you hope to do when you graduate? What would your ideal career be?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />Well something I've recently started looking at is video game design. Like most users, I've enjoyed playing video games for a long time, and I enjoy thinking about what makes a good game. With my new found interest in programming, I've started attending a new video game design club at my school. The club is still starting so I haven't gotten to do anything yet, but hopefully it'll let me know if this is something I'd like to do for a living.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Is there a video game company in particular you think you'd really want to work for?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />I'm considering trying to work with an independent team at first. I'm not just interested in one part of the game or programming someone else's idea; I'd much rather have a greater creative control over the game and its direction.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />So, let's shift gears a bit. What got you into Smogon?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />I got into Smogon right as I was getting out of Pok&eacute;mon. Fewer and fewer of my friends were playing, so I started to lose interest. That's when one of my friends discovered EVs and the hidden factors that affect stats, and while digging through sites like Bulbapedia, he was linked to Smogon where he found the analyses. Originally, he wasn't going to tell me so he could beat me easily, but thankfully he couldn't keep a secret and showed me the site.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Where did you start on the forums?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />I officially started in Stark Mountain, but I was never a memorable poster. The first time I really got into a Smogon community was the Circus Maximus community, which got me on IRC and more involved with the community in general.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />What kinds of games would you play with the Circus crowd?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />I primarily played Mafia, but only because that’s the primary game played. If something else came along, an experimental game or side game like Be Unpopular or Die, I’d generally play it.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />So, tell me, what or who got you back into Pok&eacute;mon and UU?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />Well, even when I was playing Mafia, I was still playing Pok&eacute;mon. I made the jump from OU to UU when the tier had its 5th generation kick-off. I was originally intending to keep up with OU, but I kept creating the same teams over and over, so I lost interest and moved to UU for the rest of the 5th generation.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />What did you like best about UU? And what led to making you a mod there?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />It was a very balanced tier with a good number of Pok&eacute;mon from 4th generation OU, which was something I was used to. There was a range of effective playstyles, and the power level wasn't as crazy as OU. My path to becoming a moderator started with the UU Hub. I'd submitted some written works for it, and kokoloko told me he liked my work, so I started to do more. I started doing analyses, more maintenance for the Hub, and forum projects, which lead to pretty much all my initial badges, and eventually moderator status!</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />I see. That's an interesting turn of events. So, about your dealings with media, what got you into the Smogon YouTube channel?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />It was a wild ride, that's for sure. User LonelyNess had a live Google hangout session where he'd just ladder and anyone could join in and commentate. Some other users and I wanted to do similar stuff, so we made a channel just for UU. It started growing with casts and videos, and at some point, chaos heard about it and asked us why we splintered off from the main channel. We said we really didn't know how to deal with the main channel, so chaos gave me manager access, and then I had my way in.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />What kinds of videos have you done for the main channel and what do you like about making videos?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />Earlier in the year, I had a cohost named keeferz who I did most of my main channel work with. We covered a range of topics, including team building, different tiers, battles, and I honestly haven't done anything nearly as great since he disappeared. I really just enjoy the intersection of media production and competitive Pok&eacute;mon. Before my involvement in the channel, I loved listening to Smogcasts. I learned a lot from them and the other media that Smogon produces (such as this publication!), and helping to make that media is a great feeling.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Do you have any future plans or a direction you want to take for the YouTube channel coming up?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />I'd like to see us gain more long-term contributors. Its easy to find users interested in one Smogcast or one video, but the regularity and brand recognition that comes with constant contributors is something we've lacked for a little while.</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Thanks to your work with the YouTube page and good standing in the community, you were promoted to Senior Staff. What has that been like? Is coming to Smogon different for you now than before?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />In some ways it's different, and in some ways it's the same. It's still a community of people I work with and enjoy playing a game with, but I have much more responsibility. Also, there's some name recognition that comes with that, especially with social media. Sometimes when I mention my username at events, the response is "Oh, I think I've heard of you."</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />OK, last thing to talk about: what has it been like working with the Mentorship program? Do you think it's in a good place? Where do you see it in the future?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />The Mentorship program is unique among Smogon's programs because its scope is the whole website. You can't contribute just to Mentorship, you have to be a contributor elsewhere who lends experience of other site programs. Because of that, our Mentors and leaders tend to be some of the most involved individuals on the site. This means we've got some great, invested users, but also some of the busiest users. I think the program is in a good place, and I hope I see it grow in scope and reach even more new users in the future!</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Alright and last question before we go: What's your favorite Pok&eacute;mon?</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />I've always loved Blaziken since beating Ruby for the first time with it. You know it's the best starter because it's the first one we banned!</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ogl"><img src="/smog/issue36/interview-oglemi.png" alt="" />Alright, thank you so much for your time!</div>

    <div class="interview-speaker ace"><img src="interview-ace.png" alt="" />Absolutely, thanks for having me.</div>
