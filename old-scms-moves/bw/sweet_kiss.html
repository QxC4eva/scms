Confuses the target.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Confuses the target. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Confusion's unreliability as a pseudo-status effect is enough to avoid this attack. Factor in the fact that most of the move's recipients would rather be attacking their foes head-on and you'll see that there's very little reason to use this move.</p>
