<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The best possible Pokemon for an in-game team are the ones that are obtained at the start of the game, can OHKO enemies easily, take little damage from nearly any enemy, can learn many HMs, can heal themselves, can learn useful moves upon level up, don't need excessive TMs, and have a useful ability. Such a Pokemon doesn't exist, of course, but this means that Pokemon closer to this ideal are obviously the best ones to use.</p>

<p>The goal of this in-game tier list is to recommend a select group of Pokemon for an efficient run through the game. The ones that fit most of the above requirements are placed in the high tier. Very inefficient Pokemon will be put in the low tier. Things that are neither efficient nor inefficient, for example Pokemon that have some opportunity costs but don't end up as good as high tiered ones, will be put in the middle tier.</p>

<p>Don't confuse an efficient run with a speed run. Speed runs are often ones that are segmented and recorded with luck manipulation through resets, and aim for the absolute fastest time recorded, but the real time spent on them is usually much more. Just assume you want to play through in a relatively fast time frame. The most efficient team size for these runs is only one member, but if one doesn't assume something more like 3 members, the resulting in-game tier lists become incredibly centralized around Pokemon you get early on in the game rather than anything encountered later on. Also note when reading through this guide that some of the moves and abilities listed for a Pokemon may only be obtained by their evolutions. Some Pokemon may be placed in higher tiers due to their evolutions capabilities as well.</p>

<h2><a name="high">High Tier</a></h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/63.png" alt="Abra" /><br />
<strong>Abra</strong><br />
Availability: Early<br />
Stats: Above average<br />
Movepool: Average<br />
Additional Comments: Psychic typing is very useful for all the Poison-types that are in the game. High Special Attack and Speed stats net quick and easy KOs. However, needs to be traded to fully evolve, which requires two Gameboy Advances/SPs and a link cable or wireless adapter.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/144.png" alt="Articuno" /><br />
<strong>Articuno</strong><br />
Availability: Late<br />
Stats: Above average<br />
Movepool: Shallow<br />
Additional Comments: Has very well-rounded stats and an especially high Special Defense stat. Obtained late in the game but at a high level of 50 which makes up for it.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/1.png" alt="Bulbasaur" /><br />
<strong>Bulbasaur</strong><br />
Availability: Beginning<br />
Stats: Above average<br />
Movepool: Shallow<br />
Additional Comments: Learns 3 useful status moves and has a useful Grass-typing in the beginning of the game. However, there are many Poison-types in the game, which both of Bulbasaur's STABs are not very effective against.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/4.png" alt="Charmander" /><br />
<strong>Charmander</strong><br />
Availability: Beginning<br />
Stats: Above average<br />
Movepool: Wide<br />
Additional Comments: Learns useful moves through level up and TM, such as Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Mega Punch, Fly, and Dragon Claw. Learns a vast amount of HMs as well. Has high Special Attack and Speed stats.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/35.png" alt="Clefairy" /><br />
<strong>Clefairy</strong><br />
Availability: Early<br />
Stats: Above average<br />
Movepool: Very wide<br />
Additional Comments: Learns a vast amount of TMs and useful moves upon level up, and is very bulky both physically and specially. Can also be evolved as soon as it is obtained with a Moon Stone.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/104.png" alt="Cubone" /><br />
<strong>Cubone</strong><br />
Availability: Mid-game<br />
Stats: Average<br />
Movepool: Shallow<br />
Additional Comments: Useful Ground typing for OHKOing the vast amount of Poison-type Pokemon in the game, and has an incredibly high Attack stat once equipped with the Thick Club item, allowing it to OHKO many other Pokemon as well.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/50.png" alt="Diglett" /><br />
<strong>Diglett</strong><br />
Availability: Early<br />
Stats: Average<br />
Movepool: Shallow<br />
Additional Comments: Useful Ground typing for OHKOing the vast amount of Poison-type Pokemon in the game. Instead of catching Diglett you can also capture his evolution Dugtrio who is available in the same area and time as Diglett and is at a significantly higher level.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/rs/106.png" alt="Hitmonlee" /><br />

Stats: Above average<br />
Movepool: Wide<br />
Additional Comments: Very high Special Attack and Speed stats, learns Lovely Kiss upon level up, and her Psychic typing is very useful for OHKOing the vast amount of Poison-types in the game. Unfortunately, you need to trade a man in Cerulean City a Poliwhirl to receive her, but since she is obtained via trading she gains double experience points, quickly making up for the extra effort.</p>
