<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello everyone! This has been the team that I've used throughout most of this round, entirely under the alt qht (hence the name of the thread). The team has peaked at #1 a few times without much effort put into laddering, maxing out at 1410 or something. I decided to retire the team because with Krookodile jumping up to UU (dammit), the team no longer functions. Without further ado, here is the team~</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<img src="/download/sprites/bw/207.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Gligar</strong> @ Eviolite<br />
Ability: Hyper Cutter<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 Spe<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Stealth Rock<br />
- Roost<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Toxic</p>

<p>Although teams no longer have leads in Gen 5, I've decided to list Gligar first because he is the probably the pokemon I lead with most frequently. He lays Stealth Rock, and generally switches out to an advantageous matchup to keep him healthy for checking stuff later. Examples of the crazy amount of bulk Gligar has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adamant CB Entei Flare Blitz: 142-168 (42.51 - 50.29%)</li>
<li>Adamant CB Aggron Head Smash: 170-202 (50.89 - 60.47%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Aggron can easily be stalled out by roost spamming and entei will almost never 2hko without rocks down; of course Gligar isn't my first switch into entei anyways, but it's nice to have a backup check.</p>

<p>The moveset is pretty simple. Stealth Rock is for team support, Roost allows it to wall stuff, Earthquake is an amazing stab move, and Toxic is a great move in general but more specifically allows me to wear down Claydol who is kind of a dick to this team's strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Qwilfish</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 228 HP / 136 Def / 144 Spe<br />
Impish Nature<br />
- Taunt<br />
- Waterfall<br />
- Spikes<br />
- Toxic Spikes</p>

<p>Qwilfish provides the Spikes and Toxic Spikes support that it did for most other teams during this round. It's just so so good at what it does. It sets up spikes on pretty much everything, is a great pivot into physical attackers before I've scouted their sets, picks up my opponent's tspikes, and can block annoying set up mons thanks to a relatively quick taunt; just an amazing team player. Qwilfish generally switches in a few times per game and is incredibly efficient at throwing up hazards. I chose Waterfall over Poison Jab for better all around coverage. My EV spread has a lot of speed to creep defensive Uxie by a few points, and also win speed ties with most opposing Qwilfish. 136 defense hits a bonus point, and the leftover EVs go in HP for general tanking purposes. If you've played any amount of RU this round you know what Qwilfish can do, and it does it well.</p>

<p><strong>Krookodile</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br />
Ability: Moxie<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br />
Jolly Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Pursuit<br />
- Stone Edge</p>

<p>Krookodile is the perfect rotom killer, a problem pokemon for the rest of my team, while being an invaluable revenge killer and even late game sweeper with moxie. Base 92 speed means it can outrun a lot of boosters... basically what you'd expect a scarfer to do. The moveset is standard. Crunch and EQ are for stabs, Stone Edge hits Honchkrow and Moltres among others, and Pursuit is for the aforementioned Rotom. There isn't too much to say about it other than RU will lose a very important pokemon when it moves up to UU.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Will-o-Wisp</p>

<p>Sub wisp rotom, while not my invention (the set was used a bit in gen 4 uu at least, and sub wisp 2 attacks ghosts aren't exactly uncommon) hadn't been used at all in RU until this team hit the scene, and it's one of the most common sets now. </p>

<p>Rotom serves as my spin blocker primarily, and provides a valuable ground Rotom gets tons of chances to set up substitutes thanks to its amazing typing, and then can abuse its powerful stab moves to hurt the opposing team. Substitute and Will-O-Wisp allows rotom to counter SubRoost Honchkrow, thanks to Will-O-Wisp bypassing Sucker Punch's priority.</p>

<p><strong>Gallade</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Steadfast<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 132 SpD / 124 Spe<br />
Careful Nature<br />
- Drain Punch<br />
- Bulk Up<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Ice Punch</p>

<p>Gallade is the closest thing I have to a special tank. The team at this point was really weak to special threats and Gallade can check stuff like Porygon-Z and friends once or twice. It also has an offensive presence which is pretty much a requirement for a team like this.</p>

<p>I use Max HP for general tanking abilities. 124 Speed is enough to creep min speed uxie by 2 so I can set up a sub instead of getting paralyzed. The rest goes in Special Defense to help my subs withstand hits and support the team. I chose Ice Punch over Shadow Sneak mainly for Gligar I guess, but both are usable.</p>

<p><strong>Uxie</strong> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 196 HP / 60 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Calm Mind<br />
- Substitute<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Thunderbolt</p>

<p>SubCM Uxie is the star of the show. Fast enough to outrun a lot of offensive pokemon and kill them, and bulky enough to set up subs stall can't 2hko, Uxie is a very solid sweeper. Its base 95 speed outruns standards like Entei and Rotom, the 130 defenses along with near max HP provide amazing bulk for a sweeper. The 60 Special Attack are because Uxie is pretty weak, as far as I know it doesn't give any relevant damage calcs, it's just for general power.</p>

<p>Calm mind allows it to boost and sweep, Substitute blocks status, and Psychic gives STAB. I decided to go with Tbolt over Energy Ball, as with Spikes support opposing Krookodule aren't as big a threat, and with Subsitute I can use Uxie as a Honchkrow check.</p>
