The notorious drizzle frog returns for another year of VGC. Unfortunately, the poor guy lost its permanent rain from Black and White, and is far from the dominant amphibian it was last generation. However, in VGC where the games are so short, Politoed is still a very viable Pokemon with or without Damp Rock. In addition, although Politoed is frail it takes a strong super effective hit to take the critter down. Politoed has access to some great support moves such as Encore and Helping Hand, although it lost Icy Wind in this years format. Politoed is capable of running a few different sets such as Choice Scarf or support, but most importantly it still has its precious Drizzle to help out possible partners such as Kabutops and Ludicolo. Finally, Politoed's rain obviously ends Mega Charizard-Y's Sun and Tyranitar's Sand. In summary, while Politied has been nerfed since VGC 2013, it is still a viable Pokemon with some neat roles, and its effectiveness should not be undermined.

item: Damp Rock / Sitrus Berry
evs: 252 Hp / 252 Def / 4 SpA

Moves

The most used move on this set is Scald. Scald is preferred over Hydro Pump for the reliability, and the chance to burn dangerous physical threats. Ice Beam is the only other offensive move on this set. Water STAB and Ice STAB is only resisted by some other Water-types such as Rotom-W and Blastoise. Protect is a stable on this set, but remember that it wastes a turn of rain. The positive side of course is to help Politoed against enemy attacks. Finally, in the last spot Politoed can run any number of support moves. Perish Song works great to win against an enemies last two pokemon, while Helping Hand can boost a Pokemon on your parties attack.

Usage Tips

Politoed is most effective as a lead. This Politoed is slower than Tyranitar so you will get your rain up. However, against Sun teams it is reccommended to put Politoed in the back to cancel out Mega Charizard-Y's Drought after the mega evolution. The best plan with Politoed is to lead with it then safely get in your offensive threats as soon as possible to take full effect of the rain. Politoed has a limited offensive move pool so do not expect to kill something like Salamence with Ice Beam because it is incredibly obvious.

Team Options

It is effective to pair Politoed with Swift Swim users such as Ludicolo and Kingdra to have an edge on your opponent in speed. Furthermore, pairing Politoed with any pokemon that benefits from rain such as Thunder Mega Manectric or Zapdos and its frog friend Toxicroak is a great idea to utilize those pokemon to their full effect. Ironically, Fire-types are good partners such as Moltres because they help deal with Mega Charizard-Y. Furthermore, Moltres can spam Hurricane and remove Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur for Swift Swimmers like Ludicolo so they can spam Water-type STAB. Surprisingly, ground-types like Garchomp can prove to be good partners to remove Water immune Pokemon such as Heliolisk and Toxicroak. Ferrothorn is another great partner for Politoed, because Ferrothorn's Fire-type weakness is mitigated by rain. In addition, Ferrothorn can whack Rotom-W with Power Whip, which completely walls Politoed. Amoonguss is another Pokemon that walls Rotom-W, and can put it to sleep, as well as support Swift Swim Pokemon with Rage Powder. Mawile is a cool option because it destroys Tyranitar, however, it sometimes has problems dealing with sun teams. Surf is always an option if you pair Politoed with Pokemon like Gastrodon, Heliolisk, and Toxicroak that appreciate being hit by Water moves. Most importantly, remember not to make a team completely dependent on rain, Drizzle is cool, but it will be very hard to consistently beat other Weather teams relying on Rain.

Other Options

Politoed has a few other options with possible moves and items. Politoed can run a Wacan or Rindo Berry to protect it against super effective attacks and give it a longer lifespan. Choice Specs are also an option to get some real power out of Politoed, while not making it completely useless. Politoed can run Hidden Power Grass to hit Rotom-W off guard or Toxic to stall out some threats such as Mega Kangaskhan. Last but not least, an offensive set with Mystic Water is usable because it still adds power to Hydro Pump without locking Politoed into a specific move. Alternatively, Rest with a Chesto Berry is an option on the support set over Sitrus Berry, and a support move.

Checks & Counters

**Mega Charizard-Y**: A smart Mega Charizard-Y will wait to mega evolve until Politoed comes in. Then it will
immediately cancel out Drizzle.

**Grass-types**: Mega Venusaur It just puts everything to sleep and spams Giga Drain. Amoonguss is the same to a lesser extent because it does not have Thick Fat. In addition, it can just Sludge Bomb Grass-types that cannot be put to sleep.

**Water Appreciative Pokemon**: Politoed cannot scratch pokemon like Toxicroak and Heliolisk. They just absorb its Water-type attacks and set up.

**Water-types**: Rotom-W is the important one. It really does work to rain teams, and is usually the singular check against them on teams without Mega Charizard-Y or Tyranitar.

**Water-type Attack Accuracy**: Hydro Pump and Muddy Water have shaky accuracy, and can make it hard to make a deep run in tournaments. 

**Tyranitar**: Smart Tyranitars can put up sand and seriously hamper Swift Swim Spam.

**Talonflame**: Band Talonflame just destroys pokemon like Ludicolo and Kingdra who make great partners to the little frog, and it almost OHKOs Politoed itself.

**Goodra**: Although it is rare it is pretty much designed to wall rain teams. It laughs at special hits, and without Kabutops, rain teams lack the physical power they had last year.
