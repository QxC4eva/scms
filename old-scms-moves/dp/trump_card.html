[SHORT DESC]
Power increases as PP decreases.

[LONG DESC]
<p>If Trump Card's PP after use is:</p>

<ul>
<li>4+, it has 40 Base Power</li>
<li>3, it has 50 Base Power</li>
<li>2, it has 60 Base Power</li>
<li>1, it has 80 Base Power</li>
<li>0, it has 200 Base Power</li>
</ul>

<p>If Trump Card is selected by another move (for instance, Sleep Talk), it uses the remaining PP of the move that chooses it, rather than the remaining PP of Trump Card, to determine the power.</p>

<p>Trump Card ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers.</p>
