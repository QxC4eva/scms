If the holder becomes infatuated, so does the enemy.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the user becomes infatuated, the effect will transfer over to the enemy, making them both infatuated.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>To be quite honest, nobody uses Attract, and if they do, it's your responsibility as an honourable Pokemon Master to show them the true way to battle. Not kindness and love, but remorselessly bludgeoning your opponents with elemental attacks of various natures.</p>

<p>Also you can't really control luck, so this item's utility is rather limited, and zero if they don't use Attract at all. But mostly the above.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Opelucid City - Talk to girl inside building between Pokemon Gym and Battle House</p>
