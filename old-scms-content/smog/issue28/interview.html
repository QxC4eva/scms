<div id="interview">

<div class="aside"><p>Late at night, I heard the gentle buzz of my phone on vibrate. Glancing at the caller ID, I cringed to see the name Mysterious Voice. Picking it up, the voice immediately said, "I have another mission for you. Your task will become more clear when you get to Wisconsin."</p>

<p>"What the hell is in Wisconsin?" I sighed, knowing it was useless to resist. "Whatever, I guess just send the limo again."</p>

<p>"Yeah, the limo ride last time sort of stretched our budget. You'll be taking a more... classic form of transportation this time..." Looking outside, I spotted an old Conestoga wagon that looked like it hadn't been touched in 200 years. The half dozen oxen attached to the front looked even older. This couldn't be serious, right?</p>

<p>Three weeks later, we were deep in the heart of Wisconsin when the oxen stopped to drink from a lake. Stepping off to stretch my legs, I heard the sound of dance pop growing louder and louder in my ears. A flamboyantly decorated raft with a full bar on board was making its way towards the shore. As it drew near, the man steering it reached out a hand. Suddenly realizing why I was sent here, I grabbed his hand, hopped aboard, and poured myself a fruity drink before beginning the interview.</p></div>

<p>So, Oglemi, can you tell me a bit about yourself in real life?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>Well, I'm a 21-year-old white male gay college student who lives in the smack dab middle of Wisconsin.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>Sounds exciting enough. Is there anything to do in Wisconsin other than play Pok&eacute;mon?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>Not particularly lol, especially out in the country where I am surrounded by cornfields. I go to college in Madison though, so there's plenty to do during the school year. The summer is the best in Wisconsin though, I love just being outside, laying out on the lake on my raft. This year I'll be able to drink and sunbathe at the same time :o</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>Then you'll be a 21-year-old tan male gay college student :)</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>That's the plan anyway 9.9 and skinny too (suck it joshe). I'm down 20 pounds from last year and I mark that as one of my better accomplishments, apart from you know getting into UW-Madison.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside"><p>I raised my glass to cheers him on his good work before we both downed our drinks. That girly booze went down so smoothly!</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>Haha, nice. So, what is it that you do on Smogon?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>A lot.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>So true...</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>The main thing I do is contribute to C&amp;C. I've been contributing consistently for nearly the past 3 years.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>What was it that first got you into C&amp;C?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>Rising_Dusk used to post the "Recently in C&amp;C" bits on the front page, and would provide the links to the small changes thread. I remember reading Heysup's Abra analysis, and finding a ton of mistakes, so I made an account to post in the small changes thread. I didn't come back for a while though. I posted my first analysis a couple years ago over the summer cuz I felt some of the analyses for DPP UU were horrible and outdated. So I posted my Solrock analysis and it sat without a single post for over a month. Eventually I posted other analyses and FlareBlitz and whistle began actually QCing them. My first analysis uploaded was Huntail, and that was such a cool feeling.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside"><p>Oglemi beamed brighter than a Solrock as he thought back to that first accomplishment.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>From there I started picking up old and abandoned analyses and started shoving them onsite. Eventually whistle and Eo felt they weren't up to the task anymore and whistle nominated me for C&amp;C mods. I've been at the helm of various areas of C&amp;C since&mdash;uploading, GPing, QCing, you name it.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>You're definitely the king of small changes. Did you realize 1 in every 10 edits to the site were made by you? What's kept you going all this time?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>I hadn't realized it until I was doing something on the SCMS about a year ago and discovered you could look at the number of edits people have made. It was then I realized I had almost caught up to the #1 editor at the time (Great Sage) and made it a goal to surpass him. Well that has come and gone and I've just continued chugging along. As to what keeps me going, I don't really know. I guess it's a combination of intense boredom otherwise and a desire to see the site be at a certain standard.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside"><p>Glancing around the countryside surrounding the lake, intense boredom suddenly made a whole lot of sense...</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>Ever since I acquired the ability to edit the site directly I've made it a kind of my goal to get the whole site at a standard where I can be happy with its grammar and standardization, and content too I guess. It's just really cool to see something you've put a lot of effort into put up on the "big screen" so to speak, for a world of thousands of Pok&eacute;mon nerds to see. I remember seeing Smogon's analyses years ago and thinking it was really cool that somebody had taken the time to try and analyze every Pok&eacute;mon, and now I'm a big part of that.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>Is there anything you'd like to change about the C&amp;C process?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>Now? No, myself, Great Sage, ibo, phil, R_D, C_M and all the other C&amp;C mods have spent years working towards a process that works, and in my opinion, we've accomplished that. Sure the process can always be tweaked, but it's astounding how much better the process is now than when I first contributed 3 years ago, and it was already waaaay better then than where it was a year previously.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>You're also responsible for leading the best tier (RU). What's that experience been like?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>Exhausting to be completely honest; don't let anybody tell you leading a tier is easy. When I took the helm of the newly created RU tier I knew it was going to be a big job and tumultuous, which is why I immediately enlisted a second in command in Nails. It's been tough trying to make the right decisions as to how to: decide when a vote is appropriate, who to allow on a council, how to keep the forum active, how to keep drama at bay, how to connect with the other leaders of the site, and how to deal with just the shit, for the lack of a better word, for some of the stuff that goes on.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>How did you end up at the helm, anyway?</p>
</div>

<div class="aside"><p>He leaned back against the bar, polishing off his drink before responding.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>Good question.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>I try.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>I vouched right away when the talk for the creation of the tier began that I would lead the tier, and when it was made I stepped forward and made a thread in InsideScoop saying I wanted a subforum for the new tier that R_D had made with the usage stats and that was playable on PO, and I said there that I would lead the tiering decisions for RU. I guess the senior staff at the time was ok with it because I was recognized as such. There were definitely voices against its creation, but Arti (I believe) went through with it in the end and gave me the forum, added the tier to the Dex, and well here we are.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>Is that a voucher you would make again?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>We'll see, I don't know if I'll be leading a tier in the next generation because I'll be busier than ever next semester with school. There's already been times this generation where I've been too negligent with the tier because of outside forces. As for the creation of a new tier, it'd take some serious convincing for this next generation, but for the one after that we'll probably see the addition of yet another tier just because of the vastness of the number of Pok&eacute;mon we're going to have at that point lol.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>As a tiering leader, you mentioned part of your job was to decide when a Pok&eacute;mon deserved to be suspected. What qualities do you feel contribute to a Pok&eacute;mon being worthy of banning?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>"Only when broken"; the definition of which is a bit loose, but I've always felt it was when you can put the Pok&eacute;mon on a team and have an immediate serious advantage against your opponent just for having it, even if your opponent is prepared for it or whatever, though they should be. The best example of which I can think was Venomoth in RU in Round 0. It was so easy to click Sleep Powder, QD, BP, destroy, or if you wanted to be tricky just sweep with it. Yanmega was a very close second lol.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside"><p>Thinking back to the days of Venomoth and Yanmega, we both shuddered a little.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>Are there any underrated RU Pok&eacute;mons you'd like to give a quick shout-out to?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>The great thing about RU is that it is so extremely diverse, which is why I think it's the best tier to play; I don't know if I would have stuck around to lead the tier if it wasn't fun to play too. This makes it hard to pick out any in particular, but if I have to pick one, it'd definitely have to be Rhydon. The thing is so good and has been a part of a good number of my teams since Rhyperior left us for UU.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>Outside of C&amp;C and RU, you've also been a big contributor to The Smog. What got you started there?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>I remember it being the release of Issue 15 I believe, and they were backed up on grammar, so macle told me to get Smog access so I could GP some stuff. I helped them shove through some grammar and have contributed various things since. I've written over 15 articles for The Smog to date I believe, and have contributed GP to nearly every release since I started.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>What are your top 10 best Smog articles?</p>
</div>

<div class="aside"><p>I stared at him seriously for a moment before adding with a laugh that I was just kidding.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>lol, but yeah the Smog article I'm most proud of is definitely my Top 10 Most Fabulous Pok&eacute;mon, since I got to poke fun at gay people and Game Freak's designs (my gay comrades 9.9). I definitely wasn't expecting the feedback I got from it, but I don't regret anything.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>That article was fabulous. So, from one interviewer to another, what side of the table do you prefer being on?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>I like this side, I had fun on your side and I was glad to help out but I think I'm glad to be done contributing in that aspect for now, not to say I'll never be on your side ever again 9.9</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>You've turned against me ;-;</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>Never ;-;</p>
</div>

<div class="aside"><p>I straightened up a bit and looked him dead in the eyes.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>Alright, so, all that other shit was pointless, cuz this is the real question: what's your favorite Pok&eacute;mon?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>This is tough because I'll shift from one day to another between three Pok&eacute;mon. Today it'd have to be Simisear because I'm feeling pretty fabulous. Gardevoir is such a cool Pok&eacute;mon and it's a good Pok&eacute;mon to have Fatecrashers draw it cosplaying stuff (GardSue 4 lyfe). And lastly Onix has always been one of my favorites ever since I saw it in the anime, it was so cool when Brock broke him out (and no I don't think I like it because of some Freudian phallic lust). I just like it cuz it's a freaking giant rock snake that will smash your sorry ass. Too bad in the games he hits as hard as a Pidgey ;-; Oh well.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>There's always Steelix~</p>
</div>

<div class="aside"><p>The sun was starting to set, and the dance music was only getting better with each drink. I knew it was time to wrap things up.</p></div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>So, are there any closing comments you'd like to leave our readers with?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker oglemi">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_oglemi.png" alt="Oglemi" />
<p>Just love thy neighbor and love thy world.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-speaker jelli">
<img src="/smog/issue28/interview_jellicent.png" alt="Jellicent" />
<p>It was a pleasure to interview you, Oggy. Thanks for your time. Now let's get off this raft and dance~</p>
</div>

<div class="aside"><p>We partied ashore for a few more hours before parting ways. As I climbed back onto the Conestoga wagon, I looked back to watch my friend drift off into the night on his strange little raft. Settling into the wagon, I stretched out on the old wood floors, electropop and appletinis still buzzing through my head.</p></div>
