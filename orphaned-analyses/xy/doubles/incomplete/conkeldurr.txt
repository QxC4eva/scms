Overview
########
very strong, works well both in and out of trick room thanks to average speed
good bulk on both sides, further boosted by assault vest
stays alive for a while thanks to solid bulk and recovery from its main stab, drain punch
stab mach punch is good for killing off low health mons
two good abilities: iron fist boosts the power of a lot of conks moves, and guts is great for doing well against pokemon that like to use status such as rotom-w and trevenant
good choice of coverage moves to choose from
above 2 points make it a versatile mon


Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Drain Punch
move 2: Mach Punch
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Ice Punch
ability: Iron Fist / Guts
item: Assault Vest
evs: 108 HP / 152 Atk / 104 Def / 144 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
drain punch is main stab, recovers hp which is very useful, but often doesnt do enough damage thanks to relatively low power
mach punch is useful for revenge killing low health pokemon
knock off provides solid coverage against ghost types and psychic types, is rly strong and gets rid of the opponents item which is awesome
ice punch is also very good coverage against stuff like bulky grounds and flying types
Set Details
========
assault vest boosts special defense to high levels, so conk can take special hits all day while recovering health with drain punch
the evs allow conk to live LO latios psyshock and 2 timid zardy heat waves in sun while keeping as many evs as possible left over for attack
adamant for maximum powa
if using in trick room, use 0 speed ivs and brave nature
iron fist boosts the power of all its attacks except knock off which is useful
guts turns burns and stuff against your opp
Usage Tips
========
works well both in and out of trick room, but the trick room support is still useful
drain punch does a shit ton of damage especially w/ iron fist boost
conk can easily take hits and do loads of damage back vs stuff like ludicolo
use mach punch to finish off low health mons even in tr, cos they might have priority (dont do this if they have a possible quick guard user tho)
if the opp can be killed by any move except mach punch, check their team. if they have no fighting resist alive use drain punch. if they do, use knock off.
Team Options
========
trick room users (cresselia, chandelure, jellicent, dusclops etc.). they also appreciate conkeldurr removing dark types like ttar and bisharp which otherwise are annoying
cress in particular can provide useful helping hand support, set up reflect to soften physical attacks, psyshock deals with a lot of conks checks
intimidate mons (salamence, gyarados, lando-t, mawile)
steel types can take psychic and flying moves aimed at conk. follow me jirachi in particular is good at this, as it can redirect them completely and absorb the hit with ease. heatran is another good one as it compeltely beats talonflame, a big pain for conk

Trick Room Attacker
########
name: Trick Room Attacker
move 1: Hammer Arm / Drain Punch
move 2: Mach Punch
move 3: Ice Punch / Knock Off

ability: Iron Fist / Guts
item: Life Orb
evs: 96 HP / 252 Atk / 80 Def / 80 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Brave

Moves
========
hammer arm is your strongest stab, boosted by iron fist. it also lowers your speed so you can outslow even more stuff in trick room
drain punch is another strong fighting stab move that can be used over hammer arm if you dont need as much power, but want some sort of recovery
mach punch is useful for revenge killing low health pokemon, and gives conkeldurr a better chance outside of trick room
protect can shield you from attacks for a turn so your partner can take out an annoying opponent, scout for moves and stall field conditions
ice punch is good coverage against stuff like bulky grounds and flying types
knock off gives good coverage vs ghost and psychic types, and is easily spammable thanks to removing the foes item
Set Details
========
life orb boosts your power so you can hit as hard as possible
the evs let you survive a max attack metagross zen headbutt after taking life orb damage, with the rest thrown into spD
adamant for maximum powa
iron fist boosts the power of all its attacks except knock off which is useful
guts turns burns and stuff against your opp
poison jab is an option over ice punch to hit fairies
Usage Tips
========
works well in trick room, so that support is appreciated
drain punch does a shit ton of damage especially w/ iron fist boost
you can easily spam hammer arm as long as trick room is up, as it does loads of damage and lowers your speed so you can outslow even more stuff in tr
conk can easily take hits and do loads of damage back vs stuff like ludicolo
use mach punch to finish off low health mons even in tr, cos they might have priority (dont do this if they have a possible quick guard user tho)
if the opp can be killed by any move except mach punch, check their team. if they have no fighting resist alive use drain punch. if they do, use knock off.
Team Options
========
the same as the other set lol
trick room users (cresselia, chandelure, jellicent, dusclops etc.). they also appreciate conkeldurr removing dark types like ttar and bisharp which otherwise are annoying
cress in particular can provide useful helping hand support, set up reflect to soften physical attacks, psyshock deals with a lot of conks checks
intimidate mons (mawile is good cos works in tr too). not as useful for this set as it is more offensive and not bulky, but still nice to have
steel types can take psychic and flying moves aimed at conk. follow me jirachi in particular is good at this, as it can redirect them completely and absorb the hit with ease


Other Options
########
rock slide and eq as good spread moves, also provide good coverage
stone edge is a more powerful alternative to rock slide, and it gets around wide guard cos no spread
poison jab is an option to hit some fairies like sylveon and gardevoir, but only works on the switch unless trick room is up
flame/toxic orb along with guts boosts attack up to high levels and also gives u a status absorber, but dies much faster thx to residual damage
thunder punch provide additional coverage against stuff like gyarados, but not much else
choice band fucking destroys. ice punch ohkos lando-t at -1 atk
focus punch with follow me support is rly powerful, especially with iron fist + band

Checks & Counters
########
fairies take shit from anything except poison jab (togekiss is still hurt by ice punch, mawile+klefki by drain punch)
outside of trick room, psychic, flying and fairies can outspeed and do a lot of damage
burn on non guts conk is really useful for wearing it down and reducing the damage it does, but you should be sure its iron fist before you do that
mega pokemon take shit from knock off, so if they resist fighting they can do quite well vs conk (mega venu, mega garde, mega pinsir)
TALONFLAME THE DESTRUCTINATOR
togekiss and amoonguss manipulate what move conkeldurr goes for by basically forcing it to use ice punch, which works to conks disadvantage
basically any intimidate mon is annoying, but scrafty has to watch out for drain punch, lando-t has to be scared of ice punch and hitmontop is still hit for a decent amount of damage at -1
while not a direct counter to conkeldurr, preventing trick room from going up reduces conkeldurrs effectiveness
