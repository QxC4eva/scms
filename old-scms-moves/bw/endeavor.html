<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Reduces the target's current HP to that of the user. Does not affect Ghost-types. Fails if the target's current HP is less than or equal to the user's current HP. This is counted as a damage-dealing attack, and hence cannot be blocked by Taunt.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Endeavor is an interesting move, bordering gimmick and competitive. It is an unreliable way to deal damage, because in order for it to work effectively one must be at low HP. Since such a situation is generally unfavorable, many strategies around Endeavor have evolved. The most common is F.E.A.R., where a level 1 Pokemon is equipped with a Focus Sash. As the opponent attacks, the F.E.A.R. Pokemon uses Endeavor to bring the opponent down to 1 HP. The user then follows up with a priority move, dealing exactly one damage and KOing the opponent. However, this strategy is seriously weak to hazards, among other things. Other ways to use Endeavor are with Magic Guard Pokemon, which are not affected by hazards.</p>
