The target cannot switch out.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prevents the target from switching out. The target can still switch out if it is holding Shed Shell or uses Baton Pass, U-turn, or Volt Switch. If the target leaves the field using Baton Pass, the replacement will remain trapped. The effect ends if the user leaves the field or if the user or target faints. Note that if the user then uses Baton Pass, the effect will now end. Pokemon protected by Magic Coat or the ability Magic Bounce are unaffected and instead redirect this move back to the user. Does not prevent the effect of Eject Button. If the target is hit with Roar or Whirlwind while Mean Look is in effect, they will be forced out as per normal.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Mean Look can be used to trap and eliminate a troublesome Pokemon on the opponent's team, which is quite a useful tool to have. However, the effects of the move can no longer be Baton Passed, which makes the move less useful than it has been in the past. Furthermore, most Pokemon with access to this move cannot eliminate its opponent. Murkrow is a notable exception, as it has priority on Mean Look and Perish Song, and can stall out an opponent with Roost or Substitute.</p>
