[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Causes the holder's Bind, Clamp, Fire Spin, Magma Storm, Whirlpool, and Wrap to always last 6 turns.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Grip Claw doesn't see much practical use in any given tier due to its situational effect. This item is particularly specialized for temporary trapping moves (i.e. Magma Storm and Whirlpool), which usually lack consistent reliability and power. On top of this, when you consider the 2-5 turn counter the moves already offer, Grip Claw doesn't contribute significantly to the user's health or offensive power, two factors which are arguably more valuable than a few extra turns of trapping. If you are considering using a temporary trapping move, keep in mind that there are better items to use in conjunction with it.</p>
