Moves
=======
- Leech seed gives you both recovery and passive damage, allowing Ferroseed to heal itself while maintaining your momentum.
- Bullet seed is the STAB of choice as it allows Ferroseed to beat sturdy users such as Tirtouga. 
- Ferroseed is very good at setting either Spikes or Stealth rock due  to its fabulous typing and bulk giving it an ample amount of free turns
- Thunder Wave is a great move for crippling many pokemon who would use Ferroseed as a free switch in, such as Murkrow and Mienfoo
- Protect allows Ferroseed to scout opponent moves, play mind games, and works in conjunction with Leech Seed for recovery.

Set Details
=======
- The given EVs are set to maximize overall bulk. 22 hp / 18 def / 18 spd bulk is massive when paired with an Eviolite.
- Eviolite is the preffered item of choice because of Ferroseed's semi-reliable recovery in Leech Seed
- Eviolite allows Ferroseed to absorb more hits overall, while also allowing it to take some super effective attacks.

Usage Tips
=======
- Ferroseed should come in on the many Water and Grass-typed pokemon in the metagame and use them to set up hazards.
- Ferroseed should abuse Leech Seed as much as possible to keep it  healthy, while using Thunder Wave to cripple any obvious switch ins such  as Mienfoo if it is capable of doing it.
- Ferroseed is capable of slowly grinding out threats such as  Misdreavus if it lacks a set up move, abusing Leech seed recovery and  Bullet Seed. 

Team Options
=======
- Spritzee is loved by ferroseed as they are good at covering each  others weaknesses, while also helping keep each other alive with wish /  leech seed
- Pokemon who enjoy Thunder Wave support such as Houndour and Honedge are good teammates
- Things to soak Fire hits such as Chinchou, Houndour, or Ponyta as a lot will be aimed at Ferroseed.
- Fighting resists such as Misdreavus and Trubbish are great partners for Ferroseed.
- Set up Sweepers such as Scraggy can easily take advantage of  Ferroseed, making revenge killers such as Fletchling and Choiced Scarf  pokemon valuable teammates.
- Defog is a real problem as it removes Ferroseed's hazards, making Pawniard an ideal teammate for soaking up the Defogs.

Other Options
#######
- Iron Head is a reliable Steel-typed STAB for Ferroseed to reliably  check Fairy types, but Bullet Seed is generally more useful to deal with Tirtouga
- Seed Bomb is a consistent Grass-typed STAB, but the existance of Sturdy users makes Bullet Seed the more desireable option
- Toxic is more passive option for Ferroseed to deal damage, allowing  Ferroseed to focus on chipping away the opponents health with protect  and Leech Seed.

Checks and Counters
#######

**Fighting-types** : Meditite, Mienfoo, Scraggy, Timburr all can come in  with little fear and threaten Ferroseed with their Fighting-typed STAB.

**Fire-Types**: Houndour, Ponyta, and Larvesta work in the same way  Fighting-types do, having relatively free switch ins while being able to  threaten Ferroseed.

**Grass-types**: While Grass-types do not actually threaten Ferroseed,  Ferroseed also fails to threaten them. Depending on the set, These free  turns could be a struggle for both players.

**Defog and Rapid Spin**: Pokemon such as Drilbur and Vullaby do not  actually beat Ferroseed, but removes the hazards Ferroseed struggled to  put up.

**Pawniard**: Pawniard fears nothing Ferroseed has, and can easily use  Ferroseed as set up bait. It does not even fear Thunder Wave that much  due to Sucker Punch

**Misdreavus**: Misdreavus's massive bulk allows it to set up on Ferroseed almost for free, only fearing Thunder Wave
