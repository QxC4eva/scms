<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hey Smogon! I'm back with another RMT, and this time it's for the newly formed Smogon Doubles tier. Recently, Zarel added a Smogon Doubles ladder to Pokemon Showdown, and I decided to post a team I've been having success with to commemorate that, as well as to hopefully help bring attention to a fun and amazing tier, show that Sand is viable even in a metagame with weather threats like DrizzleSwim and Blaziken, and give players new to the tier an idea of what it's like (or a team to try it with if they so choose) while also featuring pokemon that I like and think and think should receive more usage. In terms of accomplishments, this team also took first place in a mini-tournament hosted by Articblast on PS! (too lazy to ladder with it, so it doesn't have any ladder peaks, but it is definitely capable of doing well on the ladder as) as well as doing well against higher-level Doubles players. I've decided to post this team so I could focus on trying other playstyles, as well as to give people an idea of what a solid Sand team looks like (and because I like making RMTs). The teambuilding of this team was fairly formulaic, with me simply choosing to go with the Singles Sand formula of 1 Sand Setter, 1 Sweeper, and 2 Water Resists and basing my choices around that. Anyways, onto the team:</p>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<img src="/download/sprites/bw/248.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong> @ Chople Berry<br />
Ability: Sand Stream<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD<br />
Brave Nature<br />
- Rock Slide<br />
- Crunch<br />
- Low Kick<br />
- Protect</p>
<p>Tyranitar was the first pokemon I went with for this team, since I obviously needed a Sand inducer to make a Sand team. Plenty of people have also been testing Hippowdon, but I think Tyranitar does multiple things that make it superior. It KOes Psychics and Ghost-types with it's powerful Crunch, which helps the team combat opposing Trick Room teams, since most common TR setters are Psychic and Ghost. One Psychic in particular it can help get rid of is Cresselia, which could potentially get in the way of Excadrill if left to do what it wants, as well as making life for the team hard through the use of support moves like Light Screen, Reflect, etc. Another thing it has going for it is higher attack than Hippowdon, letting it dish out more damage with its attacks. The EV spread is pretty basic, basically being designed for it to be as bulky and powerful as possible. Also, it can actually take advantage of the sand it sets with the 50% SDef boost it gets under Sandstorm. A Brave nature and 0 speed IVs help it get the jump on opposing weather starters if you lead with it, causing sandstorm to be put up. Chople Berry helps cover it's Fighting weakness, letting it check Psychics and Ghosts more effectively (as they usually have Focus Blast) and live through some weaker STAB Fighting attacks. Crunch and Rock Slide are the obligatory STAB moves, with Rock Slide giving useful spread coverage and a nifty flinch chance, Low Kick is to hit Steels that resist the first two moves, and Protect lets me scout moves, prevent Tyranitar from taking damage for a turn, and stalling out things like Trick Room and Tailwind.</p>

<p><strong>Excadrill</strong> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Sand Rush<br />
EVs: 60 HP / 252 Atk / 196 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Rock Slide<br />
- X-Scissor<br />
- Protect</p>
<p>Excadrill. The king, a generally badass looking pokemon, and this team's lategame sweeper. This was the second pokemon I chose for the team, and I have yet to regret it. Not only is Excadrill very powerful with it's 135 base Attack, it also gets its Speed doubled in Sand, which was why I chose to use it over other Sand sweepers such as Landorus and Terrakion. A LO boosted Earthquake is nothing to joke about, and can put lots of hurt on an opponent's team, as well as being a spread move. Although it hits every pokemon on the field, which include its ally, 3/6 pokemon on the team have Levitate anyways, so it rarely becomes a huge problem. Between Earthquake and its two other moves, not much can stand up to Excadrill's might, and the few things that can are eliminated by Excadrill's teammates. By the time the rest of the team is done with your opponent, they should be too weakened to stop an Excadrill in Sand. Rock Slide gives Excadrill EdgeQuake coverage and a way to hit things that are unaffected by Earthquake. X-Scissors hits things such as Cresselia and Latios that could otherwise halt an Excadrill sweep, thus its inclusion on the set. The EVs let it outspeed up to Scarf Terrakion in the Sand, with the rest being put into bulk and attack, and a Life Orb is used to ensure the maximum amount of power on for its attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Cresselia</strong> @ Chesto Berry<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 40 SpA / 216 SpD<br />
Calm Nature<br />
- Psyshock<br />
- Icy Wind<br />
- Rest<br />
- Helping Hand</p>
<p>Cresselia is easily one of the best pokemon in the tier right now. It's as good as it is beautiful (which is to say very very good). Outside of just being very bulky, it has a great ability in Levitate and a slew of great support moves, such as Helping Hand and Dual Screens. It checks many threats that could otherwise be tricky to handle, such as Fighting types, as well as just being a good mixed wall in general. Seriously though, if you're looking for a support mon, Cresselia should be one of your first choices. Levitate also helps it be a good check to opposing Sand sweepers as well as avoiding my Excadrill's Earthquake. Psyshock gives it a STAB attack and makes sure it can do something if it's Taunted, Icy Wind helps against faster teams by lowering the Speed of opposing mons so my pokemon can land a hit first, as well as hitting Dragon, Flying and Grass Types for good damage at the same time. Rest helps form the age-old ChestoRest combo, which cures Cresselia of status and brings it back to full health so it can keep doing its job, and since games are usually shorter in Doubles, getting off one Rest is usually all that's needed for Cresselia to continue doing its job of supporting the team. Helping Hand helps give its partner a 50% attack boost, which can be useful to get a KO you might otherwise not. The EVs allow it to be bulkier on the special side, with 28 SpAtk EVs being to ensure a 2HKO on 252 HP Hitmontop and Hariyama (why that's not standard is beyond me, because those are pretty important if something is to act as a Fighting check)</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-W</strong> @ Sitrus Berry<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD<br />
Modest Nature<br />
- Hydro Pump<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Thunder Wave<br />
- Protect</p>
<p>The little washing machine that could. This was originally added as a Rain check as well as providing a Water attack, and has become an incredibly valuable member of the team. Since it resists Water and Flying attacks while being able to hit back with powerful STAB Thunderbolts and crippling Swift Swimmers with Thunder Wave, it can easily threaten standard Rain teams. It also helps against Sun and Sand teams, as Levitate helps it dodge Earthquakes from sand and Hydro Pump hits common members of Sun and Sand teams for super effective damage. Outside of being an obligatory STAB move, Hydro Pump provides a water attack for this team, which is a great offensive type. I originally had Discharge > Thunderbolt, but it limited my offensive options too much so I switched to Thunderbolt and haven't regretted it. It serves as a secondary STAB and provides nice coverage, as well as being a more accurate option if I don't wanna gamble on Hydro Pump. Thunder Wave cripples a fast sweeper and stops them from outspeeding my team in their respective weather, as well as helping with the fact that this team has plenty of members with middling speed, and Protect is Protect (if you want a better explanation it's the same as for T-Tar). Sitrus Berry is very useful, as in Doubles games aren't lasting that long, so the 25% boost is always very useful to rejuvenate Rotom-W and allow it to keep threatening the opposing team.</p>

<p><strong>Hitmontop</strong> @ Fighting Gem<br />
Ability: Intimidate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe<br />
Adamant Nature<br />
- Fake Out<br />
- Close Combat<br />
- Feint<br />
- Wide Guard</p>
<p>Hitmontop is another amazing support mon. There's never a game where this doesn't put in work for me, whether it's through Fake Out, or wasting an opponent's attack through Wide Guard, this thing is consistently amazing. It's something to be considered on many teams, and it's little wonder it's so common in VGC, because it performs well in Doubles as well. Fake Out seems to be a waste of a slot to the inexperienced, but in reality it's one of the best moves in the tier. It lets you halt an opponent's move for the whole turn, which in the fast-paced world of Doubles can be enough to KO something. Fake Out can incapacitate a threatening pokemon and then let your opponent finish it off so it can't pose problems later, as well as forcing Protects and dealing that last bit of damage. Close Combat is the STAB move of choice, and does good damage to neutral targets, as well as threatening out things that are weak to it. Feint is used to play around Protects and potentially surprise unaware opponents and get a surprise kill. Wide Guard is really useful on this team. It prevents Hitmontop and its teammate from taking damage from spread moves for the duration of that turn. Basically, your opponent can use something like Heat Wave or Rock Slide and nothing will happen to your Pokemon. Better yet, if they use Surf or Earthquake, only their mon will take damage. It helps protect things like Tyranitar from common spread moves that could otherwise deal large amounts of damage to it. Intimidate is also a useful ability to help cushion the blows of and potentially neuter the many powerful physical threats in the tier, and also helps mons like Cresselia survive for even longer than they otherwise would. 252 HP is to make it as bulky as possible and 252 Atk lets it hit as hard as possible. Fighting Gem replaced Leftovers since although the recovery every turn was useful, Fighting Gem lets a boosted Close Combat OHKO/Do significant damage to many things it hits neutrally, making Hitmontop a nuke for one turn, which can be very useful (An example is that it severely weakens Rotom-W, a major counter to Excadrill)</p>

<p><strong>Latias</strong> @ Draco Plate<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br />
Timid Nature<br />
- Dragon Pulse<br />
- Psyshock<br />
- Tailwind<br />
- Protect</p>
<p>Latias was the toughest member to put imo. I had two other mons before it, but neither did what I needed then to do. Latias was put here because the team needed a secondary Rain check, and it hasn't let me down yet. This thing isn't getting nearly enough use imo. It's just too great at what it does.Latias > Latios by a lot. It was chosen over Latios due to the fact that it has better bulk, which would allow it to stay in the battle for longer and better check the dangerous weather threats that it needs to. It also acts as a secondary check to Fighting-types and helps eliminate opposing Dragons. Thanks to the useful resists to Fire and Grass given by its Dragon typing, Latias can also effectively check Sun team as well, not taking much damage from the STAB moves of common Sun sweepers while being able to deal a lot of damage in return. Levitate lets it come in on opposing Earthquakes and be unaffected by those fired off by my own Excadrill. Dragon Pulse is used as its main STAB move. Psyshock is a secondary STAB and also served to let it muscle past mons with a higher Special Defense than Defense. Tailwind replaced HP Fire after DTC's suggestion since after a lot of time to test it, although life against Scizor did get harder, Tailwind significantly eased my matchup against opposing weather teams, helped keep speedy sweepers in check, and even netted me some surprise KOs if my opponent forgot Tailwind was active so I could outspeed and KO an important mon, making Tailwind a superior choice all in all. I used Tailwind when using this team in various tournamets and it has yet to disappoint.I needed an item to let it have increased offensive presence without having the one time effect of a gem or the recoil from a Life Orb + Sandstorm, so Draco Plate ended up being the best choice for my needs.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I've enjoyed using this team, and it's helped expand my knowledge of the tier. I hope that this RMT helps get others to try what is a fun and enjoyable tier (there's a ladder now, so you have no reason not to). Any feedback on the team would be appreciated, so feel free to rate, hate, luvdisc, etc. Also, a shoutout to everyone on #doubles for making the tier that much more of a joy to play, for making it alot easier to test this team and get better at the tier, and for just being generally amazing people.</p>
