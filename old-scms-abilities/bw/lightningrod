<h2>Description</h2>

<p>All Electric-type attacks, even those from the wielder's ally in multi battles, hit the wielder with 100% accuracy regardless of the intended target, and give a Special Attack boost of one stage instead of doing damage. If the wielder and a Pokemon using <a href="/bw/moves/follow_me">Follow Me</a> are out at the same time, and a Pokemon uses an Electric-type attack targeted at the Follow Me user's team, Follow Me will take precedence. If <a href="/bw/moves/hidden_power">Hidden Power</a> is Electric-type, it will be redirected and absorbed as well. If the wielder is already immune to Electric-type attacks (such as <a href="/bw/pokemon/marowak">Marowak</a>), the natural immunity takes precedence, and the wielder does not receive any Special Attack boost. If a Pokemon with <a href="/bw/abilities/mold_breaker">Mold Breaker</a> uses an Electric-type attack, it will be redirected but not absorbed by Lightningrod. If two Pokemon have Lightningrod in a multi battle, the faster Pokemon will draw the attack. In the event of a speed tie, the Pokemon who has been on the field longest will draw the attack.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There aren't really any decent users of this ability. <a href="/bw/pokemon/manectric">Manectric</a> and <a href="/bw/pokemon/raichu">Raichu</a> are the standout ones but neither are very good and won't be seen very much outside of the lower tiers. <a href="/bw/pokemon/zapdos">Zapdos</a> has this ability but it is unreleased as of right now, but once it is expect to see Lightningrod a lot more often.</p>
