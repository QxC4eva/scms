[Overview]

<p>While Ditto spent the last four generations of Pokemon shunned in the corner of Bill's PC Box, only brought out to breed with other Pokemon, Dream World granted it a new lease on life. With Imposter, Ditto copies any stat boosts, moves, abilities, and even the species of the opposing Pokemon itself! Ditto works as a fantastic revenge killer thanks to its ability to both annihilate threats with the immense Speed granted by a Choice Scarf and take advantage of the opponent's boosts. This also makes the opponent wary of setting up early in a match, as the opponent does not want to get demolished by his own sweeper. However, Ditto is not without flaws. Its checks and counters completely depend upon what it changes into, limiting Ditto's staying power. Our little pink blob should never be underestimated, though, as one wrong move can spell impending doom.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>This is Ditto's best, and only, set in the Dream World metagame. With Imposter, Ditto automatically transforms into the opponent upon being sent into battle. Ditto has a bit of a four-moveslot syndrome, so choosing the correct move is imperative... Well, not really. If anything, Ditto has a one-moveslot syndrome. In fact, the only reason Ditto has a move is because without it, one would not be able to use Ditto. Still, Transform adds nothing to Ditto's utility, as Imposter accomplishes what Ditto would already do with Transform, though Transform does not copy stat boosts and wastes a turn.</p>

<p>Ditto should only be sent out against Pokemon that one wants to revenge kill, as that is Ditto's most effective role. This holds especially true against setup sweepers that have already acquired multiple boosts, as it simply makes Ditto more deadly. If Ditto can manage to come out against Technician Breloom, Excadrill lacking Air Balloon, Swords Dance Garchomp, or Calm Mind Latios, it can use the opponent's momentum against them and sweep with impunity. However, as always, one should never send Ditto out against an opponent that has a Substitute up, as Ditto cannot transform into a Pokemon behind a Substitute and will simply become dead weight.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>Ditto's EVs are nearly useless in all situations except the very rare case where one's opponent sends Ditto out on the same turn that one's own Ditto is sent out. In this case, neither Ditto will transform, and a stall war will ensue. Thus, one wants to have the slower Ditto, as it will use Struggle after the opponent receives recoil damage, giving it an advantage. However, Ditto copies the stats of any other Pokemon that it transforms into, so the EVs serve no further purpose. Ditto does not, however, copy the opponent's IVs, so one should make sure that Ditto's IVs are set for the Hidden Power of choice. Using 30 Attack and 30 Defense IVs gives Ditto Hidden Power Ice, a good move for all-around coverage.</p>

<p>Ditto is a unique Pokemon, so it is only natural that it should be used differently than other Pokemon. Ditto should absolutely never be used as a lead or sent out to sponge a hit; these simply ruin its purpose. Instead, Ditto can be used to take on setup sweepers after they nab a KO, or simply revenge kill opposing threats. This puts Ditto users in a dilemma: what move should be used? As a general rule of thumb, Ditto should use a move that will allow it to stay in and do as much damage as possible. However, should Ditto be presented with an immediate threat that must be taken out, using the appropriate move and switching out will usually suffice.</p>

<p>Ditto is also useful for scouting opponents' movesets, as it copies every move. For example, sending Ditto out against Deoxys-S seems like a bad idea for the most part, but this actually allows you to learn whether or not Deoxys-S is an offensive variant or not. Similarly, one can scout setup sweepers in order to react appropriately and wall them, or to scout versatile Pokemon to learn how to stop them.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>With a one move movepool, it is hard to imagine that Ditto has very many other options! In all seriousness, the only change to the set above that can be made regards the IVs. Ditto can manipulate its IVs to gain the Hidden Power of its choice, so running a set with 30 Attack and 30 Defense IVs can provide Hidden Power Ice, running a set with 30 Attack, 30 Special Attack, and 30 Speed can provide Hidden Power Fire, and so on. Remember to not fully take away from Ditto's Speed IVs, as one does not want Ditto to be as slow as dirt.</p>

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>While most of Ditto's checks and counters are entirely subjective to the Pokemon Ditto transforms into, there are Pokemon that can stump our little pink friend. Users of the move Substitute can set up a Substitute and prevent Ditto from transforming into them, rendering it useless. Additionally, there are Pokemon that Ditto will not appreciate transforming into. While Choice Scarf Blissey may seem like a game-changer, one should note that locking Ditto into Softboiled and attempting to stall out special attackers is really not as entertaining as it seems.</p>

<p>In any case, Ditto has to live in fear of walls that can wall what it transforms into. For example, should Ditto transform into Breloom, Xatu or Dragonite make for wonderful switch-ins. Additionally, should Ditto transform into Chandelure, Tyranitar, Snorlax, and other specially oriented tanks can make short work of it.</p>
