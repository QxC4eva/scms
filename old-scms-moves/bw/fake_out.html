[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 100% chance to flinch the target. Pokemon with the ability Inner Focus or Shield Dust will not be flinched. This move fails if it is not the first move used by the user when it is sent out. It does not cause the opponent to flinch if it does not hit the opponent or does not affect it. This move has a priority of +3.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Fake Out has a bit of utility in singles metagames for a bit of quick and simple—albeit very predictable—damage. The move's poster children include Mienshao and Ambipom, both of which are well known for sets revolving around using Fake Out and switching out with U-turn before the foe can break their fragile bones.</p>

<p>In the VGC environment, Fake Out is one of the best moves around. The ability to completely shut down one of your foe's Pokemon while your partner attacks is absolutely fantastic. Whether you use it for buying some time to take down a key threat, or just as a way of doing some easy damage alongside a spread attack, Fake Out is a move one must always prepare for when building your team. Hitmontop is VGC's classic rags-to-riches story, and Fake Out is a big reason for its success. Technician can beef up the pitiful 40 Base Power of Fake Out, while Fake Out and Intimidate combine to make Hitmontop an awesome all-out team support Pokemon. If you ever find it difficult to set up Trick Room, Hariyama is a great option to help set it up, all thanks to Fake Out. Not only does Fake Out allow your Trick Room setter to worry about one less Pokemon, it also gives Hariyama the turn it needs to activate its status Orb.</p>
