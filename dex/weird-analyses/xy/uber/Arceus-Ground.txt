Overview
########

Ground Arceus gained new niches during the generation shift. Ground types suddenly found themselves as a premier typing in the metagame. This gives Ground Arceus a powerful role on all team archetypes. With excellent bulk, attack, and support options, Ground Arceus can be fit into many teams. The most important role for Ground Arceus is to absorb Bolt Strikes from Zekrom. Ground Arceus also can be a powerful sweeper that shoots off +2 STAB Earthquakes from 120 base Speed.

However, it suffers from the presence of Water- and Grass-types. Pokemon such as Scarf Kyogre outspeeds and OHKOs Ground Arceus with ease. One must ensure that Ground Arceus is supported with water and grass resists. However, on a Sticky Web team you can simply outspeed and OHKO Water-types.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Recover / Extreme Speed
item: Earth Plate
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

Moves
========
Earthquake is an incredibly powerful move. With Swords Dance boost, Earthquake OHKOs virtually all non-Levitating pokemon in the metagame except support Arceus. Stone Edge nails the levitating pokemon, such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Lugia for super effective damage. Recover can be used for longevity and increasing its defensive capability. However, Extreme Speed is useful to finish off scarved pokemon that attempts to revenge kill you. Ice Beam should be only used on a sticky web team to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Shaymin-S super effectively.

Set Details
========
Maximum Speed and Attack allows Ground Arceus to outpace and hits with maximum power for most of metagame. Since Ground Arceus has an excellent typing and bulk, HP investment is unnecessary for setting it up. However, if Ground Arceus is used on a sticky web team, an alternative spread with Adamant nature, 44 HP, 252 Attack, and 212 Speed can be used. 212 Speed allows it to outspeed base 100, notably Charizard Y which is immune to sticky web and hits hard with Fire Blast. The adamant spread is stronger, however sticky web is crucial for its success.

Usage Tips
========
Sword Dances Ground Arceus functions the best as a late game sweeper, when the speedy threats are removed. Burn is threatening for Ground Arceus, so be mindful about setting up on potential pokemon that can learn Will-o-Wisp. The speedy water and grass types will quickly switch in to prevent you from setting up, so be sure to deal with them accordingly. Despite of its weakness, it has an excellent immunity of electric. So, Ground Arceus can liberally switch into Zekrom's Bolt Strike or Volt Switch, and grab the momentum.

Team Options
========
It is mandatory to have good Scarf Kyogre checks on a team with Ground Arceus. Since, Scarf Kyogre can easily revenge kill Arceus Ground with Surf. Scarf Zekrom, Palkia, and specially defensive Dialga are excellent for this role. Yveltal and Xerneas are also, excellent teammates for removing Giratina-O and pressuring support Arceus. Gothitelle, Wobbuffet, and Mega Gengar are all good trappers that can aid Ground Arceus with removing key threats such as support Arceus and creating conditions where Ground Arceus can freely set up. A burn absorber or Aromatherapy support is recommend to ensure that Ground Arceus is free from burn. Blissey and defensive Xerneas excel at this supporting role, and Blissey helps with support Arceus weakness that Arceus Ground has. Generally, Xerneas and Ground Arceus probably will be paired together, because they create a dual immunity against Zekrom. Specs Kyogre is a nice offensive partner, since it lures in and wear down many of Ground Arceus's checks, such as Giratina. In return, Ground Arceus absorbs the Bolt Strikes for Kyogre.

Other Options
########
Calm Mind set with Judgment, Ice Beam, Recover, and Calm Mind can be used, however it's vastly inferior to Swords Dance set in this generation. There is no serious reason to ever run this set, unless you're Furai. A support set of Earthquake, Stone Edge, Recover, and Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, Defog, or Stealth Rock can be used to surprise the checks and support the team. This set is also, one of the best Zekrom check in the metagame. Specially defensive support set can run roar to phaze Geomancy Xerneas. Dragon Claw can be used over Recover or Extreme Speed on Sword Dance set to pick off Giratina-O. Magic Coat can be used to troll Deoxys lead and status aimed toward it. Gravity can be used to remove the ground immunity and bypasses some of its checks.
