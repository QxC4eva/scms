[Overview]

<p>A pretty good Pokemon, but easily walled by Golem and Rhydon. The only way you would really be able to take those bad boys down is if you Mimic an Earthquake from a really low HP switch-in from the mentioned Pokemon, and take them down. It's a good late-game sweeper if you're sick of Persian and Tauros, but unfortunately, unlike them, it has no way of dealing with Ground-types, and it's not as fast.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Basically, Dodrio is a poor man's Tauros. It hits hard and fast for some quick pain, and suffers all the problems Zapdos does and more. It's best used as a lead, mainly as a counter for the popular leads which are Jynx and Exeggutor. Dodrio has a 60.85% chance to kill Jynx with Hyper Beam when you include the critical hit rate when it hits, with a 54.54% including the miss ratio. If you don't want it as a lead, then it's great sweeper material after your opponent's Alakazam is paralyzed and at 80% health, their Rhydon is dead, and Snorlax just took an Explosion from your Exeggutor. Bring it out and let the fun begin.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Agility, but you don't have much time to set up before you get walled or killed, so you're better off hurting stuff when you can. It can work once Golem and Rhydon are out of the way though. Substitute is okay, and Leer could scare off an incoming Psychic-type.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Golem and Rhydon top the list of counters due to their Rock typing. Other bulky Ground-types or Pokemon with general high Defense stop it, especially if they have a super effective move or a STAB special move. Paralyzing Dodrio is also a surefire way to counter it.</p>
