User steals the effect of the target's Berry.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Should the target be holding a Berry, the user steals this and immediately consumes it; if applicable, the user will experience the Berry's effect, for instance, recovering itself from status with a Lum Berry. The user will not experience the effects of a Custap Berry or Berry Juice consumed by this move.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Pluck is a rather gimmicky move to use, mainly because of its low Base Power. While the chance of taking and using a Berry the opposing Pokemon may be holding seems like a cool idea, Pluck just isn't strong enough to do anything meaningful and is outclassed by other, stronger physical Flying-type moves such as Brave Bird. In addition, using Pluck purely for the purpose of taking the opponent Pokemon's Berry is very gimmicky, as the opposing Pokemon may not even be holding a Berry at all. Also, the Berry that is stolen from the opposing Pokemon may be detrimental to your own Pokemon, so it's best to abstain from using Pluck.</p>
