Bounces back certain non-damaging moves.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Until the end of the turn, the user is unaffected by certain non-damaging moves directed at it and will instead redirect such moves to the original user. The accuracy check occurs after the move is redirected. This move has a priority of +4. Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes can only be reflected once per side, by the leftmost Pokemon under this or the ability Magic Bounce's effect. If the user has the ability Soundproof, this move's effect happens before a sound-based move can be nullified. The abilities Lightningrod and Storm Drain redirect their respective moves before this move takes effect. For the turn in which Magic Coat is used, the following moves will not affect the user, but rather, will be bounced back at their user:</p>

<ul>
<li>All moves that induce status as their only effect (including Yawn), except Teeter Dance</li>
<li>All moves that do no damage but alter the target's stats (including Flatter and Swagger), except Defog and Memento</li>
<li>Attract</li>
<li>Block</li>
<li>Gastro Acid</li>
<li>Leech Seed</li>
<li>Mean Look</li>
<li>Spider Web</li>
<li>Worry Seed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Magic Coat is useful for surprising opponents that employ non-damaging moves against your team, such as Spore, Stealth Rock, or Whirlwind. However, once the surprise factor is gone, opponents can predict around the move, or use the "free turns" to attack. Furthermore, the prediction itself is hard, since some users opt to attack when they have the slightest hint of Magic Coat.</p>
