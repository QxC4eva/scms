<h2>What is Balanced Hackmons?</h2>

<p>The idea behind <a href="/forums/threads/balanced-hackmons.3489849">Balanced Hackmons</a> is simple; any Pokemon can have any move and any ability. While this might seem overpowering, there are a few rules set in place to create a more balanced metagame. Firstly, some abilities were banned for, well, balancing purposes. Furthermore, all OHKO moves are banned. Because of its nature, Balanced Hackmons is an incredibly diverse tier filled to the brim with creativity.</p>

<h3>Rules:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wonder Guard, Pure Power, Huge Power, Shadow Tag, Arena Trap, and Parental Bond are banned.</li>
<li>All clauses are off besides OHKO clause.</li>
<li>A new clause is in effect that limits the same ability to no more than two Pokemon on your team.</li>
</ul>
