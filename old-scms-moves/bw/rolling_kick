<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 30% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Rolling Kick should never be considered for competitive play because all the Pokemon who can use Rolling Kick have much better options. The Elekid line has access to Cross Chop, the Machop line has access to a 100% accurate DynamicPunch, and Hitmonlee and Hitmontop have access to Close Combat. These are all superior options due to higher Base Power, as well as better accuracy for two out of the three listed moves.</p>
