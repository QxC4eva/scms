Wacky Wi-Fi

[page]

<p>This is a tournament series in which all of the tournaments are created by and voted for by the users, all built to be played on Wi-Fi. Each month, players can submit any idea for a tournament, although the point is to be creative. About halfway through the month, there will be a voting week in which anyone can vote on which of the submitted tournaments they would like to play. After that, signups will be held the next week. This will happen each month, as long as there is enough activity.</p>

<p>Note that illegal hacking, disconnecting, or repeated inactivity are all reasons that one could be banned from these tournaments.<br />
Currently the following users are banned: None.</p>

<p>The current tournament is: <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3459810">[January] Diversity Cup</a>. Submitted by <a href="/forums/member.php?u=10012">Ditto</a>.<br />
