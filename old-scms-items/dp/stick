<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If the holder's current species is Farfetch'd, its critical hit rate is increased two stages.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Stick is a unique hold item for Farfetch'd that raises its chance of scoring a critical hit by two stages. Stick is useful when paired with moves such as Air Cutter, Leaf Blade, Night Slash, and Slash that already have high critical hit rates. However, Farfetch'd has little to no competitive potential, meaning Stick's effect rarely comes into play.
