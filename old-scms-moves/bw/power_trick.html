Switches Attack and Defense stats.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Switches the user's base Attack and Defense stats. The effect is lost if the user switches out or faints. This move can be used again to swap the stats back. If the user uses Baton Pass, the replacement will have its Attack and Defense stats swapped if the effect is active.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Power Trick Shuckle! Yeah! But seriously, this move is almost always outclassed by traditional setup moves like Swords Dance and Bulk Up, which most carriers of Power Trick already have. Power Trick Medicham is a cute idea, but Pure Power is applied when Medicham attacks, instead of directly adding to the Attack stat, so trying to give Medicham super-high Defense wouldn't work.</p>
