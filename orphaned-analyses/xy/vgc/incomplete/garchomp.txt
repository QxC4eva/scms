[Set Recommendations]

Set Name: Standard Attacker
Garchomp @ Life Orb / Yache Berry
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spd
Jolly Nature
- Dragon Claw
- Earthquake
- Rock Slide / Stone Edge / Fire Fang
- Protect / Substitute

Garchomp's Standard Set, provides perfect neutral coverage to the entire metagame
Dragon Claw deals strong single target damage
Earthquake is strong spread damage
Rock Slide for spread damage and a chance to flinch, but deals less single target damage than Dragon Claw
Stone Edge for strong single target damage, almost guaranteed OHKO on Charizard and Talonflame
Fire Fang deals significantly more damage to Scizor and Abomasnow, OKHOing most variants
Protect is Protect, eases prediction and protects Garchomp from most forms of damage. Substitute can be used as additional protection against status.
Life Orb for increased damage, turns some 2HKOs into OHKOs (such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y)
Sand Veil ability takes advantage of the ever-prevalent Tyranitar, boosting evasion while Sand is up.
Yache Berry is an option to sometimes prevent a OHKO from Ice attacks (depending on the attacker), but some Pokemon can OHKO thru it.
Jolly nature and 252 speed EV is needed to speed tie rival Garchomps and to outspeed base 100 speed Pokemon, 252 atk for maximum physical damage.
Choice Scarf set is viable, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame.
Sand Veil + Bright Powder is an option given the prevalence of Tyranitar and lack of evasion clause. Under Sand Garchomp is much more difficult to hit and KO, but this is a risky strategy.
Can run a mixed set, swapping Jolly nature for Naive and including Draco Meteor or Fire Blast as desired.
Garchomp needs no support to perform its job, but Safeguard helps protect against Burn and Sleep status, which end its sweep
Dragon Rush hits harder than Dragon Claw, but accuracy is shaky.
Set Name: Mega Garchomp
Garchomp @ Garchompite
Ability: Sand Veil -> Sand Force
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spd
Jolly / Adamant Nature
- Dragon Claw
- Earthquake
- Rock Slide / Stone Edge
- Protect / Substitute
Plays almost the same to Standard set, but has significantly more powerful Earthquakes and Rock Slides/Stone Edges in Sand
Monstrous 170 base attack after Mega Evolution
Sand Support from Tyranitar or Hippowdon is highly recommended so that Sand Force activates
Inside sand, Mega Garchomp has some of the strongest Earthquakes and Rock Slides / Stone Edges in the entire game. Outside of Sand it approaches Life Orb Garchomp damage without the recoil.
Significant speed drop from base 102 to base 92; Pokemon that it could outspeed before are now serious threats such as Jolly Haxorus, Hydreigon and Salamence
Like standard Garchomp, Mega Garchomp has the stats to run run a mixed set, changing to a -SpDef nature and running Draco Meteor or Fire Blast as desired.
Due to holding Garchompnite, very susceptible to status and ice attacks. Team support with Safeguard or Light Screen is highly desired.
Set Name: Sharknado (Sand Veil abuse)
Garchomp @ Bright Powder
Ability: Sand Veil
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spd
Jolly / Adamant Nature
- Dragon Claw
- Earthquake
- Substitute / Rock Slide
- Protect / Substitute

Set is explicitly designed to make Garchomp a difficult Pokemon to hit, and therefore KO.
Under Sand, Sand Veil and Bright Powder increase evasion to 30%
Dragon Claw provides strong single target damage, while Earthquake provides strong spread damage.
Substitute is recommended to further make it hard for opponent to score a direct hit
Protect is Protect, preventing the opponent from damaging Garchomp
Rock Slide is a spread attack can induce flinches, making it even more difficult for the opponent to score damage.
Sandstorm support is highly recommended. Tyranitar and Hippowdon can both provide 5 turn Sandstorm to trigger Sand Veil thanks to their Sand Stream ability. Also works to turn opposing Tyranitar's Sand Stream against them.
Set Name: Choice Scarf Pivot
Garchomp @ Choice Scarf
Ability: Rough Skin
EVs: 156 HP / 228 Atk / 124 Spe
Adamant Nature
-Dragon Claw
-Earthquake
-Stone Edge/Rock Slide
-Iron Head/Fire Fang/Rock Slide
With this spread, guaranteed to outspeed base 135s (Mega Manectric and slower) and still have enough firepower to OHKO/2HKO several notable threats
Survives unboosted Hidden Power Ice from most threats, as well as unboosted Ice Shard from Mamoswine and Mega Abomasnow
Dragon Claw and Earthquake are standard STABs.
Stone Edge provides very strong single target damage, guaranteed to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and OHKO Talonflame through a Charti Berry (after Brave Bird/Flare Blitz recoil damage)
Rock Slide provides spread damage. Noticeably weaker than Stone Edge, but has a chance to cause both opponents to flinch.
Iron Head provides strong single target damage versus Fairies, and deals more damage versus Rock and Ice Types than Earthquake/Stone Edge
Fire Fang lets Garchomp bite through the defenses of Steel types like Skarmory and Scizor, as well as threaten Abomasnow.
This set acts more like a defensive pivot than a sweeper: Come in on something fast that Garchomp can handle defensively, and outspeed, netting surprise KOs. Though it can handle several threats, it works best once key threats are already weakened.


[Checks and Counters]
Protean Greninja is almost completely guaranteed a OHKO with Ice Beam even through a Yache Berry
Mega Abomasnow will usually OHKO thru a Yache Berry, but it risks a OHKO in return from Stone Edge or Fire Fang.
Other Pokemon with Ice-type attacks threaten a OHKO even thru a Yache Berry, but all must beware a powerful retaliation
Mawile can switch in on Dragon Claw and Intimidate before activating Mega Stone, and OKHO with Play Rough, but it cannot safely switch into Earthquake.
All Fairy types in general threaten with strong Fairy attacks and can freely switch into Dragon Claw
Intimidate users in general will reduce Garchomp's effectiveness, turning some of Garchomp's 2HKOs into 3HKOs
Garchomp is completely powerless under Trick Room, often moving last due to its high base speed.
Burn status from Will-O-Wisp makes Garchomp much more manageable.
Changing the weather away from Sand will nullify Sand Veil and Sand Force bonuses, but Garchomp is still potent even outside favorable weather.
