-Such 4 moveslot syndrome
-Umm transform

Set Details
========

- Choice Scarf is the only item that allows it to effectively check set up sweepers and megas.
- 248 EVs in HP makes Ditto hit a Stealth Rock number, which means Ditto will be hurt slightly less by some forms of residual damage. Maximum investment in Defense decreases damage that Ditto takes from a Struggle war with another Ditto. A Relaxed nature is used to obtain the lowest Speed for the possible, albeit rare, Struggle war with opposing ditto. 0 Speed IVs can be used to fare better in these wars and give you Hidden Power Ice but [can someone check mechanics to see if this is true] it would mean losing out on being able to speed tie versus opposing choice scarf users.

Usage Tips
========

- Revenge kill or bring in with baton pass/volt switch/u-turn
- Can be used to scout movesets
- Against stall use to remove or set entry hazards

Team Options
========

-More of a glue to a team, doesn't pair with any pokemon particularly well.

Other Options
########

-Could run another item but is highly ill-advised
-Different IVs for a different hidden power type

Checks & Counters
########

-No true universal counter
-cannot copy behind a substitute
-m-gengar and other trappers can often revenge kill if ditto hasn't become a ghost type
-Anything that can beats ditto before ditto beats it
