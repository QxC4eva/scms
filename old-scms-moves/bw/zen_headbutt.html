<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage and has a 20% chance to flinch the target.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Zen Headbutt is usually the "Psychic-type STAB of choice" for physically-oriented Psychic-types, facing little competition from Psycho Cut thanks to its higher Base Power and much better distribution. The flinch chance is a nice bonus, but shouldn't be counted on, unless you are running Jirachi.</p>
