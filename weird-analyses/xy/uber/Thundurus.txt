
Overview
########

- Prankster allows it to pester offensive teams with fast thunder wave
- Also allows Thundurus to anti-lead suicide spikes setters like Deoxys-S with Taunt
- Fairly high spatk and access to Taunt allows it to pester more defensive pokemon as well
- Naturally high speed and STAB Volt Switch helps in maintaining momentum while Grass Knot nails the ground types immune to Volt Switch
- Very frail
- Weak to Stealth Rock and reliant on LO so passive damage racks up quickly

Prankster
########
name: Prankster
move 1: Volt Switch / Thunderbolt
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Thunder Wave
move 4: Grass Knot / Hidden Power Ice
ability: Prankster
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

- STAB Volt Switch hits hard and keeps momentum. Thunderbolt can be used if you want to hit harder and not be forced to switch out.
- Taunt stops the enemy from setting up their own hazards, statusing you, or Defogging 
- Thunder Wave cripples offensive threats like Xerneas or Mewtwo and cuts off their sweeps and leave them vulnerable to slower attacks
- Grass Knot nails ground types like Groudon and Ground Arceus but HP Ice OHKOs Landorus-T and Gliscor and does actual damage to Zekrom
- Focus Blast can be used to hit Excadrill and Dialga

Set Details
========

- Max spatk and speed is needed to hit as hard and fast as possible as Thundurus is very fragile
- Timid nature is a must to outspeed slower defensive Arceus formes as well as Palkia

Usage Tips
========

- Bring it in on predicted EQs and scare out the ground type with Grass Knot
- Can often lead thanks to Prankster Twave and Taunt being very threatening early game and cutting off any potential early advantage
- Volt Switch can easily get Thundurus out of a unfavorable matchup
- Overall, thundy can't switch in on much but you can take advantage of it's prankster options to stop your opponent's momentum and start your own

Team Options
========

- Other U-turn users can help keep momentum and get Thundurus in more often
- A ground-type and fairy-type can help keep Zekrom in line as the dragon can switch into Thundurus very easily
- Ground-types also help with KOing Dialga while Fairy-types can switch in on Dialga's Draco Meteors and force it to use one of it's coverage options

Other Options
########

- Toxic can cripple more defensive pokemon like bulkky arceus
- Nasty Plot can boost spatk but thundurus is too slow and fragile to sweep
- Knock Off can pester switch-ins by getting rid of their items
- Superpower hits blissey and it doesn't miss but overall inferior to Focus Blast which is already an unorthodox coverage choice

Checks & Counters
########

**Zekrom**: By far the biggest drawback to using Thundurus. Zekrom comes in extremely easily as it resists Thundurus's attacks and can't be paralyzed. It also applies massive pressure on whatever attempts to switch in thanks to its powerful STABs.

**Dialga**: Resists Thundurus's attacks and can easily KO it with Draco Meteor and setup Stealth Rock to limit Thundurus's switches, doesn't mind being paralyzed much

**Electric Arceus**: Immune to paralysis and resists Volt Switch. Grass Knot can hurt some but overall Thundurus can't really stick around to fight this Arceus forme.

**Excadrill**: Immune to Thundurus's Electric-type STAB and isn't weak to his main coverage options

**Stealth Rock**: Greatly limits the number of times Thundurus can switch in

**Blissey**: Can easily sponge just about any special attack and natural cure means paralysis isn't a problem at all. It doesn't like Taunt much and it's a Pokemon that is very easy to take advantage of so Volt Switch can lead to pretty strong punishes.

**Grass Arceus**: Like Electric Arceus except prone to paralysis and generally mediocre

**Ground / Flying-types**: Gliscor and Landorus are immune to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt while not being weak to Grass Knot, although their low special defense still means they take a decent chunk.

**Kyurem-W**: Dislikes Thunder Wave and having to switch out right from Volt Switch right after taking heavy damage from Stealth Rock but, otherwise, Kyurem-W doesn't fear much from Thundurus and can easily OHKO it with any of its attacks.

**Reshiram**: Very similar to Kyurem-W in that it takes Thundurus's attacks well but has to deal with a crippling Stealth Rock weakness and being paralyzed.

**Mega Charizard X**: Has no difficult in switching in and KOing Thundurus. Although, does not like being paralyzed by Thunder Wave. Charizard's weakness to Stealth Rock is also bothersome as it will often have to switch out right after coming in on Volt Switch. Also needs to be already mega evolved.
