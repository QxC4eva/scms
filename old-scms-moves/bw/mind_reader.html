The next move used will always hit.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Guarantees that the next move used by the user will not miss the target, even if the target has used a move like Fly or Dig. Effect is lost if either the user or the target switch out before the move is used. Does not allow user to hit through Protect or Detect. Works with OHKO moves. Fails if the user tries to use this move again during effect.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Mind Reader has little competitive use since its effects are easily negated by the opponent switching out. Furthermore, the combination of Mind Reader and an attack takes two turns, leaving the user susceptible. The Pokemon would also lose a valuable moveslot, better used for a coverage or set-up move.</p>
