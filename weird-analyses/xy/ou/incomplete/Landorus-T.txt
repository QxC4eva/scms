Overview
########
With a plethora of strong, Physical threats roaming within the XY metagame, Landorus-T establishes itself as a solid answer to many of the most popular Pokemon in the tier. Landorus-T’s massive Base 145 Attack is still amongst the highest in the tier, punching holes in opposing teams with powerful Ground STAB. Its ability, Intimidate, is perhaps its greatest asset, giving Landorus-T the ability to switch into many Physical attackers and softening their assaults. Its typing defensively is also useful, granting it key resistances and immunities, an immunity to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and neutrality against Stealth Rock. Landorus-T also has access to boosting moves such as Rock Polish and Swords Dance, granting it the opportunity to sweep or wallbreak.

Landorus-T’s typing, while one of its strengths, is also one of its key weaknesses. Ground/Flying finds itself susceptible to many common attacks, specifically Ice (4x) and Water, which in turn makes it weak to certain priority moves, like Ice Shard and Aqua Jet. Base 91 Speed, while not slow, is fairly mediocre and results in Landorus-T finding it hard to keep pace with common Pokemon in the tier. Landorus-T’s offensive options are both few and unreliable. Earthquake STAB is fairly predictable and easy to switch into, while its coverage moves either have accuracy issues or are fairly situational.

Offensive Pivot
########
name: Offensive Pivot
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Stone Edge / Knock Off / Hidden Power Ice
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant / Naughty
evs: 248 HP / 16 Atk / 244 Def

Moves
========
Landorus-T has access to Stealth Rock, enabling it to set up a key entry hazard for teams in need of support throughout the entire match. Unlike other users of Stealth Rock, however, Landorus-T has the ability to threaten opponents offensively with its strong STAB and attacking stats. Earthquake is Landorus-T's primary STAB option and hits opposing Pokemon hard, even without investment. U-turn gives Landorus-T the ability to be an effective pivot, scouting potential switch-ins and creating momentum for its teammates. The last move directly correlates to specific checks that need disposing of. Stone Edge enables Landorus-T to be a decent Talonflame and MegaPinsir check, as well as hitting Defog users like Zapdos and Mandibuzz hard and threatening common switch-ins like Charizard and Kyurem-B. Rock Slide is an effecitve alternative to Stone Edge if you want to improve accuracy, but hits noticeably softer than Stone Edge on certain threats. The recently improved Knock Off is an excellent support move, removing items such as Gliscor's Toxic Orb, Skarmory's Leftovers, and Choice Scarf that opposing checks dearly rely on. Knock Off also has the potential to 2HKO checks like Trevenant, Bronzong and Gourgeist-S. Hidden Power Ice may seem like an odd choice given Landorus-T's massive Attack stat, but its deceptively good Base 105 Special Attack enables Hidden Power Ice to hit Gliscor, opposing Landorus(-T), Garchomp and Dragonite hard.

Set Details
========
Acting as an offensive pivot, Landorus-T needs all the bulk it can receive from EV investment while having the capacity to combat certain threats in the metagame offensively. 248 HP EV's produces a Stealth Rock number, ensuring that it takes as least damage as possible when switching into hazards. 16 Attack EV's guarantees a 2HKO on Multiscale Dragonite with Stone Edge, making Landorus-T a far better check to it. The rest of the EV's are placed into Defense to maximize physical bulk in conjunction with Intimidate. An Adamant nature ensures that Landorus-T has enough power to combat opponents while ensuring that its defenses are stable. If one opts for Hidden Power Ice, Naughty is the preferred nature, enabling the coverage move to hit as hard as possible in exchange for a small Special Defense drop-off. Leftovers gives Landorus-T its only form of health recovery, something it lacks outside of Wish support. An interesting alternative to Leftovers is Rocky Helmet, tacking on extra damage to threats like Talonflame and further hindering the Physical attackers of the tier (particularly U-turn users).

Usage Tips
========
As the title suggests, this set gives Landorus-T the ability to be one of the best offensive pivots in the metagame, utilizing its key immunities and resistances in conjunction with Intimidate to switch in on opposing Pokemon and force the opponent to react. This forces the opponent to switch to a Landorus-T check, lest your opponent risks taking big damage or giving Landorus-T an easy opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. As a result of this, Landorus-T creates a domino effect, enabling teammates to switch in right after and eliminate opposing Pokemon that Landorus-T can't handle by itself. U-turn plays a vital role in this, tacking on additional damage while giving teammates a free opportunity to switch in with potentially little consequence. The Offensive Pivot set can be used in all stages of battle effectively, but it finds its greatest use in the early and middle portions of the game, where it can find opportunities to set up Stealth Rock as often as possible and create momentum for its teammates early on in the match. Once Stealth Rock is placed, Landorus-T should focus on utilizing its powerful STAB Earthquake to punch holes in opposing teams or utilizing U-turn to scout switch-ins and provide set up opportunities for teammates. Keep an eye out for Landorus-T checks as the game progresses, utilizing Landorus-T's coverage move of choice when an expected check or counter switches in. Removing checks early could mean all the difference for Landorus-T later on in the match.

Team Options
========
Rotom-W is the perfect partner in crime for the Offensive Pivot set, resisting all of Landorus-T's weaknesses and using Volt Switch to create even more offensive momentum for teams. Rotom-W is also equipped to dispatch most of Landorus-T's checks as well, including opposing Ground/Flying Pokemon and Physical walls like Skarmory and Hippowdon. Similarly, bulky Water Pokemon like Vaporeon and Blastoise can switch in on resisted attacks and provide support for Landorus-T and the rest of the team. Wish users like Vaporeon, Sylveon and Jirachi are very helpful for Landorus-T, granting it a form of recovery as the match progresses. The Offensive Pivot set forces many switches throughout the duration of a match and chips away at opposing Pokemon with U-turn, so hazards support is always a boon. While Landorus-T can set up its own Stealth Rock, Spikes support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Forretress can help out greatly in racking up damage throughout the match. Forretress in particular can use Volt Switch in tandem with Landorus-T's U-turn to constantly shift momentum, making it an extremely effective partner.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Knock Off / Hidden Power Ice / Superpower
ability: Intimidate
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Jolly / Naive
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

Moves
========
Earthquake is Landorus-T's strongest attacking option, nailing opposing Pokemon weak or neutral to the move for good damage. Stone Edge compliments Earthquake very well, hitting opposing Flying-types that are impervious to Landorus-T's STAB move of choice. U-turn gives Landorus-T a fast option of both finishing off weakened foes and switching out to favorable match-ups, particularly with expected switch-ins. The last move of choice, once again, relies upon which check you wish to combat against. Knock Off nails Trevenant and Bronzong for big damage and hinders potential switch-ins into the Scarf set, although repeated Knock Offs on the same target will lessen in power after the first use. Hidden Power Ice is coverage against things that resist the EdgeQuake combo, like Breloom, as well as added coverage against Gliscor and Garchomp. Superpower hits checks like Ferrothorn and Skarmory a bit harder than EdgeQuake, as well as keeps consistency against Air Balloon users such as Heatran and Excadrill.

Set Details
========
While 91 Base Speed by itself is middling, attaching a Choice Scarf to Landorus-T enables it to play the role of a fearsome revenge killer, as well as a powerful cleaner. Max investment in Speed, a positive nature and a Choice Scarf grants Landorus-T a respectable 464 Speed, enough to out-speed positive nature Base 150's like MegaAlakazam and MegaAerodactyl as well as +1 neutral nature Base 100 Pokemon. Naive is for sets that include Hidden Power Ice, Jolly is for any set with a different coverage move. The rest of the EV's are placed into Attack in order to maximize Landorus-T's damage output.

Usage Tips
========
The Scarf set, thanks to Intimidate, has a fairly easy time switching into most non-Ice or Water Physical attacks and into Electric- and Ground-type attacks, granting it the ability to strike quickly and often. Furthermore, access to Intimidate and its typing grant it the ability to combat some of the most common priority attacks in the game, such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, Lucario's Vacuum Wave and Scizor's Bullet Punch. This allows Landorus-T to differentiate itself from other users of Choice Scarf, who normally struggle against priority users out-speeding their attacks. As with most good Choice Scarf users, Choice Scarf Landorus-T plays an effective role as a revenge killer, but thanks to its massive Attack stat and Intimidate, which often forces switches, it is just as well versed mid-game as it is late game. The ability to predict switch-ins is vital for the Scarf set, as a correct selection of Stone Edge or a coverage move could quickly spell the end of a check, opening up a clean-up opportunity with Earthquake late in the match. A fast U-turn should never be neglected either: backed with Landorus-T's massive Attack, U-turn can quickly knock out weakened foes and allow for a quick switch-in, enabling momentum change. While it may be tempting to abuse a fast and powerful Earthquake or a strong Stone Edge, keep in mind that Choice Scarf locks you into one move after the initial selection process. Earthquake's predictability and Stone Edge's accuracy issues can be taken advantage of by smart players, so using the Scarf set to the best of its ability requires smart decision-making and careful attention to the opposing team. Landorus-T faces some competition from Landorus-I, who can pull off the same set with higher Speed and Sand Force, but Landorus-T's Intimidate and strength outside of Sand sets it apart from its cousin.

Team Options
========
As the Scarf set lacks any form of recovery, the removal of Stealth Rock is a great asset for Landorus-T, allowing it to switch in multiple turns without the fear of repeated hazard damage. Rapid Spin users like Starmie and Tentacruel pair well with Landorus-T, resisting Water and Ice attacks while drawing in Electric and Ground-type moves. You may opt to use a Defog user, such as Scizor, Latias or Latios, but keep in mind that the Scarf set also appreciates hazards of its own due to the switch-outs the set may cause. Wish support from Vaporeon or Jirachi is also welcome, giving the Scarf set more opportunities to switch in as the match progresses.

Double Booster
########
name: Double Booster
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Stone Edge
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant
evs: 48 HP / 252 Atk / 208 Spe

Moves
========
With access to two great boosting moves in Rock Polish and Swords Dance, Landorus-T can run an effective set that utilizes both moves, allowing it to deal with a variety of opposing playstyles. Rock Polish doubles Landorus-T's Speed stat, enabling it to out-pace practically every Pokemon in the tier. This is useful against fast offensive teams that could normally out-Speed Landorus-T and KO it. Swords Dance, on the other hand, doubles it already massive Attack stat, making it an effective wallbreaker that can deal with even the bulkiest of checks. Earthquake and Stone Edge provide excellent coverage by themselves, allowing neutral hits on most Pokemon outside of Breloom, Bronzong and Chestnaut. Boosted STAB Earthquake will put a dent in nearly anything, however, and most things that resist or are immune to Earthquake are dispatched handily by Stone Edge.

Set Details
========
An investment of 208 Speed EV's gives it enough EV's to out-Speed most relevant Pokemon that need to be out-sped before a Rock Polish boost. After a Rock Polish boost, Landorus-T hits 540 Speed, enough to out-speed +1 Base 110 threats such as Choice Scarf Keldeo and Choice Scarf Latios. An Adamant nature and full investment in Attacks endows it with an astonishing 427 Attack, ensuring that Landorus-T will it as hard as possible. The remaining 48 EV's are placed in HP to promote overall bulk. Leftovers is the primary item of choice, enabling Landorus-T to set up against walls or slower threats without the worry of repeated weak attacks. Lum Berry and Life Orb are decent alternatives, with the former preventing untimely status that could prevent a sweep while giving it set-up opportunities against status abusers and the latter adding additional punch to attacks both before boosting and after boosting.

Usage Tips
========
The primary role of the Double Booster set is to sweep, so it's mandatory to switch in on something that ensures a boosting opportunity. The choice of which boosting move to use entirely depends on what the structure of the opposing team is. Use Rock Polish if the opposing team is more offensive, preying on their lack of investment in Defense and upending their normal Speed advantage. Use Swords Dance if the opposing team is more defensive or stall-based,punching massive holes in bulky threats that would normally take Landorus-T's attacks with ease. While scoring a Rock Polish and a Swords Dance at the same time is tempting, Landorus-T often cannot afford the time it takes to set up both. Focusing on one move or the other is often more beneficial than risking taking a massive hit from a check or being phazed out. The Double Booster set is built for late game, particularly gaining an advantage as the last Pokemon standing where it cannot be phazed out by things like Skarmory and Hippowdon. This set, like the Scarf set, competes with Landorus-I's Double Booster set, but once again Intimidate and immediate power sets those two Pokemon apart.

Team Options
========
Hazard support could mean the difference between a OHKO and a 2HKO for the Double Booster set, so teammates that can set them up reliably are a plus. Ferrothorn, Skarmory and Forretress are all great choices for this role. While Double Booster Landorus-T seems like a juggernaut, there are certain threats that can switch in and hinder a sweep even after a Rock Polish or Swords Dance. Pokemon like Gliscor, Skarmory, Chesnaught, Hippowdon and opposing Landorus(-T) can come in fairly easy and either deal big damage or force Landorus-T out. Greninja makes an excellent offensive partner, utilizing its Protean ability to defeat almost all of these Physical threats with ease due to their low Special Defense and weaknesses to Water and Ice. Offensive lures are also great pairings with the Double Booster set, creating an offensive tandem while also dealing with specific checks that hinder a sweep. Ice Punch Lucario and Technician Breloom are good examples of lures that draw in particular threats and dispatch of them before they can react.

Other Options
########
With its 145 Attack stat, a Choice Band set seems like a no-brainer. While Choice Band can be very effective, its low Speed stat and predictability really let it down in the long run. A set using just one of Rock Polish or Swords Dance can be used similarly to the Double Booster set, dropping the second boosting move in favor of a coverage move, but a set like this runs into issues against either offensive teams or defensive teams, depending on which boosting move is dropped.

Gravity is an interesting and effective support move, turning checks like Skarmory, Bronzong and Zapdos into easy prey. Substitute eases switch-in prediction while also protecting Landorus-T from super effective moves, particularly strong priority moves. With the XY Sleep mechanics being reverted to the old standard, a Sleep Talk set has gained some viability, giving it both reliable recovery and a way to prevent status. However, its unreliable attacking options and lack of a phazing move leave much to be desired compared to other RestTalk users.

Checks & Counters
########
**Gliscor and Landorus(-T)**: Gliscor and opposing Landorus(-T) are among the most common switch-ins to Landorus-T, having the bulk to take most Physical attacks thrown at them and crippling Landorus-T with Toxic and Hidden Power Ice, respectively. However, Landorus-T can use Hidden Power Ice as well to dispatch of these checks quickly.

**Skarmory and Bronzong**: Both Skarmory and Bronzong are similar to Gliscor and Landorus(-T) in that they are immune to EQ and have massive Physical bulk, yet are without the 4x Ice weakness. Skarmory will eventually fall to boosted Stone Edges, though, while Bronzong has to deal with Knock Off. Both also are victim to Gravity, rendering them useless against Landorus-T.

**Rotom-W**: Rotom-W is immune to Earthquake and can either Burn Landorus-T or OHKO it with Hydro Pump, but it takes decent damage from Landorus-T's coverage moves and also dislikes Gravity.

**Breloom and Chesnaught**: Breloom and Chesnaught are the only Pokemon that resist the EdgeQuake combo, but Breloom is rather frail and hit hard with Hidden Power Ice or boosted Earthquakes.

**Trevenant and Gourgeist-S**: Trevenant and Gourgeist-S resist Earthquake, have access to Will-O-Wisp and have good overall bulk, but both must be wary of Knock Off.

**Speed Stat**: Base 91 Speed is pretty average, so faster threats such as Greninja and Kyurem-B and common Scarf users such as Rotom-W and Keldeo out-speed Landorus-T and take it out.

**Ice and Water Priority**: Landorus-T's typing also leaves it weak to priority attacks like Ice Shard and Aqua Jet, so Pokemon like Mamoswine and Azumarill can revenge kill it effectively.
