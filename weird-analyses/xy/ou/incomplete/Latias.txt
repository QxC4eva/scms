Overview
########

    Excellent Speed, typing and bulk allow it to perform a variety of roles in the metagame
    Great check to common Pokemon such as Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-W
    One of the best users of Defog
    Gets walled fairly easily by Fairy-, Dark, and Steel-types
    Faces competition with Latios
    Typing gives it a weakness to several important attacking types such as Dark, Ghost, Fairy, Ice, and Bug

Offensive Defog
########
name: Offensive Defog
move 1: Defog
move 2: Draco Meteor
move 3: Healing Wish / Roost
move 4: Surf / Psyshock
ability: Levitate
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

Moves
========

    One of the best users of Defog on offensive teams due to its excellent typing, bulk and Speed
    Differentiates itself from Latios with its greater bulk and Healing Wish
    Draco Meteor is Latias's most powerful STAB attack, dealing a large amount of damage to Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Charizard Y
    Healing Wish allows Latias to completely heal a weakened teammate once its job of Removing entry hazards is done. It is also Latias's main niche over Latios as a Defogger
    Roost can be used over Healing With if you prefer Latias to check threats such as Keldeo and Rotom-W more reliable
    Surf is used mostly for heatran, who would otherwise wall Latias
    Psyshock can be used as a secondary STAB option, hitting specially defensive Fairy-type Pokemon and Mega Venusaur much harder than latias's other coverage moves


Set Details
========

    Life Orb is used to give Latias a power boost to compensate for its only-above-average Special Attack
    Leftovers can be used, but being able to hit hard right off the bat is far more important on the offensive teams where this variation of Latias fits
    EVs and nature are standard
    Alternate spread of 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 Spe could be used to give Latias slightly more bulk and still allows it to outspeed Mega Pinsir
    Thunderbolt and HP Fire can be used as alternative coverage moves


Usage Tips
========

    Latias can generally function well in any point of the match due to the utility of Defog and Healing Wish
    Functions better on more offensive team
    Pursuit trappers and Pokemon with the ability defiant are generally troublesome to Latias, so it is best to have these Pokemon eliminated before bringing Latias in


Team Options
========

    Heatran is an excellent partner for Latias, as it does well against Fairy- and Steel-types that generally threaten it, while also appreciating Healing Wish's recovery effect due to its lack of reliable recovery
    Choice Band Talonflame is an excellent partner, as Latias can remove Stealth Rock and heal it with Healing Wish

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mnd
move 2: Dragon Pulse
move 3: Roost
move 4: Psyshock / Reflect
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 248 HP / 44 Def / 216 Spe

Moves
========

    Calm Mind boost Latias's special attack and Special Defense to extremely high levels, allowing her to sweep late-game
    Dragon Pulse is Latias's main STAB move due to its great neutral coverage and decent base power
    Roost recovers Latias's HP
    Psyshock is Latias's secondary STAB move, hitting a majority of common Fairy-types for decent damage
    Reflect can be used, as it allows Latias to check physical attackers such as Terrakion better and weakens the damage of priority attacks that may interfere with her sweep
    Substitute and Refresh are OK moves in the last slot to avoid status
