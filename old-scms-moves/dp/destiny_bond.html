[SHORT DESC]
If the user faints, the foe faints.

[LONG DESC]
<p>If the user faints before their next move, the Pok√©mon that fainted the user will faint as well. This does not take into account any end-of-turn damage, such as hail, sandstorm, Leech Seed, status, Doom Desire, or Future Sight. If a Pokemon uses Destiny Bond, switches next turn, and faints to Pursuit as it switches, the Pursuit user faints as well.</p>
