<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Tiers are Smogon's way of categorizing Pokémon based on usage. Pokémon can be banned from the tier or move up to higher tier from their usage. Typically, they are updated after three months of usage statistics from Smogon's simulator, <a href="/sim/">Pokemon Showdown</a>. The initial tiers that will be endorsed by Smogon in XY are OverUsed (OU), Ubers, Little Cup (LC), and Doubles. As the generation progresses, tiers under OU will be progressively added to the mix (UnderUsed [UU], RarelyUsed [RU], and NeverUsed [NU] most likely), but for now, these are all of the officially supported tiers.</p>
    
<h2>Pokébank OU vs. XY OU</h2>
    <p>The Pokébank is an upcoming app for the 3DS that allows for transfer of BW and BW2 Pokémon to XY. It will be released in January. For now, anything only available from previous generations is banned from Smogon's current standard tier. However, Pokébank is the most widely played of the two, and allows for everything that will be available after its release. Note that items will not be available for transfer. All tiers currently have an XY and Pokébank ladder on Pokemon Showdown.</p>
    
<h2>Ubers</h2>
    <p>Ubers is a tier that has no limits besides the most basic ones; only the necessary clauses for metagame balance restrict what players can use. No Pokémon are banned, essentially.</p>
        <ul>
             <li><strong>Endless Battle Clause:</strong> Any moveset on any Pok&eacute;mon that is capable of intentionally causing an endless battle is banned from competitive play.
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>Specifically, it is baned for a Pok&eacute;mon to hold a Leppa Berry and varry Heal Pulse, Recycle, and a recovery move (Milk Drink, Moonlight, Morning Sun, Recover, Roost, Slack Off, Softboiled, or Wish) on its moveset.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Moody Clause:</strong> Pokémon with the ability Moody are not permitted.</li>
		</ul>
    <h3>Play Restrictions (XY and Pokébank Ubers)</h3>
		<ul>
            <li><strong>OHKO Clause:</strong> A Pokemon may not have the moves Fissure, Guillotine, Horn Drill, or Sheer Cold in its moveset.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep Clause:</strong> Only one Pokémon may be put to sleep on the opposing team at a time, if not induced by a move such as Rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Species Clause:</strong> Players cannot have two Pokémon with the same Pokédex number on the same team.</li>
            <li>Pokémon may be up to level 100.</li>
        </ul>

<h2>OverUsed</h2>
    <p>OverUsed, or OU, is Smogon's standard tier. The highest level of play is generally seen in this tier, and it is the basis for all other tiers. The most powerful Pokémon are banned from this tier up to Ubers. Pokemon cannot rise from OU to Ubers based on usage. Most of the cover legendaries in addition to select other Pokémon are on the banlist.</p>
