<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>BrightPowder is one of those items that, along with Quick Claw and Focus Band, will make you want to tear your hair out when playing in-game—it only very rarely makes a difference, but when it does, it will change the outcome of a game—especially if you're playing in the Battle Subway, where these items crop up everywhere. However, unlike the other two, BrightPowder stacks with abilities such as Sand Veil, making it far more likely that your opponent will miss, though Sand Veil and Snow Cloak are banned from all of Smogon's standard metagames.</p>

<p>BrightPowder is usable in VGC too, but the chances of it making a difference are statistically quite small, at least compared to other items such as Sitrus Berry or a Gem. It does help to make some inaccurate moves, such as Rock Slide and Heat Wave, even more inaccurate, however. Be sure that if it does make a difference, however, your opponent is likely to be, well, somewhere between livid and murderous. Good luck.</p>
