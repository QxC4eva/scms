[SHORT DESC] 
If the wielder is at full HP, it will survive any attack. OHKO moves will fail.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p><a href="/bw/moves/fissure">Fissure</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/guillotine">Guillotine</a>, <a href="/bw/moves/horn_drill">Horn Drill</a>, and <a href="/bw/moves/sheer_cold">Sheer Cold</a> will fail when used against the wielder. If at 100% health, any move that would normally KO the user in one hit will leave it at 1 HP instead. Multi-hit moves can KO through Sturdy, as does <a href="/bw/moves/destiny_bond">Destiny Bond</a>. <a href="/bw/moves/final_gambit">Final Gambit</a>, however, will not. Sturdy will allow the holder to survive the first hit of a multi-hit move like <a href="/bw/moves/fury_attack">Fury Attack</a>, but it will be KOed on the second. Sturdy prevents the user from OHKOing itself by confusion damage while it is at full HP. Does not protect the holder from OHKOing itself from recoil damage. The wielder will have its ability activate before <a href="/bw/items/focus_sash">Focus Sash</a>, so Focus Sash has no effect on a Pokemon with Sturdy.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>Sturdy is a great ability; providing that the wielder is at 100% health, they will more than likely last the turn with at least 1 HP. Sturdy has some awesome users, like <a href="/bw/pokemon/skarmory">Skarmory</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/forretress">Forretress</a>, <a href="/bw/pokemon/donphan">Donphan</a>, and the <a href="/bw/pokemon/aggron">Aggron</a> family, all perfectly capable of using Sturdy to its fullest. The most "off the wall" Sturdy user has to be <a href="/bw/pokemon/aron">Aron</a>, who coupled with an immunity to sandstorm, can single-handedly decimate teams even at level 1, using <a href="/bw/moves/endeavor">Endeavor</a>, <a href="/bw/items/shell_bell">Shell Bell</a>, and sandstorm to KO many Pokemon whilst keeping itself intact due to Sturdy. It is very competitively viable and many BW matches will involve a Sturdy user.</p>
