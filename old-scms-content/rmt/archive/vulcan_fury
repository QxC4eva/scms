<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The release of HeartGold and SoulSilver has undoubtedly shifted the metagame a bit&mdash;the rise of Shadow Sneak Giratina-O and Brave Bird Ho-Oh quite interestingly left the metagame focused on Dragon and Fire Attacks. Stall teams saw a rise as Ho-Oh's immense bulk and power filled in many gaps in them. This, in turn, caused the metagame to move its attention towards entry hazards and more on offense, which in turn caused stall to decline as people overprepare for them. This is evident in august's henry, where he abused Spikes and Stealth Rock and popularized Hidden Power Fire/Shadow Sneak Giratina-O. However in this rabble a few Pokemon were forgotten...</p>

<p>This team attempts to showcase the utility of a few undervalued Pokemon, specifically Heatran and Latias. These two Pokemon are currently "anti-metagame", because they destroy a large part of it. The rare Trick Scarf Deoxys-S and Scarf Jirachi also make appearances that perform crucial roles for the team. The team also combines the common "semistall" and offensive playstyles, given the quick entry hazards, but also some good bulk provided by just about everything in the team! How exactly do you classify this team? Flashstorm1 called it "offensive balance", and Ace Matador called it "Semistall". You know what I think? Forget team classification! It's a team of Pokemon, period. (Theorymon says "Right on Jibaku!")</p>

<p>As proof of this team's success I've gotten to #2 with it a few times (couldn't be bothered to get to #1 because I already accomplished that twice before ANYWAYS...it peaked at 1829 so it's good enough). However, as with any RMT, I need help&mdash;this team suffers from a few problems in which I can't seem to cover up.A main issue of this team is that it's a bit unstable - it sort of falls to hax, and unlike my previous Stall teams it relies too much on haxing back to regain the advantage. Speaking of that, another problem with the team is that it requires thought and whenever I'm in a tilt, this team fails me =(</p>

<p>This is probably the final 4th generation team I will make. With 5th gen stepping closer to our doorsteps, there isn't a whole lot of time left. Of course, if ARCEUS (and I mean Arceus, not "Farceus" or "Farkeus" depending on how you want to pronounce it....) comes out before then, it may be a different story. To go out with a bang, I've put my utmost effort into creating this team, putting comprehensive information and organizing them so they would be easy to read.</p>

<p>Like my previous teams, I will tell you right now I might lie on the EV spreads, but if you can suggest a better EV spread, please do so =). Without further ado...</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<h3>The Entry Hazard Core</h3>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/389.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Deoxys-S</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br/ >
Ability: Pressure<br/ >
EVs: 244 HP / 40 Def / 174 SpD / 52 Spe<br/ >
Careful Nature<br/ >
- Spikes<br/ >
- Taunt<br/ >
- Superpower<br/ >
- Trick</p>

<p><strong>General Information</strong><br />
Even with Deoxys-S leads being prepared for nowadays, it still remains as the most consistent lead in the metagame, setting up hazards with relative ease. This Deoxys-S lead differs from the general Spikes / Stealth Rock / Taunt / ExtremeSpeed lead, however, as it is a dedicated Spiker. Since this team is focused around entry hazards, I decided that splitting up Stealth Rock on another Pokemon would overall be beneficial to the team as putting both hazards on Deoxys-S places too much pressure on it and should situations come up where only one hazard can be put up (e.g. vs. Lead Tyranitar), it would throw over the focus of the team. Anyways, this is a TrickScarfer lead, which isn't seen at all nowadays. Its main advantage over the standard Deoxys-S is laying down Spikes before Scarf Shaymin-S/Scarfrai attack. This thing has a surprising amount of bulk which I will discuss later.</p>

<p>Also I find it quite weird that some Deoxys-S runs only ExtremeSpeed as their sole attacking move. I mean come on, would you really give up your coverage against other Deoxys-S to defeat Deoxys-A?</p>

<p><strong>Moveset Explanation</strong><br/ >
Well Spikes is outright obvious, and Taunt is still useful in halting opposing set ups once I've tricked the Scarf onto something. Superpower is only for times I may actually need to attack - it helps greatly with Darkrai. I've considered Pursuit since most Deoxys-S leads Taunt me and it would be funny to chop them up a little bit as they switch with Pursuit, but I decided to scrap the idea because I don't want stuff like Scizor coming in and Pursuiting my hazardmon.</p>

<p><strong>EV Explanation</strong><br/ >
With Choice Scarf patching its Speed (which is already insane to begin with), moving the EVs into the defenses seem logical. With these EVs, Leadquaza will almost never KO it with LO Fire Blast + ExtremeSpeed, and most of the time they won't OHKO with Draco Meteor anyways. Shaymin-S will 3HKO at best with Air Slash so I get three layers of Spikes against it. If I Trick against Forretress, Payback will not 2HKO me if I snag Leftovers. Also, it survives Crunch from SpecialTar lead after sand. The Speed EVs are only there so that it can outrun a Rock Polish Jolly Groudon at +2 while having a Choice Scarf attached, so that I may cripple it.</p>

<p><strong>Lead Explanation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deoxys-S:</strong> Trick allows me to at least cripple opposing Deoxys-S. If they Taunt, we both switch. I usually switch to Groudon to hopefully catch their Pursuiter and set up rocks immediately. If they attack with Signal Beam or Shadow Ball, I get my one layer, then switch to Groudon and set up the Stealth Rock. If they use SR or Spikes I just go for my three layers. However, battling against three layers worth of Spikes is rather annoying, but I do have two Levitators so I might not be at a huge loss here.</p>

<p><strong>Deoxys-A:</strong> I usually go for the Spikes here, then switch out to Jirachi to attempt an Ironflinch. If it uses ExtremeSpeed on the first turn, I get two layers of Spikes down</p>

<p><strong>Groudon:</strong> Spikes twice, generally. If it uses Stealth Rock I get three Spikes. After Deoxys-S is dead Groudon is sent out and Stealth Rocks, then Roars.</p>

<p><strong>Kyogre:</strong> Spikes twice (Deoxys-S will survive a Surf barring a crit), then Latias is sent out to handle Kyogre. Although it'll get paralyzed by Thunder Wave, it would weaken Kyogre to the point where it would be hard to use and making it easier to preserve my sunlight. Water Spout Kyogre can be annoying as it OHKOes Deoxys-S, however</p>

<p><strong>Dialga:</strong> There are a few ways I can do this. Deoxys-S will survive two Flamethrowers from lead Dialga so if it goes by that route I get three layers. To destroy Deoxys by the second turn, it must use Draco Meteor, which then allows Groudon to set up SR without too much of a threat. On certain occasions when I feel trollish I can Trick as it Thunder Waves. Lum Berry will cure me of paralysis and Dialga's left choiced, allowing for easy Spikes set up.</p>

<p><strong>Darkrai:</strong> I would just Spikes, and then take the Dark Void. I usually then go to Jirachi to scout for whatever they have. Deoxys-S will also survive a Dark Pulse so it can get two layers down. Signal Beam may come in handy once in a while</p>

<p><strong>Mew:</strong> Yeah it'll probably use U-turn so I'll use Spikes. Scizor will probably come in after (or Giratina-O), and I'll try to handle them by double switching etc (read later)</p>

<p><strong>Scizor:</strong> Spikes, then try to predict between Bullet Punch and Pursuit in order to get that second Spikes. If it Pursuits Deoxys-S correctly Groudon comes in and sets up SR so I'm not at a huge loss.</p>

<p><strong>Giratina-O:</strong> See Scizor, except I can't send in Groudon (Heatran is sent in instead). However, Giratina-O doesn't have Pursuit, which makes it easier to preserve Deoxys-S. On some occasions I catch it on the double switch as it uses Earthquake, sacrificing Deoxys-S' life to reveal their surprise. Shadow Sneak crits are extremely annoying, though.</p>

<p><strong>Rayquaza:</strong> Not too bad. I would just stay in against those who use Life orb leadrays, getting two layers of Spikes if they opt for Fire Blast + ES. If they Draco Meteor I'll probably survive and switch into Groudon while I set up Stealth Rock. Focus Sash LeadRay is handled in the same way, I guess</p>

<p><strong>Shaymin-S:</strong> One of the prime targets for Scarf Deoxys-S - it will most likely Air Slash and cause the team's demise as Deoxys-S effortlessly manages three layers of Spikes against it. It can 2HKO Deoxys-S with Seed Flare, though.</p>

<p><strong>Forretress:</strong> Trick severely cripples Forretress. They often Payback on the first turn which easily nets me two layers of Spikes. Then, Groudon can set up SR as it is forced to switch out. If they use Toxic Spikes I'll just spam Spikes while if they use Spikes I'll probably Taunt and set up Spikes of my own. If Forretress uses Rapid Spin it loses since Leftovers outheals the damage lol.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Replacements:</strong></p>
<img src="/download/sprites/dp/205.png" alt="" />
<p>I am considering <strong>Forretress</strong> over <strong>Deoxys-S</strong>, whose ability to stop most other Deoxys-S leads better and being able to lay down Toxic Spikes help this team quite a bit, slowing down sweepers and torturing Blissey. Oh and being a third Steel type helps. However, this means I have less control over the early game (which you can see in the Deoxys-S vs leads section - most notably against Rayquaza lead). Also, Forretress lead mirrormatches are stupid -_-, and I can't really lead with Groudon since I don't want to risk the possibility of them having Deoxys-S + Giratina-O. I would have to use Gyro Ball though, because the thought of Darkrai Nasty Plotting on Forry is scary considering my Scarfer can't even OHKO it. Since Forry often only carries Payback as an attacking move (Rapid Spin does NOT count!), Darkrai could easily set up without having to Dark Void which could put me in a horrid position. However, this would unfortunately force me to use Shed Shell to avoid Wobbuffet (this is significant as Deoxys-S can Taunt Forry and then Wobbuffet gets sent in, and if I happen to use Rapid Spin at that time Wobb could Encore and then proceed to Counter me to death!). Another option is to use Bug Bite which means I wouldn't have to lower Speed and therefore I can use Leftovers without fearing Wobb, but it does pathetic damage to Giratina-O (which then forces me to treat Forry as sacrifice against EQ variants, though I'd get a lot of hazards in the process). Bug Bite also has the added bonus of dealing tons of damage to lead Mew thanks to its Lum Berry. But unlike Gyro Ball, Rayquaza laughs at it. Using Gyro Ball with enough Speed to beat Wobb is a terrible idea X_X. The final option is to drop Toxic Spikes for Bug Bite...and I don't want to remove TS because that's the main reason Forretress is here, and I'm certainly not removing Spikes either!</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/91.png" alt="" />
<p>Okay I will admit that after testing <strong>Cloyster</strong> a bit with a set of Ice Beam / Rapid Spin / Toxic Spikes / Spikes @ Sash, it's not bad. Against slower leads and stall it gets Toxic Spikes + Spikes down easily, while Spinning away at Deoxys-S leads as well as threatening Giratina-O switch ins with Ice Beam. But I dunno - Cloyster is still fairly slow and isn't as versatile as Deoxys-S in terms of leading, and dislikes being put up against Forretress. What this thing can do that Forretress can't is set up both TS and Spikes against lead Kyogre and Dialga (barring fast ones, though). Obviously the main appeal here that it has over Deoxys-S is being able to lay down Toxic Spikes.</p>

<p>This Deoxys-S used to be a lead with 144 Atk / 252 Speed / 112 SAtk, Naive, Fire Punch / Spikes / Taunt / Signal Beam. However, ScarfDeoxys-S' ability to outrun Scarfrai and Scarfmin-S eventually gave the Sashlead the bootout from the team. Still, it performed its job exceptionally well while it was on the team. If for any reason Scarf Deoxys-S fails me, I can return back to this lead.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/383.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Groudon</strong> @ Leftovers<br/ >
Ability: Drought<br/ >
EVs: 252 HP / 56 Def / 162 SpD / 40 Spe<br/ >
Impish Nature<br/ >
- Earthquake<br/ >
- Stone Edge<br/ >
- Stealth Rock<br/ >
- Roar</p>

<p><strong>General Information</strong><br />
For a team that focuses on Heatran, Groudon is pretty darn important. It sets up sunlight, and of course, Stealth Rock. After this Groudon's only job left to complete is checking random physical attackers and absorbing Electric-type moves such as Thunder Wave and Thunder. Nothing else to describe in this short section eh?</p>

<p><strong>Moveset Explanation</strong><br/ >
The EV spread is quite different from the standard&mdash;instead of focusing solely on physical defense, some special defense are thrown in. This spread, in particular, allows it to survive Life Orb +2 Darkrai's Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock damage. Although it's unreliable, it can help in pinch situations. Groudon can also beat Scarf Palkia one on one (if Palkia has taken entry hazard damage). The Speed EVs seem excessive, but they outrun most Ho-Oh in the game, which is essential as the team does not enjoy facing Ho-Oh. It will also help against the slow base 90s.</p>

<p><strong>EV Explanation</strong><br/ >
Earthquake is self explanatory, while Stone Edge smashes Ho-Oh and Rayquaza. As for the last moveslot, I've had Rest before, because Blissey isn't friendly to the team. However, I think Roar is better overall, despite having another phazer. This allows me to escape the wrath of Double Dance Groudon once, and allows Latias to use Thunder instead of Grass Knot.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/504.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Giratina-O</strong> @ Griseous Orb<br/ >
Ability: Levitate<br/ >
EVs: 248 Atk / 60 SpA / 200 Spe<br/ >
Naive Nature<br/ >
- Hidden Power Fire / Earthquake<br/ >
- Shadow Sneak<br/ >
- Draco Meteor<br/ >
- Dragon Claw</p>

<p><strong>General Information</strong><br />
Well obviously I'm not going to go without a spinblocker, right? Despite having Fire Punch on Deoxys-S, I still would like to prevent Forretress from Spinning away all of the hard work I went to get them up (read: it's not hard, but if Deoxys-S dies I'd rather not see its effort wasted). Giratina-O also provides the team with the ever so useful Fighting and Ground immunities (well, Latias already has Ground immunity, but this helps, no?) Also helps beat down Rock Polish Groudon. And Mewtwo. And Adamant Lucario. And helps tremendously against Stall. And even helps absorb Explosions/Selfdestructs, Etc. You get it, right? By these reasons you should understand why Giratina-O is picked over Giratina-A, or any other Spinblocker really (because they're either pretty darn frail (Gengar, Rotom-A), silly (Dusknoir, Spiritomb), doesn't have Levitate (a lot of them), and they don't work as great vs Stall or Mewtwo).</p>

<p><strong>Moveset Explanation</strong><br/ >
Hidden Power Fire is for the obvious "getting rid of Forretress" theme which has been recurring in this team, but I am considering Earthquake because it allows me to outrun all other Giratina-O (due to having max Speed IV - and this would mean I need to move EVs into Speed, obviously) and of course, to get rid of Heatran, but I'm scared of enemy Skarmory and Bronzong who shrugs off everything. Shadow Sneak is pretty self explanatory as it helps clean up soo much stuff it's not even funny. Draco Meteor crushes Rock Polish Groudon and deals massive damage in general. Lastly, Dragon Claw is reliable and can allow me to hit Blisseys who might switch into it (trust me they sometimes do, probably to lock you into Outrage or something...whatever). The reason Outrage isn't needed here is because I have Latias, who can tear up Kyogre anyways. Ho-Oh is a slight issue though, but I can switch to Groudon during the Roost and tear it apart with Stone Edge.</p>

<p><strong>EV Explanation</strong><br/ >
The EVs are pretty much the same as in the analysis, with extra Speed to outrun most other Giratina-O. It's focused on Attack because I want to hurt Blissey with Dragon Claw, and increase my chances of 2HKOing Mewtwo with Shadow Sneak. That doesn't mean Draco Meteor won't hurt, though&mdash;STABed 140 BP *1.2 move is still pretty devastating in its own right</p>

<p><strong>Final Words</strong><br/ >
Giratina-O's typing allows it to be a tremendous partner to Heatran and Jirachi. Jirachi + Giratina-O can smack down Psychic types effectively while Heatran + Giratina-O is plain annoying to face =). Just ask tito!</p>

<h3>The Team Focus(es)</h3>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/490.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Heatran</strong> @ Leftovers<br/ >
Ability: Flash Fire<br/ >
EVs: 252 HP / 104 SpD / 152 Spe<br/ >
Calm Nature<br/ >
- Taunt<br/ >
- Roar<br/ >
- Dragon Pulse / <strong>Toxic</strong><br/ >
- Flamethrower</p>

<p><strong>General Information</strong><br />
Quite an underrated mon. It's slowly rising in usage though. Heatran is an excellent Pokemon in the Uber metagame due to its resistance to Dragon and Fire and immunity to Toxic Spikes, and in this team it full well takes advantage of that trait. As I said before, with the metagame focusing on Fire + Dragon, this stuff is useful. And it can actually hurt stuff besides walling them too. Heatran sort of suffers from having no recovery, however.</p>

<p><strong>Moveset Explanation</strong><br/ >
In case you haven't been paying attention to the Heatran thread in the Ubers subforum, Roar can give a lot of headaches as their Heatran counters are sent in, take loads of entry hazard damage, and are promptly forced back out. Since Heatran handles many Pokemon, it might just drag out a Pokemon it normally scares off. And it has the option to stay in and probably die, or switch out and risk Roar. As you see, Heatran is an excellent phazer, and I'm sure you'd probably agree. Taunt harasses Stall teams to the extreme&mdash;it means Blissey can't recover, then I can roar it out and add more entry hazard damage. Furthermore, I can Taunt Blissey and switch into Giratina-O, which decimates Blissey. Taunt also messes up Lugia, Giratina-A, and Lugia =). So yeah, this is my second weapon against stall. By messing around with their head, Heatran and the rest of the team prey on the opponent's deteriorating composure.</p>

<p>Flamethrower is chosen for reliability, and the power is generally preferred over the burn from Lava Plume. I am no way using Fire Blast or Overheat, they suck -_-. Fire Blast has imperfect accuracy and terrible PP, and where Pressure is flying about AND the fact that it's supposed to be a defensive Pokemon makes it a terrible choice. Overheat is worse due to the -2 Special Attack, which means Taunt / WoW Mewtwo outstalls me =(. Dragon Pulse is for immediate damage to Dragons (unless they're Latias or Dialga). I am considering Toxic in this spot, though, because it helps a lot against Latias and Lugia, and does wonders if I didn't get enough entry hazards when this is sent out.</p>

<p><strong>EV Explanation</strong><br/ >
The EVs give it enough speed to outrun most Ho-Oh (see: Groudon). Rest are just dumped into HP and SDef for overall bulk. With no recovery in hand, Heatran must tread carefully against powerful NVE attacks such as Dialga's Choice Specs Draco Meteor or Ho-Oh's Brave Bird. For this reason, I carry Jirachi as a secondary Steel to absorb hits when I feel that I must preserve Heatran.</p>

<p><strong>Final Words</strong><br/ >
Heatran holds the team against Scarf Dialga / Scarf Palkia (in the sun), Earthquakeless Ho-Oh, Taunt / WoW Mewtwo, Lugia, Earthquakeless Giratina-O, TormentTran, and much, much more...the list is quite endless.</p>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/380.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Latias</strong> @ Soul Dew<br/ >
Ability: Levitate<br/ >
EVs: 160 HP / 96 SpA / 252 Spe<br/ >
Timid Nature<br/ >
- Dragon Pulse<br/ >
- Calm Mind<br/ >
- Recover<br/ >
- Thunder</p>

<p><strong>General Information</strong><br />
Yeah uhhm so apparently her usage declined. I mean, what IS this?<br/ >
| 20 | Latias | 2261 | 9.27 | <br/ >
(January stats)</p>

<p>| 22 | Latias | 3394 | 10.45 | <br/ >
(April stats)</p>

Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. This is unacceptable! :RAGE:

<p>Anyways, I consider Latias to be an anti metagame Pokemon at this point. It appeared that people forgot her existence and thus many teams are weak to her. Latias is probably the best partner to Heatran in the game because not only do they counter each other's weaknesses, they are pretty destructive to sun (Heatran), and rain (Latias) teams. Furthermore, being one of the best counters to Kyogre in the game, Latias secures the team's purpose of abusing Heatran.</p>

<p>What makes Latias so dangerous? She has no Uber counters, and thus you're left with Scizor/Jirachi/Tyranitar/Blissey/Registeel as your best bets to stop her. Scizor gets 2HKOed by Thunder and is mauled by the entry hazards in the team, Jirachi doesn't like Thunder either, Tyranitar is sort of rare, and Registeel is even rarer. Which leaves Blissey, really. This means Latias will very, very often snag a kill in the game, and may even sweep.</p>

<p><strong>Moveset Explanation</strong><br/ >
I picked the Calm Mind set as it is the most effective way to decimate Kyogre. Ice Beams don't hurt her a whole lot and is easily recoverable, unless they have Life Orb (where they just put themselves into Thunder kill range). Speaking of Thunder, I picked it to hit Steels and Lugia. Despite sunlight, Kyogre is common enough to make up for that.</p>

<p><strong>Choice Explanation</strong><br/ >
Latias is chosen over Palkia here because of her ability to Calm Mind, Recover, and because she is faster. Palkia struggles to fight off Calm Mind Kyogre and the inability to Recover (and being hit by the grounded entry hazards...) make it quite unreliable. She holds the team against Mixed Palkia as well, which apparently is something the rest of the Kyogre checks struggle to do. Being faster than Garchomp is invaluable as well.</p>

<p>Latias is picked over Latios for her better bulk. This is important because it allows her to hold against Kyogre easier as they may pack Ice Beam. I mean seriously, Latios gets 2HKOed by Specs Ogre's Surf with SR, as well as 2HKOed by Scarfed Water Spout. Furthermore, her extra defense allows her to survive priority moves better&mdash;she can survive a +2 Life Orb ExtremeSpeed from Jolly Lucario after two Stealth Rock damages (unless it rolls max damage or something).</p>

<h3>The Revenger</h3>

<img src="/download/sprites/dp/385.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Jirachi</strong> @ Choice Scarf<br/ >
Ability: Serence Grace<br/ >
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br/ >
Jolly Nature<br/ >
- Iron Head<br/ >
- Ice Punch<br/ >
- U-turn<br/ >
- Trick</p>

<p><strong>General Information</strong><br />
The glue...kind of I guess. I don't really like to Scarf Jirachi, since it has a lot of potential on doing other things, but due to the presence of Darkrai, Mewtwo, Rayquaza, and Lati@s, I am obligated to Scarf this. Turns out, Jirachi is a pretty good Scarfer. Scarfrachi's huge drawback is still the fact that it doesn't do a lot of damage due to its average Attack stat and fairly weak attacks, and thus often relies on super effective hits or the extremely cheap Ironflinch to deal good damage. However, its Steel/Psychic typing, reasonable bulk, and somewhat precise moveset more than makes up for this setback. Following the theme of this team, Jirachi is somewhat rare as well.</p>

<p><strong>Darkrai</strong><br/ >
I will mention Darkrai once more because it's an annoying Pokemon. It resists Shadow Sneak and has STAB Dark Pulse which limits my revenging capabilities. To defeat Darkrai, I usually have a Pokemon sent to sleep, switch in Jirachi, U-turn out to the Sleeping Pokemon and let it die to Darkrai, then send Jirachi back in to pick off the remaining HP (unless it's so low that Shadow Sneak can pick it off, which happens if Darkrai has Life Orb). Entry hazards prevent Darkrai from coming back in the second time around to Sleep another mon. I will only attempt an Ironflinch in desperate situations or when I know it will put Darkrai's HP into Shadow Sneak kill range.</p>

<p>You know, ScarfKitsunoh would fit so well over Scarf Jirachi here......</p>
