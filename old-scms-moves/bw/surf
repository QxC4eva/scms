[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deals damage. Any target using Dive is hit with double Base Power. In-game it allows you to travel across water.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>As one of the two competitive Hidden Machine moves, with high Base Power and perfect accuracy, Surf is available to almost every Water-type Pok√©mon and is often their main special STAB attack. However, due to the non-comprehensive cover of Water-type attacks, it should not be the only damaging move in the moveset, excluding niche Pokemon such as Crocune, or its user is easily walled by Grass-, Dragon-, and other Water-type Pokemon.</p>
