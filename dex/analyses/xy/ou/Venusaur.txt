Overview########
With its Mega Evolution, Venusaur is a tank that defines the metagame, walling a huge amount of Pokemon while hitting back hard. It has amazing bulk, few weaknesses thanks to its ability Thick Fat, fairly reliable recovery with Synthesis, and strong attacks. It's almost impossible to OHKO other than a Flying- or Psychic-type move, and even those usually need to be STAB. However, it lacks Leftovers, which hurts its defensive abilities, and it uses up the Mega slot, so there is a high level of opportunity cost when using it. It also suffers from not being able to run every move that it wants to. However, Mega Venusaur is a very prominent and dangerous Pokemon, and you will struggle with it if you are not prepared.

Moves
========
Synthesis is mandatory as a source of reliable recovery, without which Mega Venusuar will be quickly worn down. Sludge Bomb is a strong STAB attack that 2HKOes many offensive Pokemon. Giga Drain is also a great move, getting good coverage with Sludge Bomb, and it hits many of the Pokemon Mega Venusaur handles like Manaphy and Rotom-W. Power Whip can be used instead for more power, but Venusaur is often burned because of Rotom-W, so it's not reliable. Leech Seed gets chip damage and a little bit of recovery from everything that is not a Grass-type, and most Grass-types don't switch in in fear of Sludge Bomb. However, Earthquake hits Heatran, a common switch in, very hard, as well as other Steel-types like Aegislash and Bisharp. Hidden Power Fire can used for Scizor, Forretress, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn as well.Mega Venusaur also has a few other support moves that it can use. Sleep Powder will cripple one Pokemon for a few turns and can take out an important Mega Venusaur check of theirs. Roar will phaze out set up sweepers, and can rack up hazard damge. Knock Off will annoy almost every Pokemon and can be used to disrupt more. If these alternate moves are used, they should go in the fourth slot, as the other three are generally essential.

Set Details
========
The EVs give Mega Venusuar great mixed bulk. A Bold nature is used if you don't run any physical attacks; otherwise Relaxed is better, since Mega Venusaur's Speed isn't very important. Overgrow is unlikely to be useful, while Chlorophyll can be helpful against Sun before Mega Evolving, so that is the preferred ability. If Mega Venusaur is Bold, then 16 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed max Speed Mega Mawile and Azumarill. The EVs can be customized to your needs, since there are no vital benchmarks for Mega Venusaur.

Usage Tips
========
Try to Mega Evolve early so that Mega Venusaur can act as a tank all game. Talonflame and Mega Pinsir can try to set up on you, so it is important to keep pressure on them. Sludge Bomb does great damage to them on the switch. If you're unsure what a Pokemon is going to attack you with, Synthesis can be used to scout them Mega Venusaur is almost never OHKOed. Don't do this against set up sweepers, though. Mega Venusaur should use Synthesis often, since it is worn down by hazards easily, and it takes a lot of hits.

Team Options
========
Rotom-W is a good partner to take on all of the Flying-types that give Mega Venusuar trouble. Aegislash is also a good one that deals with most Psychic-types. Heatran has great synergy with Mega Venusaur and walls attackers that Mega Venusaur can't. Together, the two form a very potent defensive core. Mega Venusaur fits well on many different kinds of teams and does not need much support other than a way to cover its weaknesses.

Other Options
########
An Offensive Mega with maximum Special Attack can surprise opponents with its power. A Chlorophyll sweeper in the sun with Venusaur's base forme is usable on dedicated Sun teams, but sun is a mediocre strategy. SubSeed can be used with Mega Venusaur, but it's easily shut down. Other than its standard set, Venusaur doesn't have a huge amount of variety.

Checks & Counters
########
- **Steel-types**: Skarmory walls sets without Hidden Power Fire, does good damage with Brave Bird, and sets up hazards on Venusaur. Scizor can set up with Swords Dance on sets that lack it as well, and Ferrothorn can stack hazards on it. Heatran is an easy switch-in if it lacks Earthquake.

- **Psychic-types**: Latios and Latias can switch in fairly easily and threaten Venusaur out with Psyshock.

- **Flying-types**: Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Tornadus-T can do a lot of damage with their Flying-type attacks, although they don't enjoy Sludge Bomb. Crobat is rare but good counter as well, being able to Taunt it and hit hard with Brave Bird.

- **Set Up Sweepers**: Not all of them, but Volcarona and Dragonite can accrue boosts, and Garchomp can take a hit or two while it sets up a Swords Dance.

- **Tyranitar**: It can switch in, take little even from Giga Drain and bring sand that ruins Venusaur's recovery.

- **Gengar**: Gengar resists both STABs and is immune to Earthquake, so it can come in, set up a Substitute, and wear down Venusaur as long as it has some form of recovery.

- **Kyurem-B**: Thanks to Teravolt, its Ice Beam is still super effective and extremely powerful. It also has great bulk to switch in easily.
