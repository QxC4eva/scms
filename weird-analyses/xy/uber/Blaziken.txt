Overview
########

Blaziken takes the title of being the first, and currently sole, starter to be banished to Ubers thanks to its hidden ability Speed Boost. Speed boost is the only reason Blaziken became a pokemon in Ubers. With it, Blaziken is able to outspeed and KO many threats and pass on boosts to the rest of the team. Blaziken now makes its second debut in ubers with a new boon: a mega evolution. Blaziken continues to be a formidable threat to watch out for. With its new 100 base speed, it is able to come in and out speed much of the base 90 ubers metagame. It is able to use a physically offensive set to sweep opposing teams, and a life orb can be chosen along side this with the ability to run another mega evolution. However, Blaziken isn't held to only utilizing an offensive set. It is able to run a baton pass set effectively as well. The nerf to weather this generation is a mixed bag for Blaziken. Although it doesn't have everpresent sun support anymore, rain doesn't last forever. Rain used to weaken its Flare Blitz and lasted forever but now it only lasts 5 turns. So, Drought is no longer necessary to counter Kyogre's rain.

However, everything is not as perfect as it may seem for the speedy chicken. It has rather poor bulk even with its mega evolution which leaves it open to being revenge killed by priority, makes it rather tough to switch into, and difficult to set up a Swords Dance with. It also has dependancy on a recoil move, Flare Blitz which doesn't help with its rather poor bulk. Its mega evolution set, which is arguably its best set, represents a cost compared to using other megas such as Mewtwo and Gengar on your team. These factors shouldn't discount Blaziken's usefulness. Nevertheless, with proper switch in and set up, Blaziken is still a formidable threat to look out for.


Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Low Kick
move 2: Flare Blitz
move 3: Protect / Swords Dance
move 4: Protect / Knock Off
ability: Speed Boost
item: Blazikenite / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========
Low Kick is Blaziken's fighting type STAB. It is used as it deals its maximum damage against most of the targets you would use it against. Ubers consists of many heavy Pokemon and it doesn't include the damage from missing a High Jump Kick. Flare Blitz is Blaziken's fire type STAB. When used in conjunction with Low Kick, you can hit most of the commonly used Pokemon in Ubers for super effective and neutral damage. Swords Dance allows you to get a quick +2 to attack to massively increase damage output. Protect allows not only guranteed speed boosts, but also allows you to scout what move your opponent is going for. Knock off is another great utility move as it allows Blaziken to deal massive damage to direct resists to Flare Blitz and Low Kick in both Girantina forms. It also allows you to catch your opponent on a switch and lets you take off an otherwise useful item from the Pokemon they switch into. Baton pass can be used in this set to provide speed boosts for other team members when Blaziken is low. Make sure to use Protect with it as it gurantees speed boosts. High Jump Kick can be an alternative to Low Kick. It offers 10 more base power but if it misses, Blaziken deal massive damage to itself. It is a situational option as it only does damage to Quagsire which rarely sees use in Ubers. Stone edge can be used instead of Knock off if your team is lacking against Ho-oh. It also dents Lugia and physically defensive Yveltal.

Set Details
========
252 attack and 252 speed allow Mega Blaziken to come in and immediately get to work, attacking anything your opponent throws at you. It takes capitalizes on Blaziken's offensive stats and allow it to become the wallbreaker it is known as. The slashes represent three possible sets that you can run: Protect + 3 attacks, Swords Dance and three attacks and Swords Dance and Protect with 2 attacks. An Adamant nature is used so that your moves can deal more damage which allows you to OHKO Pokemon such as Kyogre not normally OHKO'd by Jolly. Jolly can be used over Adamant in order to boost Blaziken's speed and allow it to out speed scarfers such as Zekrom after one boost in its mega evolution or after two in its life orb set. However, it loses offensive prowess that it would normally enjoy. Life Orb Blaziken allows you to use another Pokemon that can mega evolve and benefit your team.

Usage Tips
========
Be wary about flat out switching Blaziken in as it has relatively low bulk which means that it easily takes heavy damage from everything and can possibly get OHKO'd if your not careful. Because of this, watch out for priority moves that can revenge kill you such as extreme speed on Arceus and Rayquaza. Using Protect allows you to gain +1 from speed boost to build momentum. It also offers added utility in allowing you to see what move your opponent was going for and allows you to utilize that information to your advantage. Don't just spam Flare Blitz blindly as the recoil racks up quickly and can leave Blaziken fairly vulnerable to revenge killers. If you opt for Knock off, it allows Blaziken to catch Pokemon on the switch and cripple them. It even allows more damage against Giratina which usually is able to take hits from Blaziken since it resists fire and is immune to fighting.

Team Options
========
Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rocks are really useful for Blaziken as it enjoys the extra damage from it done to Lugia, Ho-h, and Yveltal. This includes Pokemon such as Groudon and Landorus-T. Groudon can be used to help Mega Blaziken by setting up the sun and dispelling the rain which even allows Flare Blitz to do more damage. It also checks Ekiller Arceus as it can take hits and retaliate with an attack or thunder wave which cripples Arceus. You can run lava plume on Groudon in order to catch opposing Landorus-T off guard and score a burn. This leaves Landorus-T crippled for the rest of the match. Landorus-T as a team mate provides intimidate support and checks Ho-oh which counters Blaziken. It also carriest U-turn which allows Blaziken to get a free switch. Yveltal can wall break many of the Pokemon that can wall Blaziken such as Giratina forms. Xerneas can be used as another offensive sweeper and able to deal with both Giratina forms. Wobbuffet is an interesting team member as it is able to trap and take out any Pokemon that can check or counter Blaziken. It can be used with Xerneas with Hidden Power fire to create a powerful core.Palkia is a great team member as it can sponge water moves thrown at Blaziken and deal with Rayquaza that can revenge kill Blaziken. U-turn/Volt Switch users such as Genesect and Zekrom that can get Blaziken a free switch. E-killer Arceus can be a good team member as well. Blaziken is able to weaken the opponent's team by KOing or debilitating Arceus's checks. This allows Arceus to come in and sweep.


Baton Pass
########
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Protect
move 3: Substitute / Roar
move 4: Flare Blitz
ability: Speed Boost
item: Leftovers
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Baton Pass is the basis of this set. It is used to pass on the boosts you gain to another team member for use. Protect allows Blaziken to gain guaranteed speed boosts from it's ability and is absolutely necessary for this set. Substitute used in conjunction with Protect allows you the best option in getting speed boosts as you can alternate between them which allows Blaziken to get the boosts without fearing much damage. On the other hand, roar is an interesting option that allows you prevent Blaziken from being phazed out and losing its speed boosts. It also prevents opponent Pokemon from setting up on you. Flare Blitz provides a reliable and powerful physical fire-type STAB that allows you to deal with opposing Pokemon with taunt.

Set Details
========
252 Attack and 252 Speed allow Blaziken to switch in, use a protect and begin to outspeed the opponent while having respectable attack in case Flare Blitz needs to be used. By investing in attack, Blaziken is not a sitting duck to set up sweepers and can actually deal significant damage while gaining boosts to its speed stat. A Jolly nature is used here to make sure that you are able to use substitute after your first Protect. After one boost from Speed Boost, it is able to out speed much of the nonscarfed Ubers Pokemon This prevents Blaziken from taking severe damage or even being completely Knocked out. It's survival is necessary to pass on speed increases to the rest of the team. Leftovers is used for healing and to increase longevity. It works great in conjunction with protect as you get a speed boost and +6.25% recovery.

Usage Tips
========
Watch out for potential taunt users such as Deoxys-S as they can cripple this entire set as you wont be able to pass on your speed boosts. Protect is a cornerstone of this set allowing you to stay in and get speed boosts. It also provides utility as you can scout what move your opponent is going for which allows you to plan accordingly. A good strategy is to come and and use protect to get a speed boost. Then alternate to Substitute and continue to do so to pass your speed to another Pokemon. Also, a predicted switch allows you to use Substitute and then Protect on the next turn. This allows you to gain a speed boost after and the ability to pass on a Substitute to an another Pokemon on your team. Roar is used mainly to prevent Blaziken from being phazed out. It is faster than phazers after one speed boost, so its Roar will go first and prevent it from being switched out. Watch out for priority moves that can deal with you such as Extremespeed and Shadow Sneak. These moves are able to do significant damage which can cause you to lose a substitute or even take damage. By passing your speed boosts to another Pokemon that is powerful and normally slow, you are able to turn the tide against your opponent and potentially sweep their team with your offensive threat.

Team Options
========
Groudon can be used to help boost Blaziken's Flare Blitz by setting up the sun and dispelling the rain. It allows Flare Blitz to do more damage. Sun support also lowers damage from water moves. You can Baton Pass your speed boosts to terrifying offensive Pokemon with low speed. They appreciate its boosts as it allows them to pull of sweeps with their high power that is normally set back with lackluster speed. They include Life Orb and Choice Band Zekrom, Mega Kangaskhan, Life orb and Tank Ho-Oh, Lustrous Orb and Life Orb Palkia, Choice Specs Kyogre, and Choice Band Groudon. By passing to these Pokemon, you are able to use Baton Pass Blaziken to its fullest.


Other Options
########
Brave Bird can be utilized as it provides neutral damage against most Pokemon. However, the only common threats it hits for super effective damage are Mega Mewtwo-X and Arceus fighting. Both take massive damage from Flare Blitz as is. Otherwise, Brave Bird is another recoil move that shouldn't really be used over any other moves in any set. Rock slide can be used, but its main target is Ho-oh. Stone edge should be used for more damage to Yveltal and Lugia. Shadow claw can be used instead of Knock Off since Knock Off deals less damage to Mega Gengar and Giratina-O since their items can't be knocked off. However, you don't have it's utility against opposing tanks and switches by knocking off leftovers or choice items. Boosting moves such as Swords Dance and Bulk up can be used in the Baton Passing set. However, they have a marginal or nonexistent bonus for special attackers and require more turns to set up which limits Blaziken's longevity. Overheat can be used in the Baton Pass set to cut down on Recoil damage, but repeated usage causes it to deal less damage since it lowers Special Attack two stages and it also has a chance to miss. Choice Band can be used to grant Blaziken an immediate power boost, but it constricts it and is counterproductive with speed boost. Blaziken won't be able to switch attacks which allows it to be blocked by opposing tanks such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Fairy. This leads it having to switch out and lose its speed boosts.


Checks & Counters
########
**Giratina**: Both Giratina forms can take anything Blaziken throws at them except for boosted Knock Off and are able to eventually KO it or phaze it out.

**Gyarados**: Gyarados can come in and get an Intimidate on Blaziken while also resisting both of it's stab attacks. It can also threaten to KO Blaziken with Waterfall.

**Landorus-Therian**: It can switch in and take a hit with Defensive investment and Intimidate, although it doesn't appreciate boosted Flare Blitz. It is able to KO Blaziken with Earthquake as well.

**Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water**: Physically Defensive variants can tank a few hits. They each resist one of Blaziken's STABs, but don't appreciate the other STAB that it can go for.

**Arceus-Ghost**: It is immune to Blaziken's fighting type STAB and retaliate back with a Judgement. Consequently, it must be wary of Flare Blitz.

**Quagsire**: Unaware can ignore Blaziken's stat boosts and attack back with it's Water type and Earth type STABs. It doesn't fare well against High Jump Kick though.

**Kyogre**: It is able to come in and set up the rain which severely limits Blaziken's coverage. This can help out Pokemon that resist/immune to Blaziken's fighting STAB such as Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Ghost. It also threatens to KO Blaziken with its Water type STAB attacks.

**Phazers**: They are able to Whirlwind/Roar/Dragon tail the Baton Pass set. They can also force the Offensive set out which cancels out its speed boosts.

**Prankster Users**: Pokemon such as Thundurus and Klefki can take advantage of Prankster. They can use Thunder wave which cripples the offensive set. Taunt from Thundurus shuts down the BP set.

**Poison**: Poison limits Blaziken's longeviry as it increases in damage each turn. Especially useful against the Baton Pass set as it lowers the time Blaziken can stay in which lowers the amount of boosts that it can pass on.

**Revenge Killers**: Pokemon such as Arceus-Normal and Rayquaza with Extremespeed are able to revenge kill Blaziken due to its paltry bulk and from prior damage due to recoil.
