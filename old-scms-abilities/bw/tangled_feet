Evasion increases when confused.

[LONG DESC]
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the wielder is confused, its evasion rate is doubled. This effect ends when the confusion ends.</p>

<h2>Competitive Use</h2>
<p>There is literally no competitive use to this ability. Even if you do somehow manage to get the boost with one of the seven awful Pokemon that have the ability, the chances of you getting hit by confusion are far greater than the opponent missing its attack on you, unless it is using something such as <a href="/bw/moves/dynamicpunch">DynamicPunch</a>, which normally misses anyway.</p>
