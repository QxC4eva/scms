<h2>What is Glitchmons?</h2>

<p>Glitchmons, at its base, is a metagame that has no clauses, no bans, or anything that would hinder your team-making skills, outside of stuff you cannot obtain in-game without the use of hacking. While that sounds fairly simple, look back at the name. Glitchmons. Glitches aren't hacking, now are they? For those who remember, the Mimic glitch in the Japanese Diamond and Pearl game meant that any Pokémon with access to Mimic, and by extension Copycat, Metronome, Transform, and Assist in Diamond and Pearl, had the ability to learn any move that existed in the fourth generation, as well as a single Generation V move from access to Sketch!<p>

<h3>Rules:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are no clauses or bans that are in standard tiers.</li>
<li>Any Pokémon with Mimic, Copycat, Metronome, Transform, and Assist can learn any move from the fourth generation, as well as a single Generation V move, in addition to its pre-existing movepool.</li>
<li>While not a rule per se, please remember ability legality issues&mdash;many Pokémon learn Mimic through the third generation&mdash;meaning something like Scrappy Miltank, which it gets in the fourth generation, would not be able to access the Mimic Glitch, as well as many LC Pokémon, as abilities can be gained through evolution.</li>
</ul>
