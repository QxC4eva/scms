        Mold Breaker is a good ability in theory, but nearly useless on Mega-Ampharos

    RestTalk
    ########
    name: RestTalk
    move 1:Volt Switch
    move 2:Dragon Pulse
    move 3:Rest
    move 4:Sleep Talk
    ability:Static
    item:Ampharosite
    evs:252 HP / 44 SpA / 192 SpD / 20 Spe
    nature:Modest

    Moves
    ========

        Volt Switch switch keeps up momentum and is decently powerful.

        Dragon pulse is Mega Ampharos’s only dragon stab, and is the most powerful attack on the set.

        Together these have great neutral coverage, only being notably resisted by Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Whimsicott, and Magnezone.

        Rest keeps Mega Ampharos healthy, and allows it to shrug off any status, making it a complete counter to Rotom Wash.

        Sleep Talk keeps Mega Ampharos from being a sitting duck after Resting.
        Focus Blast can be used over SleepTalk if the team has a cleric, although Sleep Talk is generally better

    Set Details

        252 Hp is to take hits as well as possible, as this set's job is to switch into hits
        20 Speed allows Mega Ampharos to outspeed 0 speed hippowdon, and 44 Special attack allows it to 2hko 252 HP/0 Spd Hippowdon. The rest is in Special Defensive, as most of the hits Mega Ampharos is supposed to tank are special
        RestTalk is a much more viable strategy now due to the new sleep mechanics


    Usage Tips

        This set should neither be played as a wall or a completely offensive Pokemon, it is supposed to switch into certain Pokemon and hit hard back while gaining momentum
        RestTalk allows it to not get worn down and consistently wall Pokemon such as Talonflame or Thundurus
        Volt switch is Mega Ampharos’s “spammable” move, as it will at the worst get switch initiative on every Pokemon that isn't a ground type (Mold breaker is somewhat useful here, as volt absorbers can’t stop Mega Ampharos from getting momentum).




    Team Options
    ========

        Works well with a volt-turn core that it can be a part of.
        Genesect can revenge kill faster dragon and ground types who force Mega Ampharos out, and Ampharos deals with many of the Pokemon who stop Genesect, such as Heatran, defensive Rotom Wash, and Talonflame.

        Skarmory can switch into dragon and ground moves,while mega Ampharos takes the electric and fire moves that force Skarmory out. Skarmory also switches into Excadrill, which is a huge problem for Ampharos
        Helps teams that struggle with stall, as while most stall teams will have counters, it will be very hard for stall teams to kill Mega Ampharos due to RestTalk

    Tank
    ########
    name: Bulky Attacker
    move 1:Volt Switch
    move 2:Dragon Pulse
    move 3:Focus Blast
    move 4:Heal Bell/Thunderbolt/discharge
    ability:Static
    item:Ampharosite
    evs:252 Spa/20 Spe/236 Hp
    nature: Modest

    Moves
    ========

        Volt Switch is once again the main move, hitting decently hard while getting momentum for Mega Ampharo's team
        Dragon Pulse is the only option as Dragon STAB, and is a consistent, albeit slightly weak move
        Focus Blast destroys many common switch-ins to Amoharos, such as Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn
        Heal Bell is a rare move and can provide important team support, and is the recommended option for this set
        Thunderbolt is a more reliable Electric Stab, and is Mega Ampharos's most powerful move on this set, but Volt Switch is usually better. Discharge can also be used for the paralysis chance, which can be useful due to Mega Amoharos's low speed


    Set Details

        20 Speed is once again to outspeed 0 speed Hippowdon, who would other wise threaten Mega Ampharos with Earthquake
        If on a trick room team, use a quiet nature with 0 speed and 0 speed IVs.
        252 Special attack is to hit as hard as possible, as this set is a bulky tank that is supposed to dish out a lot of damage. The rest is in HP to take hits, which is necessary due to Mega Ampharos's slowness.


    Usage Tips

        This set is meant to be played as a tank
        It hits much harder than Rest-Talk, but loses its ability to repeatedly switch into status and weaker attackers
        Still a good switch-in to many Pokemon, especially bulky Water, Electric, Fire, and Grass Types


    Team Options

        Still synergises well with Skarmory and Genesect as stated before
        Almost any teammate appreciates the use of Heal Bell, as any Pokemon can be crippled by the right status
        Needs teammates that can beat special walls, as this set struggles to take them down and is easily stalled out. Any physical attacker, such as Scizor or Terrakion make great partners
        Works very well on a trick room team due to combination of bulk, power, and low speed




    Other Options
    ########

        Thunder can be used on a rain team, but is still inconsistent due to lack of consistent rain, making it a risky option no matter what
        Agility can be used to make up for Mega Ampharo's low speed, although it is still fairly slow even after an agility, and isn't powerful enough to make up for it, making this set more trouble than its worth
        Signal Beam can be used to beat Celebi, but is generally useless otherwise


    Checks & Counters
    ########

        Specially defensive Hippowdon is the best counter to Mega Ampharos, refusing to be 2hkoed by anything in its arsenal, while it can Earthquake it back for a 2hko. It also blocks Mega Ampharos's Volt Switch
        Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill counter the RestTalk set, although all can be Ohkoed by a Focus Blast from the Bulky Attacker set
        Special walls such as Blissey or Sylveon can easily stall it out, although it ends up in a stall war with the RestTalk set, but Mega Ampharos can get the advantage with its Volt Switch
        It can be easily revenged killed by nearly anything due to its low speed
