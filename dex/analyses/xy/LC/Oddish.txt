Overview
########

Oddish is the bulkiest and most powerful special attacker of all Chlorophyll users. This makes it a viable sweeper in the sun, though it faces competition from Bellsprout and Bulbasaur; both have access to Growth, and Bellsprout has access to Weather Ball. Oddish is also difficult to revenge kill, as it is very fast in the sun and resists Fairy-, Fighting-, Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks, including common priority attacks including Aqua Jet and Mach Punch, whilst being able to use Sleep Powder on Sucker Punch users. Although it is weak to common attacks such as Fletchling's Acrobatics, Oddish is quite bulky and can sweep teams as long as the sun is up.

Chlorophyll Sweeper
########
Name: Chlorophyll Sweeper
Move 1: Solar Beam / Giga Drain
Move 2: Sludge Bomb
Move 3: Hidden Power Fire
Move 4: Sleep Powder
Ability: Chlorophyll
Item: Life Orb
EVs: 240 SpA / 200 Spe
Nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Oddish's most powerful attack is Solar Beam, which hits without charging in the sun. It heavily damages anything that doesn't resist it, though it might not be as reliable as Giga Drain, which will hit regardless of whether or not the sun is up, albeit for less power. Sludge Bomb nails Grass- and Fairy-type Pokemon, particularly Cottonee and Spritzee. Hidden Power Fire covers the Steel-types Solar Beam and Sludge Bomb fail to hit, including Pawniard, Magnemite and Ferroseed. Sleep Powder incapacitates a foe too bulky for Oddish to deal with. It's also useful for bringing back the sun if it is about to be cut short by giving Vulpix a free turn to switch in.

Set Details
========

In order for Oddish to sweep effectively, it needs 240 Special Attack EVs. A Life Orb will make its attacks hit extremely hard. 200 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow it to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Pawniard and Drilbur under the sun.

Usage Tips
========

Without Eviolite, Oddish is too frail to be switched in, especially if it has racked up residual damage from entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, so it should only be brought in on a Grass- or Water-type attack. Oddish should attempt to sweep late-game once its counters are removed, but it can also force switches and put heavy dents in opponents in order for a teammate to finish them off late-game. However, Oddish isn't useful if the sun isn't up, so if the sun is about to end, it can use Sleep Powder on an opponent so that Vulpix can come back in and set up the sun.

Team Options
========

Oddish needs a teammate to set up the sun, and Drought Vulpix is the best choice. In addition, other Chlorophyll users such as Bulbasaur and Bellsprout can be considered for teammates, as they can help break down opposing teams. Eviolite Chinchou and Archen are helpful with removing the Fire- and Flying-types Oddish can't take on and can even provide a safe switch-in for Oddish with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Drilbur can provide Rapid Spin support, which is quite helpful for Oddish, as damage from Life Orb and entry hazards will wear it down very quickly. A Steel-type such as Magnemite or Pawniard can reliably check Oddish's Flying-type counters such as Vullaby and Fletchling. Oddish enjoys having entry hazards of its own to wear down its bulkier opponents. Dwebble and Archen both can set them up, while Archen can also provide Defog support and reliably check other Flying-types such as Vullaby and Fletchling.

Eviolite
########
Name: Eviolite
move 1: Solar Beam / Giga Drain
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Sleep Powder
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Eviolite
evs: 76 Def / 160 SpA / 200 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Oddish's most powerful STAB option is Solar Beam. Although Giga Drain is weaker than Solar Beam, it's a useful alternative, as it ensures Oddish isn't left waiting a turn to charge if the sun runs out or the weather is changed by an opposing weather inducer. Sludge Bomb is a reliable STAB that nails Grass- and Fairy-types, particularly Cottonee and Spritzee, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire is mostly for hitting Steel-types that resist Oddish's STAB moves for super effective damage, including Pawniard, Magnemite, and Ferroseed. Sleep Powder is useful for incapacitating a foe Oddish can't push past, or for bringing back the sun if it is about to be cut short. It can also be used to incapacitate Sucker Punch users such as Pawniard.

Set Details
========

Oddish is the bulkiest Chlorophyll sweeper in the tier and is even bulkier with Eviolite. For instance, it can take an itemless Acrobatics from Fletchling and avoid a OHKO all but 6.3% of the time with 76 Defense EVs. Oddish needs 160 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature for its attacks to hit hard, as well as 200 Speed EVs with Chlorophyll in order to outspeed all unboosted threats in the sun. This also allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Chinchou and Magnemite and tie with others such as Pawniard and Drilbur.

Usage Tips
========

With Eviolite, Oddish is quite bulky and can therefore switch in more easily than other Chlorophyll users. It can switch into common threats such as Cottonee, Croagunk, Timburr, Mienfoo, and Chinchou quite comfortably and start attacking from there. Oddish should be brought in whenever the sun is up to put heavy offensive pressure on an opponent or to simply sweep once threats such as Vullaby and Fletchling are taken out. Sleep Powder can be used so Oddish has time to switch out and get its sun back if it is about to run out. It can also cripple a threat that Oddish is unable to beat.

Team Options
========

Vulpix is an important team mate for Oddish, as it sets up the sun that the latter requires to sweep. Another Chlorophyll user such as Bellsprout or Bulbasaur can be considered in order to overwhelm an opponent with offensive pressure; however, this puts even more pressure on the team's Flying-type checks to do their job. Archen is able to check Oddish's deadliest counters, including Flying- and Fire-types. It's also capable of providing support by removing entry hazards as well as setting up its own, which is very welcome for this set, as Eviolite Oddish lacks the power it would have with Life Orb, and thus appreciates having walls worn down. A Steel-type teammate such as Magnemite and Pawniard is able to check Flying-types such as Vullaby and Archen. They also resist the Ice- and Psychic-type moves Oddish is weak to, while Oddish is bulky enough to come in on the Fighting-type moves they are weak to. A teammate to remove hazards, such as Drilbur or the aforementioned Archen is important as well, as although Oddish may be bulky, it cannot take hits so easily if it has taken too much entry hazard damage.

Other Options
########

Dazzling Gleam is an option to hit Vullaby and Scraggy hard, but it has little other use. Oddish can also use Moonlight or Synthesis on the Eviolite set for recovery, which both heal for two-thirds of its health in the sun.

Checks & Counters
########

**Snover**: Snover removes the sun Oddish needs and can come in on a Sleep Powder, Giga Drain, or a charging Solar Beam and OHKO Oddish with Blizzard.

**Fletchling**: Fletchling can come in on anything but Sludge Bomb and OHKO Life Orb Oddish with Acrobatics.

**Vullaby**: Vullaby OHKOes Oddish with Brave Bird, can't be put to sleep and is rarely 2HKOed by Sludge Bomb.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Larvesta and Ponyta are great checks to Oddish, as their Fire-type attacks are boosted by the sun Oddish uses. They can consistently check Oddish if one of their teammates are sleeping due to Sleep Clause.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Porygon, Munchlax, and Lickitung are all bulky enough to tank a Solar Beam and fire off an attack in return.
