<p>So I get there, get in, and start battling.</p>

<h3>Round 1</h3>

<p>This guy knows about EVs, but doesn't use them. Someone gave him a team. All I remember is that he had a Salamence. It was pretty easy.</p>

<p>4-0</p>

<h3>Round 2</h3>

<p>This is the guy dressed as a Jolteon. He led with Marowak/Weezing and Exploded with Weezing, however it didn't KO either of my pokes.
I don't really remember the rest.</p>

<p>3-0</p>

<h3>Round 3</h3>

<p>This guy was on Smogon, I don't remember his (user) name, though. He led Smeargle and something else, but Smeargle was KO'd before he could move. I asked the guy if it was Scarfed, but he didn't say anything, though he looked sheepish. This match was easy, too.</p>

<p>4-0</p>

<h3>Round 4</h3>

<p>This battle was on the screen. He lead I think Snorlax-Raikou. Both shiny. I thought nothing of this. Then my Weavile's Low Kick didn't KO his 1/2 health Snorlax. Then Palkia's Thunder did about 1/2 to his Kyogre. I didn't know it, but everyone in the crowd was saying that he hacked. My dad even has on video the end of the match and a guy in the crowd saying, "JRankin" (my trainer name) "protest!" Someone went and got Marriland, and after the battle (I lost) he hack checked. The kid had all 31 IV in every stat on all his pokes, they were all shiny, and they had 255 EVs in EVERY STAT. He got DQ'd. So I'm in the finalists lounge.</p>

<p>I got in there quite early, so I had to wait for about and hour and a half, and was so nervous I peed three times. I was the little kid with the red backpack, if anyone saw me. I talked to Biffster right after he got beat, was too scared to say anything to Alaka, Tyler422, or OmegaDonut, but I did talk to Kongler briefly. When everybody was done, we drew for byes. I got one. So round 5 begins.</p>

<h3>Round 5</h3>

<p>I face some guy who had apparently just got out of high school as he said the song playing was his graduation song. He lead Gardevoir-Umbreon, and used Confuse Ray with the Umbreon, forcing me to switch several times. In the middle of the battle he wanted a hack check, but Marriland said another one would be redudant, because all the finalists had had their's checked already. This battle was pretty easy, though the score says otherwise.</p>

<p>2-0</p>

<h3>Round 6</h3>

<p>Yes! I had an invite to Nats! This is where I met my downfall, though, losing to the guy in second place. The video number is 94-17639-47983. I had no idea what Tangrowth could do, unfortunately, and I never had a chance.</p>

<p>0-3</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun, but I might not be at Nationals. My dad really doesn't want to make the 12-hour drive, and I'm not sure if I would even do well.</p>
