[page]

<p>It was time. The MAC had matured enough to be ready for such a challenge, and Smeargle's Studio had developed enough of a jaw-line to take anything on the chin. The theme: to depict the Studio itself. This could range from the people involved to&mdash;well, anything really. Fortunately, the entries turned out quite favorable towards Smeargle's Studio, meaning that the hosting of the contest wasn't for naught!</p>
